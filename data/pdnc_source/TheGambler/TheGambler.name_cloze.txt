TheGambler	54	736	683	737	Mlle	What I have said I have said merely as a warning. To do so is no more than my right." When returning home with the children before luncheon, I met a cavalcade of our party riding to view some ruins. Two splendid carriages, magnificently horsed, with [MASK].
TheGambler	48	837	790	838	Mlle	I calculated that, with the 4000 francs which I had brought with me, added to what my patrons seemed already to have acquired, the party must be in possession of at least 7000 or 8000 francs though that would be none too much for [MASK].
TheGambler	51	1273	1249	1300	Polina	How he had come to make the General s acquaintance I do not know, but, apparently, he was much struck with [MASK]. Also, he was delighted that I should sit next him at table, for he appeared to look upon me as his bosom friend.
TheGambler	55	1761	1742	1797	Monsignor	They did so as soon as I told them the story of how once I threatened to spit into [MASK] s coffee." "To spit into it?" the General inquired with grave disapproval in his tone, and a stare, of astonishment, while the Frenchman looked at me unbelievingly.
TheGambler	42	1960	1944	1986	Monsignor	As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an adjoining room and ask for [MASK]; after which I saw the sacristan make a low bow to the visitor, and then another bow as the visitor took his leave.
TheGambler	45	2078	2059	2104	Monsignor	This made me very angry. I rose, approached the sacristan, and told him that, since [MASK] was receiving callers, his lordship might just as well finish off my affair as well. Upon this the sacristan shrunk back in astonishment.
TheGambler	49	2163	2126	2175	Monsignor	In a tone of the utmost effrontery, as though he were delighted to have a chance of insulting me, he looked me up and down, and then said: "Do you suppose that [MASK] is going to put aside his coffee for _you?_
TheGambler	49	2222	2176	2225	Monsignor	" But I only cried the louder: "Let me tell you that I am going to _spit_ into that coffee! Yes, and if you do not get me my passport visaed this very minute, I shall take it to [MASK] myself."
TheGambler	50	3372	3337	3387	Polina	"Then he has only just begun his courting? Why, I thought he had been doing so a long while!" "You _know_ he has not," retorted [MASK] angrily. "But where on earth did you pick up this Englishman?"
TheGambler	48	3416	3395	3443	Astley	"I _knew_ you would ask about him!" Whereupon I told her of my previous encounters with [MASK] while travelling. "He is very shy," I said, "and susceptible. Also, he is in love with you."
TheGambler	50	3553	3547	3597	Polina	"And why?" asked [MASK]. "Because, though the Frenchman is the handsomer of the two, he is also the baser; whereas the Englishman is not only a man of honour, but ten times the wealthier of the pair." "Yes?
TheGambler	51	3633	3618	3669	Polina	"Is that so?" I repeated. "Yes; absolutely." [MASK] was not at all pleased at my questions; I could see that she was doing her best to irritate me with the brusquerie of her answers. But I took no notice of this.
TheGambler	47	3756	3711	3758	Polina	"I consider that I have a perfect right to put these questions to you," was my calm retort; "for the reason that I am ready to pay for them, and also care little what becomes of me." [MASK] giggled.
TheGambler	48	3918	3871	3919	Mlle	Then she made a movement to rise. Her tone had sounded very angry. Indeed, of late her talks with me had invariably ended on a note of temper and irritation yes, of real temper. "May I ask you who is this [MASK].
TheGambler	50	3984	3984	4034	Blanche	[MASK], with her mother and her cousin, the Marquis, know very well that, as things now stand, we are ruined." "And is the General at last in love?" "That has nothing to do with it. Listen to me.
TheGambler	56	4072	4035	4091	Nadia	Take these 700 florins, and go and play roulette with them. Win as much for me as you can, for I am badly in need of money." So saying, she called [MASK] back to her side, and entered the Casino, where she joined the rest of our party.
TheGambler	48	6811	6811	6859	Polina	[MASK] s money I decided to risk, that evening, only to the amount of 100 g lden. The thought that I was not going to play for myself quite unnerved me. It was an unpleasant sensation, and I tried hard to banish it.
TheGambler	50	6873	6831	6881	Polina	The thought that I was not going to play for myself quite unnerved me. It was an unpleasant sensation, and I tried hard to banish it. I had a feeling that, once I had begun to play for [MASK], I should wreck my own fortunes.
TheGambler	58	8579	8579	8637	Blanche	[MASK]? It was said of her that she was a Frenchwoman of good birth who, living with her mother, possessed a colossal fortune. It was also said that she was some relation to the Marquis, but only a distant one a cousin, or cousin-german, or something of the sort.
TheGambler	43	8785	8785	8828	Astley	[MASK] was a man so shy, reserved, and taciturn in his manner that one might have looked for anything from him. At all events the Frenchman accorded him only the slightest of greetings, and scarcely even looked at him.
TheGambler	55	8979	8979	9034	Blanche	[MASK]. The poor General was in despair! To fall in love at fifty-five, and with such vehemence, is indeed a misfortune! And add to that his widowerhood, his children, his ruined property, his debts, and the woman with whom he had fallen in love!
TheGambler	49	9036	8988	9037	Mlle	To fall in love at fifty-five, and with such vehemence, is indeed a misfortune! And add to that his widowerhood, his children, his ruined property, his debts, and the woman with whom he had fallen in love! Though [MASK].
TheGambler	41	9038	9038	9079	Blanche	[MASK] was extremely good-looking, I may or may not be understood when I say that she had one of those faces which one is afraid of. At all events, I myself have always feared such women.
TheGambler	52	9421	9395	9447	Mademoiselle	During the last two weeks I had looked for much to transpire, but am still ignorant whether at that time anything decisive ever passed between [MASK] and the General. Everything seemed to depend upon our means upon whether the General would be able to flourish sufficient money in her face.
TheGambler	51	9463	9463	9514	Blanche	[MASK], I felt sure, would disappear in a twinkling. Indeed, it surprised and amused me to observe what a passion for intrigue I was developing. But how I loathed it all! With what pleasure would I have given everybody and everything the go-by!
TheGambler	48	9802	9755	9803	Mlle	Yet never did he lose any chance of speaking to myself; and, one morning when we had met, and exchanged a couple of words, he burst out in his usual abrupt way, without saying "Good-morning." "That [MASK].
TheGambler	54	9877	9824	9878	Mlle	After that he was silent as he looked me meaningly in the face. What he meant I did not know, but to my glance of inquiry he returned only a dry nod, and a reiterated "It is so." Presently, however, he resumed: "Does [MASK].
TheGambler	52	9879	9879	9931	Polina	[MASK] like flowers?" "I really cannot say," was my reply. "What? You cannot say?" he cried in great astonishment. "No; I have never noticed whether she does so or not," I repeated with a smile.
TheGambler	44	10925	10913	10957	Polina	He appeared to be suspicious as to something being on foot between [MASK] and myself, but I merely fired up, and replied that the money had been all my own. At this the General seemed extremely surprised, and asked me whence
TheGambler	43	11445	11441	11484	Russians	None the less we [MASK] often need money; wherefore, we are glad of, and greatly devoted to, a method of acquisition like roulette whereby, in a couple of hours, one may grow rich without doing any work.
TheGambler	48	12512	12473	12521	Hoppe	Yes, there you have it in a nutshell. For my own part, I would rather grow fat after the Russian manner, or squander my whole substance at roulette. I have no wish to be [MASK] and Company at the end of five generations.
TheGambler	56	12691	12689	12745	Polina	As for [MASK], she had looked on with serene indifference. She seemed to have heard neither my voice nor any other during the progress of the meal. V Yes, she had been extraordinarily meditative. Yet, on leaving the table, she immediately ordered me to accompany her for a walk.
TheGambler	46	13008	13008	13054	Blanche	[MASK], " I remarked; "for in such an event she would never become Madame General. Do you know, I believe the old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot himself if she should throw him over.
TheGambler	48	13086	13055	13103	Polina	At his age it is a dangerous thing to fall in love." "Yes, something, I believe, _will_ happen to him," assented [MASK] thoughtfully. "And what a fine thing it all is!" I continued. "
TheGambler	46	13625	13625	13671	Polina	[MASK] looked surprised. "What?" she said. "Do not you also hope something from it? Did you not tell me again and again, two weeks ago, that you were certain of winning at roulette if you played here?
TheGambler	48	13889	13875	13923	Polina	"I do not care whether you are so or not," answered [MASK] with calm indifference. "Well, since you ask me, I _do_ doubt your ability to take anything seriously. You are capable of worrying, but not deeply.
TheGambler	55	14149	14113	14168	Russians	By that I mean that, though I am a man of self-respect, I am unable to carry off a situation properly. Do you know the reason? It is because we [MASK] are too richly and multifariously gifted to be able at once to find the proper mode of expression.
TheGambler	55	14335	14291	14346	Frenchmen	But a tweaking of the nose he cannot bear, for the reason that such an act is an infringement of the accepted, of the time-hallowed order of decorum. That is why our good ladies are so fond of [MASK] the Frenchman s manners, they say, are perfect!
TheGambler	54	14394	14394	14448	Cocks	[MASK] may be excellent birds. If I am wrong you must stop me. You ought to stop and correct me more often when I am speaking to you, for I am too apt to say everything that is in my head. "You see, I have lost my manners.
TheGambler	55	15336	15307	15362	Splendid	" she said drily, and (I think) with wilful offensiveness. "_That_ would have been of no use to me." "[MASK]!" I shouted. "I know well that you must have used the words of no use in order to crush me. _
TheGambler	51	17376	17347	17398	Polina	d tre votre esclave." Then I bowed again, put on my hat, and walked past the Baron with a rude smile on my face. [MASK] had ordered me merely to take off my hat: the bow and the general effrontery were of my own invention.
TheGambler	55	18929	18903	18958	Baroness	Once and for all I must endeavour to rid myself of you and your impertinence. To justify yourself in the eyes of the Baron and [MASK] will be impossible. Any intercourse with you, even though it be confined to a begging of their pardons, they would look upon as a degradation.
TheGambler	49	20262	20219	20268	Polina	This fact I took into my calculations, and duly noted it, for, of course, he _might_ apply to the authorities tomorrow, and it behoved me to go carefully. Yet it was not the General but [MASK] that I wanted to anger.
TheGambler	52	20399	20388	20440	Polina	Let people see what they _would_ see. Let [MASK], for once, have a good fright, and be forced to whistle me to heel again. But, however much she might whistle, she should see that I was at least no draggle-tailed cockerel!
TheGambler	52	20494	20485	20537	Madame	What can that mean? The maid declares that [MASK] packed her trunks early in the day. Yet how is it that no one else seems to have been aware of the circumstance? Or is it that _I_ have been the only person to be unaware of it?
TheGambler	50	22459	22416	22466	Mlle	"I do not care," I replied, "seeing that I no longer belong to his household" (of set purpose I was trying to talk as senselessly as possible). "But is it quite settled that [MASK]. is to marry the General?
TheGambler	47	23319	23318	23365	Polina	In [MASK] s handwriting I read: "I hear that you are thinking of going on with this affair. You have lost your temper now, and are beginning to play the fool! Certain circumstances, however, I may explain to you later.
TheGambler	50	23429	23406	23456	POLINA	I ask you to be obedient. If necessary, I shall even _bid_ you be obedient. Your own" [MASK]. "_P.S._ If so be that you still bear a grudge against me for what happened last night, pray forgive me."
TheGambler	51	23528	23483	23534	Mlle	Meanwhile, the cursed Frenchman was eyeing me discreetly and askance, as though he wished to avoid witnessing my confusion. It would have been better if he had laughed outright. "Very well," I said, "you can tell [MASK]. not to disturb herself.
TheGambler	44	23876	23833	23877	Polina	Firstly, I asked myself, which of the absurd, boyish, and extravagant threats which I had uttered at random last night had made everybody so alarmed? Secondly, what was the influence which this Frenchman appeared to exercise over [MASK]?
TheGambler	52	24038	24016	24068	VIII	Hence, he must have got her into his power somehow somehow he must be holding her as in a vice. [MASK] All at once, on the Promenade, as it was called that is to say, in the Chestnut Avenue I came face to face with my Englishman.
TheGambler	50	24179	24133	24183	Whither	Not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment. Indeed, I have never heard any one speak of it." "Then how come you to know it?" "Because I have had occasion to do so. [MASK] are you bound?
TheGambler	48	24297	24268	24316	Astley	The caf in question was only a hundred paces away; so, when coffee had been brought, we seated ourselves, and I lit a cigarette. [MASK] was no smoker, but, taking a seat by my side, he prepared himself to listen.
TheGambler	53	24384	24332	24385	Polina	"I intend, on the contrary, to remain here." "That I never doubted," he answered good-humouredly. It is a curious fact that, on my way to see him, I had never even thought of telling him of my love for [MASK].
TheGambler	46	24687	24687	24733	Polina	[MASK] you know nothing beyond surmise?" Again I was surprised that such a categorical question should come from such a reserved individual. "No, I know nothing _for certain_ about them" was my reply. "No nothing."
TheGambler	42	24919	24919	24961	Polina	[MASK] well, you yourself know that, if necessity drives, one enters into relation with people whom one simply detests. Even between this couple there may be something which, though unknown to you, depends upon extraneous circumstances.
TheGambler	43	24984	24942	24985	Mlle	Even between this couple there may be something which, though unknown to you, depends upon extraneous circumstances. For, my own part, I think that you may reassure yourself or at all events partially. And as for [MASK].
TheGambler	50	25135	25135	25185	Polina	[MASK] herself?" In return he gave me an astonished stare. "Your eyes look very fiery," he said with a return of his former calm, "and in them I can read suspicion. Now, you have no right whatever to be suspicious.
TheGambler	47	25385	25342	25389	Astley	On the contrary, my relations had been purely fantastic, strange, and unreal; they had been unlike anything else that I could think of. "Very well, very well," I replied with a warmth equal to [MASK] s own. "
TheGambler	41	25563	25536	25577	Polina	And, mark you, although he came to me as early as nine o clock, he had ready-prepared in his hand Mlle. [MASK] s note. When, I would ask, was that note written?
TheGambler	54	25580	25580	25634	Polina	[MASK] must have been aroused from sleep for the express purpose of writing it. At all events the circumstance shows that she is an absolute slave to the Frenchman, since she actually begs my pardon in the note actually begs my pardon! Yet what is her personal concern in the matter?
TheGambler	53	25677	25625	25678	Mlle	Yet what is her personal concern in the matter? Why is she interested in it at all? Why, too, is the whole party so afraid of this precious Baron? And what sort of a business do you call it for the General to be going to marry [MASK].
TheGambler	44	25818	25818	25862	Blanche	[MASK] has, in very truth, a special reason for wishing to avoid any trouble with the Baron and the Baroness. It might lead not only to some unpleasantness, but even to a scandal." "Oh, oh!"
TheGambler	56	26169	26169	26225	Blanche	[MASK] played trente et quarante with fair success, but, later, her luck took a marked change for the worse. I distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost an enormous sum. But worse was to ensue, for one fine morning her prince disappeared horses, carriage, and all.
TheGambler	49	26240	26192	26241	Mlle	I distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost an enormous sum. But worse was to ensue, for one fine morning her prince disappeared horses, carriage, and all. Also, the hotel bill which he left unpaid was enormous. Upon this [MASK].
TheGambler	46	26304	26259	26305	Mlle	She shrieked and howled all over the hotel, and even tore her clothes in her frenzy. In the hotel there was staying also a Polish count (you must know that ALL travelling Poles are counts!), and the spectacle of [MASK].
TheGambler	41	26306	26306	26347	Zelma	[MASK] tearing her clothes and, catlike, scratching her face with her beautiful, scented nails produced upon him a strong impression. So the pair had a talk together, and, by luncheon time, she was consoled.
TheGambler	53	26503	26451	26504	Mlle	To the annoyance of the decent public they are allowed to remain here at all events such of them as daily change 4000 franc notes at the tables (though, as soon as ever these women cease to do so, they receive an invitation to depart). However, [MASK].
TheGambler	50	26874	26859	26909	Mlle	Consequently you yourself will see that, until the marriage shall have been consummated, [MASK]. would scarcely like to have the attention of the Baron and the Baroness drawn to herself. In short, to any one in her position, a scandal would be most detrimental.
TheGambler	42	26951	26910	26952	Mlle	You form a member of the m nage of these people; wherefore, any act of yours might cause such a scandal and the more so since daily she appears in public arm in arm with the General or with [MASK].
TheGambler	43	26953	26953	26996	Polina	[MASK]. _Now_ do you understand?" "No, I do not!" I shouted as I banged my fist down upon the table banged it with such violence that a frightened waiter came running towards us. "
TheGambler	45	27060	27060	27105	Blanche	[MASK]). "How could you do it?" "It would have done no good to warn you," he replied quietly, "for the reason that you could have effected nothing. Against what was I to warn you?
TheGambler	54	27116	27063	27117	Mlle	"How could you do it?" "It would have done no good to warn you," he replied quietly, "for the reason that you could have effected nothing. Against what was I to warn you? As likely as not, the General knows more about [MASK].
TheGambler	43	27231	27189	27232	Mlle	As he passed I looked at him, and the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever. However, it is no affair of mine, for I have only recently had the happiness to make [MASK].
TheGambler	48	27233	27233	27281	Polina	[MASK] s acquaintance. Also" he added this as an afterthought "I have already told you that I do not recognise your right to ask me certain questions, however sincere be my liking for you." "Enough," I said, rising.
TheGambler	56	27292	27237	27293	Mlle	Also" he added this as an afterthought "I have already told you that I do not recognise your right to ask me certain questions, however sincere be my liking for you." "Enough," I said, rising. "To me it is as clear as day that [MASK].
TheGambler	52	27327	27327	27379	Blanche	[MASK]. You may be sure that nothing else would ever have induced her either to walk about with this Frenchwoman or to send me a note not to touch the Baron. Yes, it is _there_ that the influence lies before which everything in the world must bow!
TheGambler	47	27439	27439	27486	Polina	[MASK], the General s step-daughter, has a younger brother and sister who, though they are the General s own children, are completely neglected by this madman, and robbed as well." "Yes, yes; that is so.
TheGambler	41	27733	27733	27774	Polina	[MASK] a dowry. As soon as ever the money is received, she will throw herself upon the Frenchman s neck. All women are like that. Even the proudest of them become abject slaves where marriage is concerned.
TheGambler	51	27776	27737	27788	Polina	As soon as ever the money is received, she will throw herself upon the Frenchman s neck. All women are like that. Even the proudest of them become abject slaves where marriage is concerned. What [MASK] is good for is to fall head over ears in love.
TheGambler	50	27824	27789	27839	Polina	That is _my_ opinion. Look at her especially when she is sitting alone, and plunged in thought. All this was pre-ordained and foretold, and is accursed. [MASK] could perpetrate any mad act. She she But who called me by name?
TheGambler	48	28532	28523	28571	Potapitch	Or do you not recognise me? Here, [MASK]!" she cried to an old servant who, dressed in a frock coat and white waistcoat, had a bald, red head (he was the chamberlain who always accompanied her on her journeys).
TheGambler	52	28921	28917	28969	Potapitch	"And you, [MASK], you go and tell that fool of a landlord to reserve me a suitable suite of rooms. They must be handsomely decorated, and not too high up. Have my luggage taken up to them. But what are you tumbling over yourselves for?
TheGambler	55	29077	29060	29115	Madame	Now, take me upstairs, direct to their rooms. Where are they lodging?" [MASK] was lifted up in her chair by the lacqueys, and I preceded her up the grand staircase. Our progress was exceedingly effective, for everyone whom we met stopped to stare at the cort ge.
TheGambler	51	30518	30518	30569	Blanche	[MASK] with an elegant, ceremonious bow as, under cover of an unwonted modesty, she endeavoured to express, both in face and figure, her extreme surprise at such strange behaviour on the part of the Grandmother. "How the woman sticks out her eyes at me!
TheGambler	49	31604	31587	31636	Theodosia	"Doubtless we could find bearers for the purpose," I interposed. At this moment [MASK], the nursemaid, approached the old lady with the General s children. "No, I _don t_ want to see them," said the Grandmother.
TheGambler	54	31656	31637	31691	Theodosia	"I hate kissing children, for their noses are always wet. How are you getting on, [MASK]?" "I am very well, thank you, Madame," replied the nursemaid. "And how is your ladyship? We have been feeling so anxious about you!"
TheGambler	50	31717	31682	31732	Polina	We have been feeling so anxious about you!" "Yes, I know, you simple soul But who are those other guests?" the old lady continued, turning again to [MASK]. "For instance, who is that old rascal in the spectacles?"
TheGambler	41	31919	31879	31920	French	" This was interpreted to the Grandmother, and she seemed much gratified. "How well English people know how to answer one!" she remarked. "That is why I like them so much better than [MASK].
TheGambler	54	32009	32001	32055	Prascovia	"I could almost have liked you, [MASK]," suddenly she remarked, "for you are a nice girl the best of the lot. You have some character about you. I too have character. Turn round. Surely that is not false hair that you are wearing?"
TheGambler	51	32059	32036	32087	Grandmamma	I too have character. Turn round. Surely that is not false hair that you are wearing?" "No, [MASK]. It is my own." "Well, well. I do not like the stupid fashions of today. You are very good looking.
TheGambler	50	33740	33711	33761	Potapitch	_You_, though, I perceive, are a blockhead a man who does not even know how to carry his breeding. Lift me up. [MASK], see to it that you always have _two_ bearers ready. Go and arrange for their hire.
TheGambler	41	34223	34222	34263	Martha	"[MASK], _you_ must come with me as well," went on the old lady to her maid. "No, no, mother!" ejaculated the General. "Really she cannot come.
TheGambler	47	34269	34245	34292	Potapitch	"No, no, mother!" ejaculated the General. "Really she cannot come. They would not admit even [MASK] to the Casino." "Rubbish! Because she is my servant, is that a reason for turning her out?
TheGambler	52	34722	34715	34767	Polina	On the other side of the chair [MASK] had to answer an endless flow of petty questions such as "Who was it passed just now?" "Who is that coming along?" "Is the town a large one?" "Are the public gardens extensive?"
TheGambler	55	34811	34777	34832	Astley	"What is the name of those hills?" "Do I see eagles flying yonder?" "What is that absurd-looking building?" and so forth. Meanwhile [MASK] whispered to me, as he walked by my side, that he looked for much to happen that morning.
TheGambler	52	37194	37191	37243	Madame	"But, [MASK], zero has only this moment turned up," I remonstrated; "wherefore, it may not do so again for ever so long. Wait a little, and you may then have a better chance." "Rubbish! Stake, please."
TheGambler	48	38209	38196	38244	Zero	At length the ball dropped off into one of the notches. "[MASK]!" cried the croupier. "Ah!!!" screamed the old lady as she turned to me in a whirl of triumph. I myself was at heart a gambler.
TheGambler	42	38440	38431	38473	Potapitch	This time the old lady did not call for [MASK]; for that she was too preoccupied. Though not outwardly shaken by the event (indeed, she seemed perfectly calm), she was trembling inwardly from head to foot.
TheGambler	50	38792	38757	38807	Astley	Everywhere people kept pointing to the Grandmother, and talking about her. Many people even walked beside her chair, in order to view her the better while, at a little distance, [MASK] was carrying on a conversation on the subject with two English acquaintances of his.
TheGambler	48	38966	38919	38967	Potapitch	However, I calculated that the sum would exceed seven thousand roubles or, at the present rate of exchange, even eight thousand. "Eight thousand roubles! What a splendid thing! And to think of you simpletons sitting there and doing nothing! [MASK]!
TheGambler	46	38989	38970	39016	Martha	See what I have won!" "How _did_ you do it, Madame?" [MASK] exclaimed ecstatically. "Eight thousand roubles!" "And I am going to give you fifty g lden apiece. There they are."
TheGambler	51	39277	39259	39310	Theodosia	The latter looked confused, and seemed greatly relieved when we reached the Avenue. "How surprised [MASK] too will be!" went on the Grandmother (thinking of the General s nursemaid). "She, like yourselves, shall have the price of a new gown.
TheGambler	51	39421	39418	39469	Madame	"No, [MASK]." "Yet just now I could see that you were burning to do so?" "I _do_ mean to try my luck presently." "Then stake everything upon zero. You have seen how it ought to be done?
TheGambler	49	39812	39812	39861	Blanche	[MASK]. "What has that got to do with _you?_" retorted the old lady. "It is not _your_ money that I am going to lose; it is my own. And where is that Mr. Astley of yours?"
TheGambler	48	39922	39891	39939	Theodosia	Arriving home, and meeting the landlord on the staircase, the Grandmother called him to her side, and boasted to him of her winnings thereafter doing the same to [MASK], and conferring upon her thirty g lden; after which she bid her serve luncheon.
TheGambler	54	40030	40002	40056	Potapitch	Never in my life have I seen so much money. And there were gentlefolk around it, and other gentlefolk sitting down. So, I asked [MASK] where all these gentry had come from; for, thought I, maybe the Holy Mother of God will help our mistress among them.
TheGambler	47	40967	40963	41010	Polina	But the thought of [MASK] was torture to me. That her fate was settled I already had an inkling; yet _that_ was not the thought which was giving me so much uneasiness. What I really wished for was to penetrate her secrets.
TheGambler	51	41174	41124	41175	Polina	How can I ever bring myself to leave her? On reaching the third storey of the hotel I experienced a shock. I was just passing the General s suite when something caused me to look round. Out of a door about twenty paces away there was coming [MASK]!
TheGambler	47	41338	41313	41360	Astley	But she had vanished again. Aha! So the two were carrying on a correspondence! However, I set off to search for [MASK] first at his hotel, and then at the Casino, where I went the round of the salons in vain.
TheGambler	43	41718	41718	41761	Blanche	[MASK] s excited, impudently abusive tongue and the General s plaintive wail as, apparently, he sought to justify himself in something. But on my appearance every one stopped speaking, and tried to put a better face upon matters.
TheGambler	54	41814	41814	41868	Blanche	[MASK] did not trouble to conceal the wrath that was sparkling in her countenance, but bent her gaze upon me with an air of impatient expectancy. I may remark that hitherto she had treated me with absolute superciliousness, and, so far from answering my salutations, had always ignored them.
TheGambler	49	42245	42241	42290	General	"Tell me, [MASK], how am I to do so? On what footing do I stand here?" "Refuse to take her about. Simply leave her alone." "But she would soon find some one else to take my place?"
TheGambler	49	42704	42672	42721	Potapitch	Truly he was cutting a pitiful figure! At this moment three low, respectful knocks sounded at the door; which, on being opened, revealed a chambermaid, with [MASK] behind her come from the Grandmother to request that I should attend her in her rooms.
TheGambler	46	42752	42734	42780	Potapitch	The time was half-past three. "My mistress was unable to sleep," explained [MASK]; "so, after tossing about for a while, she suddenly rose, called for her chair, and sent me to look for you.
TheGambler	53	42805	42800	42853	Madame	True enough, I found [MASK] in the hotel verandah much put about at my delay, for she had been unable to contain herself until four o clock. "Lift me up," she cried to the bearers, and once more we set out for the roulette-salons.
TheGambler	50	44005	43977	44027	Madame	Stake!" I staked, and we lost. "Stake again, stake again eight thousand at a stroke!" "I cannot, [MASK]. The largest stake allowed is four thousand g lden." "Well, then; stake four thousand."
TheGambler	51	44174	44144	44195	Madame	Ah well, I do not mean to rest until I have staked another four thousand." "But you have no money with which to do it, [MASK]. In this satchel I can see only a few five percent bonds and some transfers no actual cash."
TheGambler	57	44347	44292	44349	Madame	I wheeled the chair out of the throng, and, the bearers making their appearance, we left the Casino. "Hurry, hurry!" commanded the Grandmother. "Show me the nearest way to the money-changer s. Is it far?" "A couple of steps, [MASK]."
TheGambler	41	45427	45405	45446	Mlle	Clearly the General was greatly put out at this. Indeed, he was in a perfect agony of vexation. But [MASK]. was careful never to look his way, though he did his best to attract her notice.
TheGambler	43	45479	45450	45493	Mlle	By turns his face blanched and reddened, and he was trembling to such an extent that he could scarcely follow the old lady s play. At length [MASK]. and the Prince took their departure, and the General followed them.
TheGambler	50	46091	46052	46102	Martha	Arrived at the hotel, she called for tea, and then gave orders for her luggage to be packed. "We are off again," she announced. "But whither, Madame?" inquired [MASK]. "What business is that of _yours?_
TheGambler	50	46162	46149	46199	Potapitch	"Fifteen thousand roubles, good mistress? My God!" And [MASK] spat upon his hands probably to show that he was ready to serve her in any way he could. "Now then, you fool! At once you begin with your weeping and wailing!
TheGambler	53	46687	46679	46732	Prascovia	Her face looked grave and careworn. "[MASK]," began the Grandmother, "is what I have just heard through a side wind true namely, that this fool of a stepfather of yours is going to marry that silly whirligig of a Frenchwoman that actress, or something worse?
TheGambler	54	47036	46983	47037	Katerina	Nor, for that matter, do I wish to recall old scores. True, I know that you are a vixen by nature that you are a wasp which will sting one if one touches it yet, my heart is sore for you, for I loved your mother, [MASK].
TheGambler	47	47088	47052	47099	Polina	Otherwise, I do not know what is to become of you, and it is not right that you should continue living with these people. Nay," she interposed, the moment that [MASK] attempted to speak, "I have not yet finished.
TheGambler	48	47172	47146	47194	Polina	Will you come with me or will you not?" "First of all, let me ask of _you_," replied [MASK], "whether you are intending to depart at once?" "What? You suppose me to be jesting?
TheGambler	45	47497	47494	47539	Grandmamma	But if, [MASK], you would take the little ones _and_ myself, then, of course, I could come with you, and would do all I could to serve you" (this she said with great earnestness).
TheGambler	47	47568	47555	47602	Polina	"Do not make a fuss" (as a matter of fact [MASK] never at any time either fussed or wept). "The Great Foster-Father[3] can find for all his chicks a place. You are not coming without the children?
TheGambler	55	47829	47797	47852	Polina	"No," replied the other; "you need not. Do not bother me, for you and all of them have tired me out." Yet when [MASK] tried to kiss the Grandmother s hand, the old lady withdrew it, and herself kissed the girl on the cheek.
TheGambler	53	47922	47906	47959	Madame	Take these five hundred g lden for yourself." "I thank you humbly, [MASK], but I am ashamed to " "Come, come!" cried the Grandmother so energetically, and with such an air of menace, that I did not dare refuse the money further.
TheGambler	51	47998	47996	48047	Potapitch	Now, [MASK], get things ready." I ascended to my room, and lay down upon the bed. A whole hour I must have lain thus, with my head resting upon my hand. So the crisis had come! I needed time for its consideration.
TheGambler	53	48057	48005	48058	Polina	I ascended to my room, and lay down upon the bed. A whole hour I must have lain thus, with my head resting upon my hand. So the crisis had come! I needed time for its consideration. To-morrow I would have a talk with [MASK].
TheGambler	48	48150	48124	48172	Potapitch	Well, he was another problem for me to solve. Suddenly there came a knock at the door, and I opened it to find [MASK] awaiting me. "Sir," he said, "my mistress is asking for you." "Indeed?
TheGambler	48	48335	48306	48354	Madame	For a moment I stood stupefied stood deep in thought; but it was not long before I had made up my mind. "With your leave, [MASK]," I said, "I will not go with you." "And why not?
TheGambler	47	48471	48442	48489	Potapitch	"What folly!" the Grandmother shouted after me. "Very well, then. Do not come, and I will find my way alone. [MASK], you must come with me. Lift up the chair, and carry me along."
TheGambler	52	48516	48501	48553	Potapitch	It was now growing late it was past midnight, but I subsequently learnt from [MASK] how the Grandmother s day had ended. She had lost all the money which, earlier in the day, I had got for her paper securities a sum amounting to about ten thousand roubles.
TheGambler	55	48590	48554	48609	Potapitch	This she did under the direction of the Pole whom, that afternoon, she had dowered with two ten-g lden pieces. But before his arrival on the scene, she had commanded [MASK] to stake for her; until at length she had told him also to go about his business.
TheGambler	48	48900	48852	48900	XIII	Such a garden and flowers as you could never see here, and fresh air and apple-trees coming into blossom, and a beautiful view to look upon. Ah, but what must she do but go travelling abroad? Alack, alack!" [MASK]
TheGambler	55	49058	49019	49074	Polina	But the most curious feature of all is my relation to those events, for hitherto I had never clearly understood myself. Yet now the actual crisis has passed away like a dream. Even my passion for [MASK] is dead. _Was_ it ever so strong and genuine as I thought?
TheGambler	53	49640	49606	49659	Potapitch	All day until eight o clock that evening did she play; and, though I personally did not witness her exploits, I learnt of them later through report. All that day [MASK] remained in attendance upon her; but the Poles who directed her play she changed more than once.
TheGambler	54	50751	50727	50781	Potapitch	Thus the party arrived at the hotel; whence, presently, the gang of rascals was ejected neck and crop. According to [MASK] s calculations, the Grandmother lost, that day, a total of ninety thousand roubles, in addition to the money which she had lost the day before.
TheGambler	55	50987	50953	51008	Polina	In other words, on learning that the old lady had changed her mind about departing, and was bent on setting out for the Casino again, the whole of our gang ([MASK] only excepted) proceeded en masse to her rooms, for the purpose of finally and frankly treating with her.
TheGambler	42	51050	51009	51051	Mlle	But the General, quaking and greatly apprehensive as to his possible future, overdid things. After half an hour s prayers and entreaties, coupled with a full confession of his debts, and even of his passion for [MASK].
TheGambler	44	51382	51370	51414	Mlle	Nor did the Prince himself bow. The rest of the day [MASK]. spent in probing the Prince, and trying to make him declare himself; but in this she made a woeful mistake. The little incident occurred in the evening.
TheGambler	50	51418	51418	51468	Blanche	[MASK] realised that the Prince had not even a copper to his name, but, on the contrary, was minded to borrow of her money wherewith to play at roulette. In high displeasure she drove him from her presence, and shut herself up in her room.
TheGambler	50	51633	51623	51673	Polina	Moreover, I felt reluctant to speak to him of [MASK]; nor, for his part, did he ask me any questions concerning her, although, on my telling him of the Grandmother s exploits, he listened attentively and gravely, and then shrugged his shoulders.
TheGambler	50	51899	51874	51924	Polina	It was bound to have been so. For me to formulate the query which I really wished to put was a simple impossibility. [MASK] spent the whole of that day either in walking about the park with the nurse and children or in sitting in her own room.
TheGambler	51	53321	53321	53372	Blanche	[MASK] had refused to marry him, for the reason that the Grandmother had turned up in place of a telegram, and it was therefore clear that he had no inheritance to look for. Evidently, he supposed that I had hitherto been in entire ignorance of all this.
TheGambler	52	53962	53951	54003	Astley	Clearly he is a good fellow." True enough, [MASK] had come hot-foot on receiving the Grandmother s appeal. Scarcely stopping even to reflect, and with scarcely a word, he counted out the three thousand francs under a note of hand which she duly signed.
TheGambler	43	54466	54424	54467	Mlle	"There is nothing new to report, sir," she replied quietly. Nevertheless I decided to enter, and was just doing so when I halted thunderstruck on the threshold. For before me I beheld the General and [MASK].
TheGambler	55	54543	54489	54544	Mlle	Clearly the General was almost out of his mind with joy, for he was talking all sorts of nonsense, and bubbling over with a long-drawn, nervous laugh a laugh which twisted his face into innumerable wrinkles, and caused his eyes almost to disappear. Afterwards I learnt from [MASK].
TheGambler	50	54698	54698	54748	XIV	[MASK] The shock made me utter an exclamation. "What is the matter? What is the matter?" she asked in a strange voice. She was looking pale, and her eyes were dim. "What is the matter?" I re-echoed.
TheGambler	52	54898	54863	54915	Mademoiselle	Although, at this distance of time, I have forgotten the exact phraseology of the missive, I append, if not the precise words, at all events the general sense. "[MASK]," the document ran, "certain untoward circumstances compel me to depart in haste.
TheGambler	52	55540	55522	55574	Polina	Then an idea suddenly occurred to me. "What about the Grandmother?" I asked. [MASK] looked at me with impatience and bewilderment. "What makes you speak of _her?_" was her irritable inquiry. "I cannot go and live with her.
TheGambler	53	55957	55916	55969	Polina	Although she, an unprotected girl, had come to me in my room in an hotel room and had probably compromised herself thereby, I had not understood! Then a second mad idea flashed into my brain. "[MASK]," I said, "give me but an hour.
TheGambler	45	58978	58978	59023	Polina	[MASK] was still on the sofa, with a lighted candle in front of her, and her hands clasped. As I entered she stared at me in astonishment (for, at the moment, I must have presented a strange spectacle).
TheGambler	47	59121	59105	59152	Polina	I could not withdraw my eyes from it. Consequently, for a moment or two [MASK] escaped my mind. Then I set myself to arrange the pile in order, and to sort the notes, and to mass the gold in a separate heap.
TheGambler	51	59499	59492	59543	Polina	I cried. "Why not, [MASK]?" "Because I am not in the habit of receiving money for nothing." "But I am offering it to you as a _friend_. In the same way I would offer you my very life."
TheGambler	51	60461	60445	60496	Mlle	For instance, he does not blame the General in the matter, but declares that [MASK]. Blanche that love But no; I do not know, I do not know." She stopped suddenly, as though she had said her say, and was feeling bewildered.
TheGambler	52	60514	60463	60515	Grandmamma	Blanche that love But no; I do not know, I do not know." She stopped suddenly, as though she had said her say, and was feeling bewildered. "What poor creatures these people are. How sorry I am for them, and for [MASK]!
TheGambler	49	60672	60667	60716	Polina	Daylight had come, and [MASK] was sitting by my side a strange expression on her face, as though she had seen a vision and was unable to collect her thoughts. She too had just awoken, and was now staring at the money on the table.
TheGambler	45	60729	60700	60745	Polina	She too had just awoken, and was now staring at the money on the table. My head ached; it felt heavy. I attempted to take [MASK] s hand, but she pushed me from her, and leapt from the sofa.
TheGambler	53	60838	60830	60883	Polina	How is it all to end? Suddenly [MASK] rose from the window, approached the table, and, looking at me with an expression of infinite aversion, said with lips which quivered with anger: "Well? Are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs?"
TheGambler	52	60885	60871	60923	Polina	Are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs?" "[MASK], you say that _again, again?_" I exclaimed. "You have changed your mind, then? Ha, ha, ha! You are sorry you ever promised them?"
TheGambler	46	61369	61324	61370	Polina	No, she must have known what she was doing when she brought it. Somehow I contrived to stuff the pile of notes and gold under the bed, to cover them over, and then to leave the room some ten minutes after [MASK].
TheGambler	54	61726	61684	61738	Karl	"Oh, these Russians!" exclaimed the landlord, with an angry toss of the head, while the bystanders laughed and the clerk betook himself to his accounts. Also, every one had learnt about my winnings; [MASK], the corridor lacquey, was the first to congratulate me.
TheGambler	54	61831	61828	61882	Polina	I inquired after [MASK]. "She is ill," he replied, still looking at me with his direct, unwavering glance. "And she is in your rooms." "Yes, she is in my rooms." "Then you are minded to keep her there?"
TheGambler	46	62044	62044	62090	Polina	[MASK] kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there; after which she always smiled." "Indeed? No, I was not there; but I was waiting in the corridor, and walking about the hotel."
TheGambler	55	62480	62472	62527	Polina	Now, although I was honestly sorry for [MASK], it is a fact that, from the moment when, the previous night, I had approached the gaming-table, and begun to rake in the packets of bank-notes, my love for her had entered upon a new plane.
TheGambler	49	62566	62528	62577	Polina	Yes, I can say that now; although, at the time, I was barely conscious of it. Was I, then, at heart a gambler? Did I, after all, love [MASK] not so _very_ much? No, no!
TheGambler	49	62651	62624	62673	Mlle	I was proceeding to the General s rooms when I heard a door near me open, and a voice call me by name. It was [MASK]. s mother, the Widow de Cominges who was inviting me, in her daughter s name, to enter.
TheGambler	52	62704	62653	62705	Mlle	s mother, the Widow de Cominges who was inviting me, in her daughter s name, to enter. I did so; whereupon, I heard a laugh and a little cry proceed from the bedroom (the pair occupied a suite of two apartments), where [MASK].
TheGambler	49	62706	62706	62755	Blanche	[MASK] was just arising. "Ah, c est lui! Viens, donc, b te! Is it true that you have won a mountain of gold and silver? J aimerais mieux l or." "Yes," I replied with a smile.
TheGambler	50	62911	62862	62912	Corneille	"Mon fils, as-tu du c ur?" she cried when she saw me, and then giggled. Her laugh had always been a very cheerful one, and at times it even sounded sincere. "Tout autre " I began, paraphrasing [MASK].
TheGambler	52	63448	63429	63481	Polina	I returned to my own room with my head in a whirl. It was not my fault that [MASK] had thrown a packet in my face, and preferred Mr. Astley to myself. A few bank-notes were still fluttering about the floor, and I picked them up.
TheGambler	54	63848	63813	63867	Hortense	We are going to spend your two hundred thousand francs for you, et tu seras heureux comme un petit roi. I myself will tie your tie for you, and introduce you to [MASK]. And when we have spent your money you shall return here, and break the bank again.
TheGambler	46	64112	64067	64113	Mlle	I spent a little over three weeks there, and, during that time, saw my hundred thousand francs come to an end. I speak only of the _one_ hundred thousand francs, for the other hundred thousand I gave to [MASK].
TheGambler	47	64215	64169	64216	Mlle	"Et les cent mille francs qui nous restent," she added, "tu les mangeras avec moi, mon utchitel." Yes, she always called me her "utchitel." A person more economical, grasping, and mean than [MASK].
TheGambler	47	64614	64607	64654	Blanche	"C est un utchitel," [MASK] would say of me, "qui a gagn deux cent mille francs, and but for me, would have had not a notion how to spend them. Presently he will have to return to his tutoring.
TheGambler	50	64728	64717	64767	Blanche	Indeed, two weeks had not elapsed before I perceived that [MASK] had no real affection for me, even though she dressed me in elegant clothes, and herself tied my tie each day. In short, she utterly despised me. But that caused me no concern.
TheGambler	48	64768	64761	64809	Blas	But that caused me no concern. [MASK] and inert, I spent my evenings generally at the Ch teau des Fleurs, where I would get fuddled and then dance the cancan (which, in that establishment, was a very indecent performance) with clat.
TheGambler	45	65084	65060	65105	Bibi	An example is the way in which she changed her first pair of horses for a pair which cost sixteen thousand francs. "[MASK]," she said on the latter occasion as she approached me, "surely you are not angry?"
TheGambler	50	65305	65305	65355	Blanche	[MASK], who had by no means expected such declarations from me, but, rather, an uproar and protests, was rather taken aback. "Well, well, what a man you are!" she exclaimed. "Mais tu as l esprit pour comprendre.
TheGambler	50	65605	65594	65644	Albert	Did I not see you, the other day, with [MASK] with that black-jowled officer?" "Oh, oh! Mais tu es " "Yes, you are lying right enough. But what makes you suppose that I should be angry? Rubbish!
TheGambler	50	65941	65934	65984	Blanche	Towards the close of the affair, [MASK] grew almost frank with me (at least, she scarcely lied to me at all) declaring, amongst other things, that none of the debts which she had been obliged to incur were going to fall upon my head.
TheGambler	44	66187	66159	66203	Blanche	He came straight to see us, and thenceforward lived with us practically as our guest, though he had a flat of his own as well. [MASK] met him with merry badinage and laughter, and even threw her arms around him.
TheGambler	59	66408	66390	66449	Blanche	On that occasion he had made his appearance nearly shaking with terror, for he had supposed that [MASK] would at once raise an outcry, and have him put from the door; wherefore, he was the more enraptured at the turn that things had taken, and spent the month in a state of senseless ecstasy.
TheGambler	54	66657	66656	66710	Blanche	Only [MASK] could awake him to any semblance of life. His fits of depression and moodiness in corners always meant either that he had not seen her for some while, or that she had gone out without taking him with her, or that she had omitted to caress him before departing.
TheGambler	42	67271	67230	67272	Blanche	Once I had to use actual force to prevent him from buying a phaeton at a price of seven hundred francs, after a vehicle had caught his fancy in the Palais Royal as seeming to be a desirable present for [MASK].
TheGambler	45	67319	67289	67334	Mr.	and the General possessed in the world but a thousand francs! The origin even of those francs I could never determine, but imagined them to have emanated from [MASK] Astley the more so since the latter had paid the family s hotel bill.
TheGambler	57	67605	67559	67616	Blanche	Finally something appeased him, and he was taken out for his walk. More than once, however, I noticed that his depression was growing upon him; that he seemed to be feeling the want of somebody or something; that, despite [MASK] s presence, he was missing some person in particular.
TheGambler	50	67814	67772	67822	Polina	That was when we were taking him to the theatre, and suddenly he exclaimed: "My unfortunate children! Yes, sir, they _are_ unfortunate children." Once, too, when I chanced to mention [MASK], he grew quite bitter against her.
TheGambler	51	67943	67915	67966	Blanche	For months at a time he never left me in my dreams. Do not speak of him again." It was now clear to me that [MASK] and he were on the point of coming to terms; yet, true to my usual custom, I said nothing.
TheGambler	48	67970	67967	68015	Blanche	At length, [MASK] took the initiative in explaining matters. She did so a week before we parted. "Il a de la chance," she prattled, "for the Grandmother is now _really_ ill, and therefore, bound to die.
TheGambler	51	68216	68185	68236	Albert	Besides, I have taken measures to prevent it. You need not be alarmed. That is to say, I have induced him to sign notes of hand in [MASK] s name. Consequently, at any time I could get him punished. Isn t he ridiculous?"
TheGambler	50	68281	68237	68287	Albert	"Very well, then. Marry him." And, in truth, she did so though the marriage was a family one only, and involved no pomp or ceremony. In fact, she invited to the nuptials none but [MASK] and a few other friends.
TheGambler	44	68363	68348	68392	Blanche	"Il est, pourtant, _tr s_ comme il faut," [MASK] remarked when she issued from his room, as though the idea that he was "_tr s_ comme il faut" had impressed even her.
