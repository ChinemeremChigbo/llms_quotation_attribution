TheSunAlsoRises	46	31	30	76	STEIN	--GERTRUDE [MASK] _in conversation_ "One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth forever. . . The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to the place where he arose. . .
TheSunAlsoRises	51	804	801	852	Cohn	By that time [MASK], who had been regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the sole editor. It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority of editing.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	1257	1239	1287	Cohn	We had several _fines_ after the coffee, and I said I must be going. [MASK] had been talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip. He wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	1545	1511	1561	Frances	"It doesn't make any difference. Any girl. I couldn't go, that would be all." "Don't be silly." "You don't know [MASK]. Any girl at all. Didn't you see the way she looked?"
TheSunAlsoRises	47	1649	1626	1673	Jake	"Well, I'll see you to-morrow at the courts," I said. "Good-night, [MASK]," he said, and started back to the caf . "You forgot to get your paper," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	1701	1662	1712	Jake	"You forgot to get your paper," I said. "That's so." He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. "You are not sore, are you, [MASK]?" He turned with the paper in his hand.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	1938	1909	1957	Frances	I am sure he had never been in love in his life. He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college, and [MASK] took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not been everything to his first wife.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	2293	2257	2309	Robert	It was all that was needed to set him off. I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until one day he came into my office. "Hello, [MASK]," I said. "Did you come in to cheer me up?"
TheSunAlsoRises	52	2434	2383	2435	Jake	I had a boat train to catch with a week's mail stories, and only half of them written. "Do you know any dirt?" I asked. "No." "None of your exalted connections getting divorces?" "No; listen, [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	47	2516	2500	2547	Cohn	"All my life I've wanted to go on a trip like that," [MASK] said. He sat down. "I'll be too old before I can ever do it." "Don't be a fool," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	2914	2897	2947	Cohn	Anyway, we went down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda. [MASK] looked at the bottles in bins around the wall. "This is a good place," he said. "There's a lot of liquor," I agreed.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	2951	2936	2984	Jake	"There's a lot of liquor," I agreed. "Listen, [MASK]," he leaned forward on the bar. "Don't you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you're not taking advantage of it?
TheSunAlsoRises	50	3035	3002	3052	Robert	"Yes, every once in a while." "Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we'll be dead?" "What the hell, [MASK]," I said. "What the hell." "I'm serious."
TheSunAlsoRises	42	3108	3105	3147	Robert	"Listen, [MASK], going to another country doesn't make any difference. I've tried all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There's nothing to that."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	3576	3560	3610	Robert	"I can't do it. Nothing will make me do it." "[MASK]," I said, and shook him by the shoulder. He looked up. He smiled and blinked. "Did I talk out loud just then?" "Something.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	3877	3837	3889	Pernod	She went by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat down at the table. The waiter came up. "Well, what will you drink?" I asked. "[MASK]." "That's not good for little girls."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	4361	4314	4362	Georgette	"You oughtn't to drink pernod if you're sick." "You neither." "It doesn't make any difference with me. It doesn't make any difference with a woman." "What are you called?" "[MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	50	4430	4407	4457	Georgette	By this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the _cocher_ to stop. We got out and [MASK] did not like the looks of the place. "This is no great thing of a restaurant." "No," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	4603	4596	4647	Georgette	We had another bottle of wine and [MASK] made a joke. She smiled and showed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses. "You're not a bad type," she said. "It's a shame you're sick. We get on well.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	4724	4678	4725	Barnes	We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been better avoided. I was bored enough. Just then from the other room some one called: "[MASK]!
TheSunAlsoRises	49	4928	4901	4950	Georgette	"Thanks, we'll be in," I said. I went back to the small room. "Who are your friends?" [MASK] asked. "Writers and artists." "There are lots of those on this side of the river."
TheSunAlsoRises	52	5004	4985	5037	Georgette	Come on," I said. "We're going to have coffee with the others." [MASK] opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in the little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lipstick, and straightened her hat.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	5471	5424	5475	Georgette	"I find it dirty." "How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long." "I've been here long enough." "But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that." [MASK] turned to me.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	5652	5621	5667	Braddocks	There were long benches, and tables ran across the room, and at the far end a dancing-floor. "I wish people would come earlier," [MASK] said. The daughter came up and wanted to know what we would drink.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	5729	5709	5760	Georgette	Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor perspiring. "My God," [MASK] said. "What a box to sweat in!" "It's hot." "Hot, my God!" "Take off your hat."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	5772	5769	5819	Georgette	Some one asked [MASK] to dance, and I went over to the bar. It was really very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night. I drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the street.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	5920	5876	5921	Brett	The policeman standing by the door looked at me and smiled. They came in. As they went in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces, grimacing, gesturing, talking. With them was [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	52	6005	6001	6053	Brett	And with them was [MASK]. I was very angry. Somehow they always made me angry. I know they are supposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering composure.
TheSunAlsoRises	43	6108	6093	6136	Georgette	When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd on the floor and [MASK] was dancing with the tall blond youth, who danced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he danced.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	6183	6137	6187	Cohn	As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to dance. She had been taken up by them. I knew then that they would all dance with her. They are like that. I sat down at a table. [MASK] was sitting there.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	6402	6397	6442	Robert	Don't be cross with [MASK]," she said. "He's still only a child, you know." "I wasn't cross," I said. "I just thought perhaps I was going to throw up."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	6503	6500	6551	Jake	Come on, [MASK]," he said, "have a drink." We walked over to the bar. "What's the matter with you? You seem all worked up over something?" "Nothing. This whole show makes me sick is all."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	6552	6514	6565	Brett	" We walked over to the bar. "What's the matter with you? You seem all worked up over something?" "Nothing. This whole show makes me sick is all." [MASK] came up to the bar. "Hello, you chaps."
TheSunAlsoRises	44	6569	6559	6603	Brett	"Hello, you chaps." "Hello, [MASK]," I said. "Why aren't you tight?" "Never going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and soda."
TheSunAlsoRises	44	6656	6645	6689	Brett	But he had that look of eager, deserving expectation. [MASK] was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started all that.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	6724	6685	6735	Brett	She started all that. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you missed none of it with that wool jersey. "It's a fine crowd you're with, [MASK]," I said. "Aren't they lovely?
TheSunAlsoRises	53	6819	6810	6863	Brett	"It's in restraint of trade," [MASK] said. She laughed again. "You're wonderfully sober," I said. "Yes. Aren't I? And when one's with the crowd I'm with, one can drink in such safety, too."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	7078	7074	7124	Georgette	We passed close to [MASK] dancing with another one of them. "What possessed you to bring her?" "I don't know, I just brought her." "You're getting damned romantic." "No, bored." "Now?"
TheSunAlsoRises	53	7188	7140	7193	Brett	She's well taken care of." "Do you want to?" "Would I ask you if I didn't want to?" We left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it on. [MASK] stood by the bar.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	7194	7194	7243	Cohn	[MASK] was talking to her. I stopped at the bar and asked them for an envelope. The patronne found one. I took a fifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and handed it to the patronne.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	7364	7343	7390	Brett	Outside in the street we looked for a taxi. "You're going to lose your fifty francs," [MASK] said. "Oh, yes." "No taxis." "We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	7488	7461	7512	Brett	We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each other. The waiter came and said the taxi was outside. [MASK] pressed my hand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out. "Where should I tell him?"
TheSunAlsoRises	43	7684	7684	7727	Brett	[MASK]'s hat was off. Her head was back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des Gobelins.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	7749	7728	7779	Brett	The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracks by the light of acetylene flares. [MASK]'s face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street was dark again and I kissed her.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	7848	7807	7855	Brett	Her head was down. "Don't touch me," she said. "Please don't touch me." "What's the matter?" "I can't stand it." "Oh, [MASK]." "You mustn't.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	8515	8470	8520	Brett	The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and where you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark. The driver leaned his head around. "Where do you want to go?" I asked. [MASK] turned her head away.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	8628	8599	8650	Brett	"Don't be silly." "Kiss me just once more before we get there." When the taxi stopped I got out and paid. [MASK] came out putting on her hat. She gave me her hand as she stepped down. Her hand was shaky.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	8708	8665	8710	Brett	She pulled her man's felt hat down and started in for the bar. Inside, against the bar and at tables, were most of the crowd who a been at the dance. "Hello, you chaps," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	8901	8900	8947	Barnes	"[MASK]," he said, "have a drink. That girl of yours got in a frightful row." "What about?" "Something the patronne's daughter said. A corking row. She was rather splendid, you know.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	9019	8969	9021	Cohn	"What finally happened?" "Oh, some one took her home. Not a bad-looking girl. Wonderful command of the idiom. Do stay and have a drink." "No," I said. "I must shove off. Seen [MASK]?"
TheSunAlsoRises	51	9081	9060	9111	Brett	"I have to shove off," I said. "Good night." I said good night to [MASK] at the bar. The count was buying champagne. "Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?" he asked. "No.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	9126	9112	9162	Brett	Thanks awfully. I have to go." "Really going?" [MASK] asked. "Yes," I said. "I've got a rotten headache." "I'll see you to-morrow?" "Come in at the office."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	9224	9177	9226	Brett	"Anywhere around five o'clock." "Make it the other side of town then." "Good. I'll be at the Crillon at five." "Try and be there," I said. "Don't worry," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	9359	9357	9405	Ney	I passed [MASK]'s statue standing among the new-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light. There was a faded purple wreath leaning against the base. I stopped and read the inscription: from the Bonapartist Groups, some date; I forget.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	9622	9586	9638	Aloysius	I knew neither the girl nor the man she was marrying. They must be circularizing the town. It was a funny name. I felt sure I could remember anybody with a name like [MASK]. It was a good Catholic name. There was a crest on the announcement.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	10238	10195	10247	Brett	Oh, it was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it. I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn't keep away from it, and I started to think about [MASK] and all the rest of it went away.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	10438	10391	10441	Brett	"There's a species of woman here who's waked the whole street up. What kind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see you. I've told her you're asleep." Then I heard [MASK]'s voice.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	10476	10466	10516	Brett	"Will you send her up, please?" [MASK] came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk. "Silly thing to do," she said. "Make an awful row. I say, you weren't asleep, were you?"
TheSunAlsoRises	48	10561	10532	10580	Brett	What time is it?" I looked at the clock. It was half-past four. "Had no idea what hour it was," [MASK] said. "I say, can a chap sit down? Don't be cross, darling.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	10615	10574	10625	Brett	Don't be cross, darling. Just left the count. He brought me here." "What's he like?" I was getting brandy and soda and glasses. "Just a little," said [MASK]. "Don't try and make me drunk.
TheSunAlsoRises	54	10776	10727	10781	Zizi	He's one of us, though. Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell." She took another drink. "How do I buck on about all this? You don't mind, do you? He's putting up for [MASK], you know."
TheSunAlsoRises	43	10936	10895	10938	Brett	"I say, you are slow on the up-take," she said. I had only sipped my brandy and soda. I took a long drink. "That's better. Very funny," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	11148	11105	11155	Zelli	He's got the car just up the street." "The count?" "Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have breakfast in the Bois. Hampers. Got it all at [MASK]'s. Dozen bottles of Mumms.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	11247	11198	11249	Brett	"Can't do it." "Right. Send him a tender message?" "Anything. Absolutely." "Good night, darling." "Don't be sentimental." "You make me ill." We kissed good night and [MASK] shivered.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	11313	11280	11332	Brett	We kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the concierge muttered something behind her door. I went back up-stairs and from the open window watched [MASK] walking up the street to the big limousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light.
TheSunAlsoRises	43	12005	11998	12041	Krum	"Well, no," said [MASK]. "I can't say I've played any this year. I've tried to get away, but Sundays it's always rained, and the courts are so damned crowded."
TheSunAlsoRises	46	12051	12007	12053	Woolsey	"I can't say I've played any this year. I've tried to get away, but Sundays it's always rained, and the courts are so damned crowded." "The Englishmen all have Saturday off," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	12060	12054	12105	Krum	"Lucky beggars," said [MASK]. "Well, I'll tell you. Some day I'm not going to be working for an agency. Then I'll have plenty of time to get out in the country." "That's the thing to do.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	12168	12118	12170	Krum	"I've been thinking some about getting a car next year." I banged on the glass. The chauffeur stopped. "Here's my street," I said. "Come in and have a drink." "Thanks, old man," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	44	12208	12203	12247	Jake	"You're crazy, [MASK]," he said. "This is on me." "It's all on the office, anyway." "Nope. I want to get it." I waved good-by.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	12248	12214	12263	Krum	"This is on me." "It's all on the office, anyway." "Nope. I want to get it." I waved good-by. [MASK] put his head out. "See you at the lunch on Wednesday."
TheSunAlsoRises	54	12288	12286	12340	Jake	Hello, [MASK]," he said. "Going out to lunch?" "Yes. Let me see if there is anything new." "Where will we eat?" "Anywhere." I was looking over my desk. "Where do you want to eat?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	12344	12304	12354	Wetzel	Let me see if there is anything new." "Where will we eat?" "Anywhere." I was looking over my desk. "Where do you want to eat?" "How about [MASK]'s? They've got good hors d'oeuvres."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	12424	12401	12451	Rotten	" I asked. "No. I don't think so." "How's the writing going?" "[MASK]. I can't get this second book going." "That happens to everybody." "Oh, I'm sure of that.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	12489	12471	12522	Frances	"I mean that." "Well, why don't you start off?" "[MASK]." "Well," I said, "take her with you." "She wouldn't like it. That isn't the sort of thing she likes.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	12685	12656	12707	Cohn	She seems to be absolutely fine and straight." "She's very nice." "I don't know how to describe the quality," [MASK] said. "I suppose it's breeding." "You sound as though you liked her pretty well."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	12853	12810	12860	Ashley	"She was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the war." "She must have been just a kid then." "She's thirty-four now." "When did she marry [MASK]?" "During the war.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	13128	13091	13141	Cohn	"No. Not that. About me going to hell." "Oh, don't go to hell," I said. "Stick around. We're just starting lunch." [MASK] smiled again and sat down. He seemed glad to sit down.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	13164	13142	13189	Jake	What the hell would he have done if he hadn't sat down? "You say such damned insulting things, [MASK]." "I'm sorry. I've got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty things."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	13210	13199	13247	Jake	"You're really about the best friend I have, [MASK]." God help you, I thought. "Forget what I said," I said out loud. "I'm sorry." "It's all right. It's fine.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	13336	13305	13357	Brett	We talked about one thing and another, and I left him to come to the office. CHAPTER 6 At five o'clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for [MASK]. She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters. They were not very good letters
TheSunAlsoRises	49	13770	13747	13796	Harvey	He had a pile of saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave. "Sit down," said [MASK], "I've been looking for you." "What's the matter?" "Nothing. Just looking for you."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	13875	13826	13877	Jake	Absolutely nothing." "What's the matter?" "I don't know. I'm through with them. I'm absolutely through with them." He leaned forward and looked me in the eye. "Do you want to know something, [MASK]?"
TheSunAlsoRises	47	13909	13878	13925	Harvey	"Yes." "I haven't had anything to eat for five days." I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that [MASK] had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.
TheSunAlsoRises	43	13954	13946	13989	Jake	"I tell you it's strange, [MASK]. When I'm like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my own room. I'm like a cat." I felt in my pocket.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	13998	13984	14034	Harvey	I felt in my pocket. "Would a hundred help you any, [MASK]?" "Yes." "Come on. Let's go and eat." "There's no hurry. Have a drink." "Better eat." "No.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	14056	14016	14064	Harvey	"There's no hurry. Have a drink." "Better eat." "No. When I get like this I don't care whether I eat or not." We had a drink. [MASK] added my saucer to his own pile.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	14110	14077	14128	Hoffenheimer	Why?" "What's he like?" "He's all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had dinner with him we talked about [MASK]. 'The trouble is,' he said, 'he's a garter snapper.'
TheSunAlsoRises	48	14149	14129	14177	Harvey	That's not bad." "That's not bad." "He's through now," [MASK] went on. "He's written about all the things he knows, and now he's on all the things he doesn't know."
TheSunAlsoRises	44	14328	14323	14367	Jake	"I was just telling [MASK] here that you're a moron." "What do you mean?" "Tell us right off. Don't think. What would you rather do if you could do anything you wanted?"
TheSunAlsoRises	46	14368	14337	14383	Cohn	"What do you mean?" "Tell us right off. Don't think. What would you rather do if you could do anything you wanted?" [MASK] started to consider. "Don't think. Bring it right out."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	14391	14378	14427	Cohn	Bring it right out." "I don't know," [MASK] said. "What's it all about, anyway?" "I mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No matter how silly it is."
TheSunAlsoRises	53	14435	14404	14457	Cohn	"I mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No matter how silly it is." "I don't know," [MASK] said. "I think I'd rather play football again with what I know about handling myself, now."
TheSunAlsoRises	45	14464	14438	14483	Harvey	"I think I'd rather play football again with what I know about handling myself, now." "I misjudged you," [MASK] said. "You're not a moron. You're only a case of arrested development."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	14589	14539	14590	Harvey	"It would make a difference to you if anybody did it." "No, it wouldn't. That's where you make your big mistake. Because you're not intelligent." "Cut it out about me." "Sure," said [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	51	14614	14591	14642	Harvey	"It doesn't make any difference to me. You don't mean anything to me." "Come on, [MASK]," I said. "Have another porto." "No," he said. "I'm going up the street and eat.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	14647	14626	14679	Jake	"No," he said. "I'm going up the street and eat. See you later, [MASK]." He walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	14688	14658	14707	Cohn	I watched him crossing the street through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic. "He always gets me sore," [MASK] said. "I can't stand him." "I like him," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	14732	14699	14749	Cohn	"I like him," I said. "I'm fond of him. You don't want to get sore at him." "I know it," [MASK] said. "He just gets on my nerves." "Write this afternoon?"
TheSunAlsoRises	46	15023	14981	15027	Lenglen	He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out. He loved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as [MASK], for instance.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	15047	15028	15074	Brett	On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he fell in love with [MASK] his tennis game went all to pieces. People beat him who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it.
TheSunAlsoRises	54	15192	15149	15203	Jake	She was a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and smiled. We watched her cross the street. "Hello," she said, "I'm so glad you're here, [MASK]. I've been wanting to talk to you."
TheSunAlsoRises	52	15248	15228	15280	Cohn--"didn't	She went on, talking rapidly. "I've had the darndest time. This one"--shaking her head at [MASK] come home for lunch." "I wasn't supposed to." "Oh, I know. But you didn't say anything about it to the cook.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	15289	15281	15332	Paula	Then I had a date myself, and [MASK] wasn't at her office. I went to the Ritz and waited for her, and she never came, and of course I didn't have enough money to lunch at the Ritz----" "What did you do?"
TheSunAlsoRises	48	15377	15333	15381	Jake	"Oh, went out, of course." She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful manner. "I always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I ought to know better. How are you, [MASK], anyway?"
TheSunAlsoRises	49	15416	15382	15431	Cohn	"Fine." "That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that Brett one." "Don't you like her?" [MASK] asked. "I think she's perfectly charming. Don't you?"
TheSunAlsoRises	53	15512	15487	15540	Frances	A boy came up with the _Paris Times_, and I bought one and opened it. "What's the matter, [MASK]?" "Oh, nothing," she said, "except that he wants to leave me." "How do you mean?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	16219	16182	16232	Jake	That's what he wants." "Maybe they won't like it. I don't think he's that way. Really." "You don't know him like I do, [MASK]. That's what he wants to do. I know it.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	16303	16274	16325	Cohn	Come on." We got up from the table--they had never brought us a drink--and started across the street toward the Select, where [MASK] sat smiling at us from behind the marble-topped table. "Well, what are you smiling at?"
TheSunAlsoRises	51	16441	16418	16469	Robert	"Isn't that fine!" "Yes, that's the way it's done in the very best families. [MASK]'s sending me. He's going to give me two hundred pounds and then I'm going to visit friends. Won't it be lovely?
TheSunAlsoRises	49	16484	16446	16495	Cohn	He's going to give me two hundred pounds and then I'm going to visit friends. Won't it be lovely? The friends don't know about it, yet." She turned to [MASK] and smiled at him. He was not smiling now.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	16592	16551	16596	Cohn	There are people to whom you could not say insulting things. They give you a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be destroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things. But here was [MASK] taking it all.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	16641	16597	16643	Frances	Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly joking to what went on later. "How can you say such things, [MASK]?"
TheSunAlsoRises	51	16837	16829	16880	Robert	And where are you going to be, [MASK]? It's my own fault, all right. Perfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you'd get rid of me the same way.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	16881	16839	16887	Jake	It's my own fault, all right. Perfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you'd get rid of me the same way. [MASK] doesn't know about that.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	16914	16906	16953	Robert	"Yes, I'll tell him. [MASK] had a little secretary on the magazine. Just the sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was wonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful, too.
TheSunAlsoRises	43	17018	17012	17055	Jake	"You mustn't misunderstand, [MASK], it was absolutely platonic with the secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that she was so nice. And he did that just to please me.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	17090	17038	17091	Robert	It was just that she was so nice. And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn't that literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	52	17110	17106	17158	Robert	Aren't you, [MASK]? That's why he's leaving me. He's decided I don't film well. You see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing on this book, that he doesn't remember anything about us.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	17184	17159	17210	Robert	So now he's going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something frightfully interesting. "Listen, [MASK], dear. Let me tell you something. You won't mind, will you? Don't have scenes with your young ladies.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	17405	17392	17443	Robert	He wasn't a good writer like you are, was he, [MASK]? Do you think he ever had to go and look for material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he wouldn't marry them? I wonder if he cried, too?
TheSunAlsoRises	48	17550	17526	17574	Robert	I'll tell you. It's so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it. Why, you see, [MASK]'s always wanted to have a mistress, and if he doesn't marry me, why, then he's had one.
TheSunAlsoRises	44	17666	17666	17710	Cohn	[MASK] looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there? Why did he keep on taking it like that? As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the window.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	18365	18317	18366	Brett	I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom, undressed and had a shower. I was rubbing down when I heard the door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door. It was [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	49	18390	18374	18423	Brett	He was holding a great bunch of roses. "Hello, darling," said [MASK]. "Aren't you going to let us in?" "Come on. I was just bathing." "Aren't you the fortunate man. Bathing."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	18480	18435	18483	Brett	What will you drink?" "I don't know whether you like flowers, sir," the count said, "but I took the liberty of just bringing these roses." "Here, give them to me." [MASK] took them.
TheSunAlsoRises	43	18508	18495	18538	Brett	I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and [MASK] put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the dining-room table. "I say. We have had a day."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	18678	18638	18689	Brett	"His," she said, and nodded at the count. "I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It was very late." "He's wonderful," [MASK] said. "He remembers everything that's happened."
TheSunAlsoRises	41	18715	18706	18747	Jake	"Who'd want to? I say, [MASK], _do_ we get a drink?" "You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is." "Rather."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	18753	18726	18776	Brett	"You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is." "Rather." While I dressed I heard [MASK] put down glasses and then a siphon, and then heard them talking. I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	18784	18768	18815	Brett	I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt tired and pretty rotten. [MASK] came in the room, a glass in her hand, and sat on the bed. "What's the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?"
TheSunAlsoRises	52	18837	18836	18888	Darling	"[MASK]," she said. Then: "Do you want me to send him away?" "No. He's nice." "I'll send him away." "No, don't." "Yes, I'll send him away."
TheSunAlsoRises	52	18953	18909	18961	Brett	He's mad about me, I tell you." She was gone out of the room. I lay face down on the bed. I was having a bad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen. [MASK] came in and sat on the bed.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	19060	19025	19076	Brett	Is the head any better?" "It's better." "Lie quiet. He's gone to the other side of town." "Couldn't we live together, [MASK]? Couldn't we just live together?" "I don't think so.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	19112	19094	19144	Jake	"I stand it now." "That would be different. It's my fault, [MASK]. It's the way I'm made." "Couldn't we go off in the country for a while?" "It wouldn't be any good.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	19222	19202	19252	Michael	"Let's not talk. Talking's all bilge. I'm going away from you, and then [MASK]'s coming back." "Why are you going away?" "Better for you. Better for me." "When are you going?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	19491	19458	19508	Brett	You know he's extraordinary about buying champagne. It means any amount to him." We went into the dining-room. I took up the brandy bottle and poured [MASK] a drink and one for myself. There was a ring at the bell-pull.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	19553	19509	19555	Brett	I went to the door and there was the count. Behind him was the chauffeur carrying a basket of champagne. "Where should I have him put it, sir?" asked the count. "In the kitchen," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	19562	19556	19605	Henry	"Put it in there, [MASK]," the count motioned. "Now go down and get the ice." He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door. "I think you'll find that's very good wine," he said.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	19655	19606	19657	Brett	"I know we don't get much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this from a friend of mine that's in the business." "Oh, you always have some one in the trade," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	19730	19717	19768	Jake	"We all have titles. Why haven't you a title, [MASK]?" "I assure you, sir," the count put his hand on my arm. "It never does a man any good. Most of the time it costs you money."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	19784	19750	19799	Brett	"It never does a man any good. Most of the time it costs you money." "Oh, I don't know. It's damned useful sometimes," [MASK] said. "I've never known it to do me any good."
TheSunAlsoRises	52	19845	19821	19873	Brett	"Do sit down, count," I said. "Let me take that stick." The count was looking at [MASK] across the table under the gas-light. She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me notice it.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	19878	19874	19923	Jake	"I say, [MASK], I don't want to ruin your rugs. Can't you give a chap an ash-tray?" I found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up with a bucket full of salted ice.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	19931	19889	19937	Henry	Can't you give a chap an ash-tray?" I found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up with a bucket full of salted ice. "Put two bottles in it, [MASK]," the count called.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	19983	19977	20025	Brett	"If you like," [MASK] said. "I couldn't eat a thing." "I always like a good meal," said the count. "Should I bring the wine in, sir?" asked the chauffeur. "Yes.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	20030	19986	20036	Henry	"I couldn't eat a thing." "I always like a good meal," said the count. "Should I bring the wine in, sir?" asked the chauffeur. "Yes. Bring it in, [MASK]," said the count.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	20244	20194	20245	Brett	Awfully decent of you." "I'm not joking you," the count blew a cloud of smoke. "You got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That's all." "Nice of you," said [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	49	20247	20246	20295	Mummy	"[MASK] would be pleased. Couldn't you write it out, and I'll send it in a letter to her." "I'd tell her, too," said the count. "I'm not joking you. I never joke people.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	20317	20271	20319	Brett	"I'd tell her, too," said the count. "I'm not joking you. I never joke people. Joke people and you make enemies. That's what I always say." "You're right," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	20341	20326	20376	Jake	I always joke people and I haven't a friend in the world. Except [MASK] here." "You don't joke him." "That's it." "Do you, now?" asked the count. "Do you joke him?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	20377	20370	20420	Brett	"Do you joke him?" [MASK] looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes. "No," she said. "I wouldn't joke him." "See," said the count. "You don't joke him."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	20432	20405	20456	Brett	"See," said the count. "You don't joke him." "This is a hell of a dull talk," [MASK] said. "How about some of that champagne?" The count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	20496	20473	20525	Jake	Why don't you just talk?" "I've talked too ruddy much. I've talked myself all out to [MASK]." "I should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you never finish your sentences at all."
TheSunAlsoRises	53	20585	20534	20587	Brett	Let any one finish them as they like." "It is a very interesting system," the count reached down and gave the bottles a twirl. "Still I would like to hear you talk some time." "Isn't he a fool?" [MASK] asked.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	20671	20622	20673	Brett	"I like to drink champagne from magnums. The wine is better but it would have been too hard to cool." He held the bottle, looking at it. I put out the glasses. "I say. You might open it," [MASK] suggested.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	20700	20687	20734	Brett	It was amazing champagne. "I say that is wine," [MASK] held up her glass. "We ought to toast something. 'Here's to royalty.'" "This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear.
TheSunAlsoRises	54	20755	20706	20760	Brett	"We ought to toast something. 'Here's to royalty.'" "This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. You don't want to mix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste." [MASK]'s glass was empty.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	20810	20799	20847	Brett	"Let's enjoy a little more of this," [MASK] pushed her glass forward. The count poured very carefully. "There, my dear. Now you enjoy that slowly, and then you can get drunk." "Drunk? Drunk?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	20947	20905	20955	Brett	"You haven't been around much, have you?" "Yes, my dear. I have been around very much. I have been around a very great deal." "Drink your wine," said [MASK]. "We've all been around.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	21014	20995	21043	Brett	I have seen a lot, too." "Of course you have, my dear," [MASK] said. "I was only ragging." "I have been in seven wars and four revolutions," the count said. "Soldiering?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	21044	21017	21067	Brett	"I was only ragging." "I have been in seven wars and four revolutions," the count said. "Soldiering?" [MASK] asked. "Sometimes, my dear. And I have got arrow wounds. Have you ever seen arrow wounds?"
TheSunAlsoRises	49	21220	21202	21251	Brett	When I was twenty-one years old." "What were you doing?" asked [MASK]. "Were you in the army?" "I was on a business trip, my dear." "I told you he was one of us.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	21257	21242	21291	Brett	"I told you he was one of us. Didn't I?" [MASK] turned to me. "I love you, count. You're a darling." "You make me very happy, my dear. But it isn't true."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	21374	21333	21384	Brett	"Yes. Absolutely." "I know," said the count. "That is the secret. You must get to know the values." "Doesn't anything ever happen to your values?" [MASK] asked. "No. Not any more."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	21526	21524	21574	Brett	So was [MASK]. It was a good party. "Where would you like to go?" asked the count after dinner. We were the only people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over against the door. They wanted to go home.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	21585	21575	21625	Brett	"We might go up on the hill," [MASK] said. "Haven't we had a splendid party?" The count was beaming. He was very happy. "You are very nice people," he said. He was smoking a cigar again.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	21658	21651	21702	Brett	"We have our careers," [MASK] said. "Come on. Let's get out of this." "Have another brandy," the count said. "Get it on the hill." "No. Have it here where it is quiet."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	21711	21661	21712	Brett	"Come on. Let's get out of this." "Have another brandy," the count said. "Get it on the hill." "No. Have it here where it is quiet." "You and your quiet," said [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	44	21749	21713	21757	Brett	"What is it men feel about quiet?" "We like it," said the count. "Like you like noise, my dear." "All right," said [MASK]. "Let's have one."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	21759	21751	21799	Sommelier	"Let's have one." "[MASK]!" the count called. "Yes, sir." "What is the oldest brandy you have?" "Eighteen eleven, sir." "Bring us a bottle." "I say.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	21809	21762	21811	Jake	the count called. "Yes, sir." "What is the oldest brandy you have?" "Eighteen eleven, sir." "Bring us a bottle." "I say. Don't be ostentatious. Call him off, [MASK]."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	21944	21927	21975	Brett	He was all teeth and lips. "He's a great friend of mine," [MASK] said. "Damn good drummer." The music stopped and we started toward the table where the count sat. Then the music started again and we danced.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	22004	21976	22022	Brett	I looked at the count. He was sitting at the table smoking a cigar. The music stopped again. "Let's go over." [MASK] started toward the table. The music started and again we danced, tight in the crowd.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	22082	22064	22114	Brett	"I'm damned fond of him." "I'm going to marry him," [MASK] said. "Funny. I haven't thought about him for a week." "Don't you write him?" "Not I. Never write letters."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	22160	22125	22173	Michael	"Rather. Damned good letters, too." "When are you going to get married?" "How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. [MASK]'s trying to get his mother to put up for it."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	22188	22188	22237	Michael	[MASK]'s people have loads of money." The music stopped. We walked over to the table. The count stood up. "Very nice," he said. "You looked very, very nice." "Don't you dance, count?
TheSunAlsoRises	48	22259	22213	22261	Brett	"Very nice," he said. "You looked very, very nice." "Don't you dance, count?" I asked. "No. I'm too old." "Oh, come off it," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	41	22288	22262	22303	Brett	"My dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you dance." "Splendid," [MASK] said. "I'll dance again for you some time. I say.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	22310	22291	22341	Zizi	"I'll dance again for you some time. I say. What about your little friend, [MASK]?" "Let me tell you. I support that boy, but I don't want to have him around." "He is rather hard."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	22365	22364	22413	Jake	"[MASK]'s rather the same way." "He gives me the willys." "Well," the count shrugged his shoulders. "About his future you can't ever tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father."
TheSunAlsoRises	52	22423	22373	22425	Brett	"He gives me the willys." "Well," the count shrugged his shoulders. "About his future you can't ever tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father." "Come on. Let's dance," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	22441	22426	22473	Brett	We danced. It was crowded and close. "Oh, darling," [MASK] said, "I'm so miserable." I had that feeling of going through something that has all happened before. "You were happy a minute ago."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	22584	22535	22585	Brett	I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated, something I had been through and that now I must go through again. ". . . . . ." the drummer sang softly. "Let's go," said [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	50	22724	22724	22774	Brett	[MASK] came over with her wrap on. She kissed the count and put her hand on his shoulder to keep him from standing up. As we went out the door I looked back and there were three girls at his table. We got into the big car.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	22775	22768	22818	Brett	We got into the big car. [MASK] gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel. "No, don't come up," she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door was unlatched. "Really?" "No. Please."
TheSunAlsoRises	52	22823	22785	22837	Brett	"No, don't come up," she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door was unlatched. "Really?" "No. Please." "Good night, [MASK]," I said. "I'm sorry you feel rotten."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	22842	22829	22879	Jake	"I'm sorry you feel rotten." "Good night, [MASK]. Good night, darling. I won't see you again." We kissed standing at the door. She pushed me away. We kissed again. "Oh, don't!"
TheSunAlsoRises	47	22880	22844	22891	Brett	Good night, darling. I won't see you again." We kissed standing at the door. She pushed me away. We kissed again. "Oh, don't!" [MASK] said. She turned quickly and went into the hotel.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	23450	23420	23467	Jake	Not so good. It seemed better than it was." "How do you mean?" I was getting glasses and a siphon. "Tight, [MASK]. I was tight." "That's strange. Better have a drink."
TheSunAlsoRises	46	23468	23452	23498	Bill	I was tight." "That's strange. Better have a drink." [MASK] rubbed his forehead. "Remarkable thing," he said. "Don't know how it happened. Suddenly it happened." "Last long?"
TheSunAlsoRises	49	23503	23473	23522	Jake	"Remarkable thing," he said. "Don't know how it happened. Suddenly it happened." "Last long?" "Four days, [MASK]. Lasted just four days." "Where did you go?" "Don't remember.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	23590	23541	23592	Bill	"Not so sure. Possible." "Go on. Tell me about it." "Can't remember. Tell you anything I could remember." "Go on. Take that drink and remember." "Might remember a little," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	23705	23684	23734	Nigger	Then local white boy hit him. Then he knocked white boy cold. Then everybody commenced to throw chairs. [MASK] went home with us in our car. Couldn't get his clothes. Wore my coat. Remember the whole thing now. Big sporting evening."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	23831	23786	23835	Jake	"You're right. Wasn't me at all. Was another fellow. Think we called him the local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music." "How'd you come out?" "Not so good, [MASK]. Injustice everywhere.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	23918	23888	23938	Jake	That white boy musta ruptured himself swinging at me. I never did hit him.'" "Did you get any money?" "No money, [MASK]. All we could get was nigger's clothes. Somebody took his watch, too. Splendid nigger.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	24025	23975	24026	Bill	Married. Got a family. Going to write me a letter and send me the money I loaned him. Wonderful nigger. Hope I gave him the right address." "You probably did." "Well, anyway, let's eat," said [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	41	24159	24147	24188	Bill	We went on. "Here's a taxidermist's," [MASK] said. "Want to buy anything? Nice stuffed dog?" "Come on," I said. "You're pie-eyed."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	24196	24162	24211	Bill	"Want to buy anything? Nice stuffed dog?" "Come on," I said. "You're pie-eyed." "Pretty nice stuffed dogs," [MASK] said. "Certainly brighten up your flat." "Come on."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	24230	24207	24255	Jake	"Come on." "Just one stuffed dog. I can take 'em or leave 'em alone. But listen, [MASK]. Just one stuffed dog." "Come on." "Mean everything in the world to you after you bought it.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	24358	24309	24360	Bill	We went on. "How'd you feel that way about dogs so sudden?" "Always felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed animals." We stopped and had a drink. "Certainly like to drink," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	24370	24361	24414	Jake	"You ought to try it some times, [MASK]." "You're about a hundred and forty-four ahead of me." "Ought not to daunt you. Never be daunted. Secret of my success. Never been daunted. Never been daunted in public."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	24428	24388	24436	George	"Ought not to daunt you. Never be daunted. Secret of my success. Never been daunted. Never been daunted in public." "Where were you drinking?" "Stopped at the Crillon. [MASK] made me a couple of Jack Roses.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	24437	24437	24484	George	[MASK]'s a great man. Know the secret of his success? Never been daunted." "You'll be daunted after about three more pernods." "Not in public. If I begin to feel daunted I'll go off by myself.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	24547	24515	24566	Splendid	Hadn't eaten for three days. Doesn't eat any more. Just goes off like a cat. Pretty sad." "He's all right." "[MASK]. Wish he wouldn't keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me nervous."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	24627	24584	24632	Nix	Only let's not get daunted. Suppose they got any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we wouldn't have to go all the way down to the island to eat." "[MASK]," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	24651	24633	24679	Bill	"We're going to have a regular meal." "Just a suggestion," said [MASK]. "Want to start now?" "Come on." We started on again down the Boulevard. A horse-cab passed us.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	24680	24654	24704	Bill	Want to start now?" "Come on." We started on again down the Boulevard. A horse-cab passed us. [MASK] looked at it. "See that horse-cab? Going to have that horse-cab stuffed for you for Christmas.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	24751	24705	24752	Brett	Going to give all my friends stuffed animals. I'm a nature-writer." A taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop. The taxi backed up to the curb. In it was [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	51	24807	24794	24845	Michael	"I say I'm just back. Haven't bathed even. [MASK] comes in to-night." "Good. Come on and eat with us, and we'll all go to meet him." "Must clean myself." "Oh, rot!
TheSunAlsoRises	50	25285	25270	25320	Brett	"And besides all the animals were dead." "One more," [MASK] said, "and I must run. Do send the waiter for a taxi." "There's a line of them. Right out in front." "Good."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	25327	25294	25345	Brett	Do send the waiter for a taxi." "There's a line of them. Right out in front." "Good." We had the drink and put [MASK] into her taxi. "Mind you're at the Select around ten. Make him come.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	25405	25389	25437	Bill	"The man she's going to marry." "Well, well," [MASK] said. "That's always just the stage I meet anybody. What'll I send them? Think they'd like a couple of stuffed race-horses?"
TheSunAlsoRises	45	25448	25408	25453	Lady	"That's always just the stage I meet anybody. What'll I send them? Think they'd like a couple of stuffed race-horses?" "We better eat." "Is she really [MASK] something or other?"
TheSunAlsoRises	48	25598	25587	25635	Bill	"Doesn't get us a table, though," [MASK] said. "Grand woman, though." We had a good meal, a roast chicken, new green beans, mashed potatoes, a salad, and some apple-pie and cheese.
TheSunAlsoRises	55	25822	25806	25861	Bill	"They're going to cut a street through." "They would," [MASK] said. We walked on and circled the island. The river was dark and a bateau mouche went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out of sight under the bridge.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	26164	26120	26173	Bill	There was an iron pot of stew. The girl ladled some onto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in one hand. "Want to have a drink?" "No," said [MASK]. "I don't need it."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	26394	26380	26430	Mike	How are you, old lad?" "You look very fit, [MASK]." "Oh, I am. I'm frightfully fit. I've done nothing but walk. Walk all day long. One drink a day with my mother at tea."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	26523	26492	26541	Mike	Did you see my nose?" There was a patch of dried blood on the bridge of his nose. "An old lady's bags did that," [MASK] said. "I reached up to help her with them and they fell on me."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	26754	26729	26779	Brett	"What did he say?" "Bought me a drink. I thought I might as well take it. I say, [MASK], you _are_ a lovely piece. Don't you think she's beautiful?" "Beautiful. With this nose?
TheSunAlsoRises	42	26947	26913	26955	Brett	"I'd like to see it, rather"--he was making an effort to pull himself together--"but I can't go. I had a date with this thing here. I say, [MASK], do get a new hat."
TheSunAlsoRises	43	27178	27173	27216	Bill	"Well," said [MASK]. "You can't blame him such a hell of a lot." CHAPTER 9 The Ledoux-Kid Francis fight was the night of the 20th of June. It was a good fight.
TheSunAlsoRises	43	27254	27234	27277	Hendaye	He was having a very quiet time, he said, bathing, playing some golf and much bridge. [MASK] had a splendid beach, but he was anxious to start on the fishing-trip. When would I be down?
TheSunAlsoRises	49	27478	27478	27527	Brett	[MASK]'s mad to go. You're sure we wouldn't just be a bloody nuisance?" "Don't talk like a fool." "I'm a little tight, you know. I wouldn't ask you like this if I weren't.
TheSunAlsoRises	55	27592	27549	27604	Bill	"How can the man say he'd mind now? I'll ask him later." "But you don't mind, do you?" "Don't ask that again unless you want to make me sore. [MASK] and I go down on the morning of the 25th."
TheSunAlsoRises	54	27687	27687	27741	Brett	[MASK] can't get up in the morning." "Indeed not!" "If our money comes and you're sure you don't mind." "It will come, all right. I'll see to that." "Tell me what tackle to send for."
TheSunAlsoRises	52	27766	27717	27769	Brett	"It will come, all right. I'll see to that." "Tell me what tackle to send for." "Get two or three rods with reels, and lines, and some flies." "I won't fish," [MASK] put in.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	27857	27819	27868	Mike	We _will_ have fun." "The 25th. When is that?" "Saturday." "We _will_ have to get ready." "I say," said [MASK], "I'm going to the barber's."
TheSunAlsoRises	53	27906	27895	27948	Mike	"We _have_ got the loveliest hotel," [MASK] said. "I think it's a brothel!" "We left our bags here at the Dingo when we got in, and they asked us at this hotel if we wanted a room for the afternoon only.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	27972	27949	27997	Mike	Seemed frightfully pleased we were going to stay all night." "_I_ believe it's a brothel," [MASK] said. "And _I_ should know." "Oh, shut it and go and get your hair cut."
TheSunAlsoRises	45	28316	28281	28326	Brett	"Tell him you're coming. He can always not come." "I'll write him and give him a chance to pull out of it." I did not see [MASK] again until the night of the 24th of June.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	28332	28327	28380	Cohn	"Did you hear from [MASK]?" "Rather. He's keen about it." "My God!" "I thought it was rather odd myself." "Says he can't wait to see me." "Does he think you're coming alone?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	28394	28360	28410	Michael	"Says he can't wait to see me." "Does he think you're coming alone?" "No. I told him we were all coming down together. [MASK] and all." "He's wonderful." "Isn't he?"
TheSunAlsoRises	51	28495	28484	28535	Bill	I wrote out an itinerary so they could follow us. [MASK] and I took the morning train from the Gare d'Orsay. It was a lovely day, not too hot, and the country was beautiful from the start. We went back into the diner and had breakfast.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	28624	28588	28639	Bill	"They're all reserved," the dining-car conductor said. "There will be a fifth service at three-thirty." "This is serious," I said to [MASK]. "Give him ten francs." "Here," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	54	28709	28661	28715	Bill	"Thank you," he said. "I would advise you gentlemen to get some sandwiches. All the places for the first four services were reserved at the office of the company." "You'll go a long way, brother," [MASK] said to him in English.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	28751	28716	28763	Bill	"I suppose if I'd given you five francs you would have advised us to jump off the train." "_Comment?_" "Go to hell!" said [MASK]. "Get the sandwiches made and a bottle of wine.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	28768	28764	28813	Jake	You tell him, [MASK]." "And send it up to the next car." I described where we were. In our compartment were a man and his wife and their young son. "I suppose you're Americans, aren't you?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	28830	28781	28831	Bill	" I described where we were. In our compartment were a man and his wife and their young son. "I suppose you're Americans, aren't you?" the man asked. "Having a good trip?" "Wonderful," said [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	49	29203	29184	29233	Bill	It's a wonder they ever find any one to marry them." "Say," said [MASK], "do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?" "How do you mean?
TheSunAlsoRises	49	29611	29592	29641	Bill	"But it's dangerous when it's rough." "Did you get a meal?" [MASK] asked. "We sure did. We set right there when they started to come in, and they must have just thought we were in the party.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	29741	29701	29749	Bill	You could get a meal, then, all right." "I am," I said. "That's what makes me so sore." Finally at a quarter past four we had lunch. [MASK] had been rather difficult at the last.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	29771	29750	29796	Protestants	He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with one of the returning streams of pilgrims. "When do us [MASK] get a chance to eat, father?" "I don't know anything about it. Haven't you got tickets?"
TheSunAlsoRises	49	30216	30189	30238	Bill	"I've got a cab." He was a little near-sighted. I had never noticed it before. He was looking at [MASK], trying to make him out. He was shy, too. "We'll go up to my hotel.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	30326	30320	30370	Jake	Did you get my line, [MASK]?" The cab stopped in front of the hotel and we all got out and went in. It was a nice hotel, and the people at the desk were very cheerful, and we each had a good small room.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	30547	30532	30581	Cohn	We went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral. [MASK] made some remark about it being a very good example of something or other, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	30870	30843	30890	Bill	While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. I pointed him out to [MASK] and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just come in from the garden.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	30899	30899	30946	Cohn	[MASK] came down, finally, and we all went out to the car. It was a big, closed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs, and we had him put the back of the car down.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	31277	31245	31296	Bill	The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the car and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any trout. [MASK] tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it did not go very well.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	32557	32545	32594	Bill	Fifty pesetas." "I'll remember it myself," [MASK] said. I saw he was angry and wanted to smooth him down. "It's a sure thing they'll come," I said. "But maybe not to-night."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	32603	32572	32621	Cohn	"It's a sure thing they'll come," I said. "But maybe not to-night." "Want to call it off?" [MASK] asked. "No. Why should I? Make it a hundred if you like."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	32664	32632	32682	Cohn	"That's enough," I said. "Or you'll have to make a book and give me some of it." "I'm satisfied," [MASK] said. He smiled. "You'll probably win it back at bridge, anyway."
TheSunAlsoRises	44	32692	32667	32711	Bill	He smiled. "You'll probably win it back at bridge, anyway." "You haven't got it yet," [MASK] said. We went out to walk around under the arcade to the Caf Iru a for coffee.
TheSunAlsoRises	55	32727	32723	32778	Bill	"Say," [MASK] said to me, "have I got any chance on that bet?" "You've got a rotten chance. They've never been on time anywhere. If their money doesn't come it's a cinch they won't get in to-night."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	34070	34056	34105	Bill	Can you bet on bull-fights?" "You could," [MASK] said, "but you don't need to." "It would be like betting on the war," I said. "You don't need any economic interest."
TheSunAlsoRises	53	34567	34532	34585	Jake	He came up to the table and sat down in one of the wicker chairs. "This is a comfortable caf ," he said. "Did you have a good night, [MASK]?" "I slept like a log." "I didn't sleep very well.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	34586	34578	34629	Bill	"I didn't sleep very well. [MASK] and I were out late, too." "Where were you?" "Here. And after it shut we went over to that other caf . The old man there speaks German and English." "The Caf
TheSunAlsoRises	50	34699	34676	34726	Bill	By the way, I got the bus tickets." "I'm not going up to-day. You and [MASK] go on ahead." "I've got your ticket." "Give it to me. I'll get the money back."
TheSunAlsoRises	54	34851	34843	34897	Brett	"Well, I wrote suggesting it to [MASK]." "Why in hell didn't you stay there and meet them then?" I started to say, but I stopped. I thought that idea would come to him by itself, but I do not believe it ever did.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	34926	34878	34927	Brett	I thought that idea would come to him by itself, but I do not believe it ever did. He was being confidential now and it was giving him pleasure to be able to talk with the understanding that I knew there was something between him and [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	49	34931	34928	34977	Bill	"Well, [MASK] and I will go up right after lunch," I said. "I wish I could go. We've been looking forward to this fishing all winter." He was being sentimental about it. "But I ought to stay.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	34999	34952	35001	Bill	We've been looking forward to this fishing all winter." He was being sentimental about it. "But I ought to stay. I really ought. As soon as they come I'll bring them right up." "Let's find [MASK]."
TheSunAlsoRises	52	35086	35073	35125	Bill	"The lying bastard!" "Oh, no," said [MASK]. "Don't get sore. Don't get sore at this stage of the trip. How did you ever happen to know this fellow, anyway?" "Don't rub it in."
TheSunAlsoRises	53	35126	35094	35147	Bill	Don't get sore at this stage of the trip. How did you ever happen to know this fellow, anyway?" "Don't rub it in." [MASK] looked around, half-shaved, and then went on talking into the mirror while he lathered his face.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	35290	35265	35315	Bill	"I know it. That's the terrible part." I laughed. "Yes. Go on and laugh," said [MASK]. "You weren't out with him last night until two o'clock." "Was he very bad?" "Awful.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	35323	35306	35353	Brett	"Was he very bad?" "Awful. What's all this about him and [MASK], anyway? Did she ever have anything to do with him?" He raised his chin up and pulled it from side to side. "Sure.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	35858	35827	35880	Robert	Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top, and the women all had their fans going in the sun. It certainly was hot. [MASK] climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	35933	35926	35972	Bill	He offered the wine-skin to [MASK] and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	36063	36041	36088	Bill	The man waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch. When [MASK] offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	36291	36276	36326	Bill	"Pretty nice, eh?" "These Basques are swell people," [MASK] said. The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle-leather. He wore a black smock like all the rest. There were wrinkles in his tanned neck.
TheSunAlsoRises	44	36337	36294	36338	Bill	The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle-leather. He wore a black smock like all the rest. There were wrinkles in his tanned neck. He turned around and offered his wine-bag to [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	50	36394	36385	36435	Bill	he said. "Lift it up." [MASK] raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into his mouth, his head tipped back. When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	36925	36889	36935	Bill	The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under the big tarpaulins and lifted down. [MASK] and I got down and went into the posada.
TheSunAlsoRises	42	37935	37913	37955	Bill	"Where?" "Way off there where the mountain starts." "It's cold up here," [MASK] said. "It's high," I said. "It must be twelve hundred metres."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	38309	38273	38321	Bill	It had a stone floor, low ceiling, and was oak-panelled. The shutters were up and it was so cold you could see your breath. "My God!" said [MASK]. "It can't be this cold to-morrow.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	38352	38311	38359	Bill	"It can't be this cold to-morrow. I'm not going to wade a stream in this weather." There was an upright piano in the far corner of the room beyond the wooden tables and [MASK] went over and started to play.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	38543	38512	38562	Bill	"Is the wine included?" "Oh, yes." "Well," I said. "It's all right." I went back to [MASK]. He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was, and went on playing.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	38627	38579	38631	Bill	There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of pheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks. The panels were all dark and smoky-looking. There was a cupboard full of liqueur bottles. I looked at them all. [MASK] was still playing.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	38691	38691	38740	Bill	[MASK] came over from the piano and we drank the hot punch and listened to the wind. "There isn't too much rum in that." I went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a half-tumblerful into the pitcher.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	38747	38709	38754	Bill	"There isn't too much rum in that." I went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a half-tumblerful into the pitcher. "Direct action," said [MASK]. "It beats legislation."
TheSunAlsoRises	43	38775	38749	38792	Bill	"It beats legislation." The girl came in and laid the table for supper. "It blows like hell up here," [MASK] said. The girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	39206	39168	39217	Bill	The goats watched me dig. When I went back into the inn the woman was down in the kitchen, and I asked her to get coffee for us, and that we wanted a lunch. [MASK] was awake and sitting on the edge of the bed.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	39263	39249	39299	Splendid	"You lazy bum!" "Been working for the common good? [MASK]. I want you to do that every morning." "Come on," I said. "Get up." "What? Get up? I never get up."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	39348	39300	39350	Bill	He climbed into bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin. "Try and argue me into getting up." I went on looking for the tackle and putting it all together in the tackle-bag. "Aren't you interested?" [MASK] asked.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	39424	39386	39436	Bill	Now you're reasonable. You go out and dig some more worms and I'll be right down." "Oh, go to hell!" "Work for the good of all." [MASK] stepped into his underclothes. "Show irony and pity."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	39507	39487	39537	Bill	I thumbed my nose. "That's not irony." As I went down-stairs I heard [MASK] singing, "Irony and Pity. When you're feeling . . . Oh, Give them Irony and Give them Pity. Oh, give them Irony.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	39683	39650	39700	Bill	The girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was bread toasted and buttered. "Ask her if she's got any jam," [MASK] said. "Be ironical with her." "Have you got any jam?"
TheSunAlsoRises	49	39754	39707	39756	Bill	I wish I could talk Spanish." The coffee was good and we drank it out of big bowls. The girl brought in a glass dish of raspberry jam. "Thank you." "Hey! that's not the way," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	39846	39834	39884	Cohn	"Not so bad. That's better. Now why is [MASK] pitiful? Be ironic." He took a big gulp of coffee. "Aw, hell!" I said. "It's too early in the morning." "There you go.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	40045	40045	40097	Caffeine	[MASK] puts a man on her horse and a woman in his grave. You know what's the trouble with you? You're an expatriate. One of the worst type. Haven't you heard that? Nobody that ever left their own country ever wrote anything worth printing.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	40231	40182	40233	Bill	"When do I work?" "You don't work. One group claims women support you. Another group claims you're impotent." "No," I said. "I just had an accident." "Never mention that," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	40261	40248	40298	Henry	That's what you ought to work up into a mystery. Like [MASK]'s bicycle." He had been going splendidly, but he stopped. I was afraid he thought he had hurt me with that crack about being impotent. I wanted to start him again.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	40385	40351	40401	Bill	"But you don't pedal it." "No," I said, "I guess you don't pedal it." "Let's lay off that," [MASK] said. "All right. I was just standing up for the tricycle."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	40414	40388	40438	Bill	"All right. I was just standing up for the tricycle." "I think he's a good writer, too," [MASK] said. "And you're a hell of a good guy. Anybody ever tell you you were a good guy?"
TheSunAlsoRises	46	40594	40558	40604	Bill	He stopped. "Want to hear some more?" "Shoot," I said. "I don't know any more. Tell you some more at lunch." "Old [MASK]," I said. "You bum!"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	40770	40742	40792	Burguete	In the flat pool beside the stream tadpoles spotted the sand. We went up a steep bank and across the rolling fields. Looking back we saw [MASK], white houses and red roofs, and the white road with a truck going along it and the dust rising.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	40946	40940	40988	Bill	"This is country," [MASK] said. The road went up a hill and we got into thick woods, and the road kept on climbing. Sometimes it dipped down but rose again steeply. All the time we heard the cattle in the woods.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	41147	41110	41158	Bill	"We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley," I pointed out to [MASK]. "That's a hell of a hike."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	41317	41299	41347	Bill	It was very hot and we stopped under some trees beside a dam that crossed the river. [MASK] put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods, put on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	41383	41363	41414	McGintys	"It's full of them." "I'm going to fish a fly. You got any [MASK]?" "There's some in there." "You going to fish bait?" "Yeah. I'm going to fish the dam here."
TheSunAlsoRises	52	41462	41415	41467	Bill	"Well, I'll take the fly-book, then." He tied on a fly. "Where'd I better go? Up or down?" "Down is the best. They're plenty up above, too." [MASK] went down the bank.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	41499	41484	41534	Bill	If they won't take a fly I'll just flick it around." [MASK] was down below watching the stream. "Say," he called up against the noise of the dam. "How about putting the wine in that spring up the road?"
TheSunAlsoRises	48	41543	41535	41583	Bill	"All right," I shouted. [MASK] waved his hand and started down the stream. I found the two wine-bottles in the pack, and carried them up the road to where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	42118	42079	42130	Bill	It was very hot on the dam, so I put my worm-can in the shade with the bag, and got a book out of the pack and settled down under the tree to read until [MASK] should come up for lunch. It was a little past noon
TheSunAlsoRises	50	42284	42278	42328	Bill	What did you get?" [MASK] sat down, opened up his bag, laid a big trout on the grass. He took out three more, each one a little bigger than the last, and laid them side by side in the shade from the tree.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	42414	42389	42438	Bill	"I wish I were." "Get them all on worms?" "Yes." "You lazy bum!" [MASK] put the trout in the bag and started for the river, swinging the open bag. He was wet from the waist down
TheSunAlsoRises	51	42503	42464	42515	Bill	They were cold. Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back to the trees. I spread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked one of the bottles and leaned the other against a tree. [MASK] came up drying his hands, his bag plump with ferns.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	42576	42527	42578	Bill	He pulled the cork, and tipped up the bottle and drank. "Whew! That makes my eyes ache." "Let's try it." The wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty. "That's not such filthy wine," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	42735	42730	42776	Bill	"Oh," said [MASK], sucking the drumstick, "how should we know? We should not question. Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks." "Eat an egg."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	42777	42752	42801	Bill	Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks." "Eat an egg." [MASK] gestured with the drumstick in one hand and the bottle of wine in the other. "Let us rejoice in our blessings.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	42836	42829	42880	Bill	"After you, brother." [MASK] took a long drink. "Utilize a little, brother," he handed me the bottle. "Let us not doubt, brother. Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hen-coop with simian fingers.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	42994	42978	43028	Mencken	Let us kneel and say: 'Don't eat that, Lady--that's [MASK].'" "Here," I said. "Utilize a little of this." We uncorked the other bottle. "What's the matter?" I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	43160	43153	43203	Bill	"It's the humidity," [MASK] said. "They ought to take this damn humidity away." "Have another shot." "Is this all we've got?" "Only the two bottles." "Do you know what you are?
TheSunAlsoRises	48	43205	43163	43211	Bill	"They ought to take this damn humidity away." "Have another shot." "Is this all we've got?" "Only the two bottles." "Do you know what you are?" [MASK] looked at the bottle affectionately.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	43297	43273	43321	Bill	"Well," I said, "the saloon must go." "You're right there, old classmate," [MASK] said. "The saloon must go, and I will take it with me." "You're cock-eyed.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	43378	43349	43399	Bill	"All right." We lay with our heads in the shade and looked up into the trees. "You asleep?" "No," [MASK] said. "I was thinking." I shut my eyes. It felt good lying on the ground.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	43404	43381	43430	Bill	"I was thinking." I shut my eyes. It felt good lying on the ground. "Say," [MASK] said, "what about this Brett business?" "What about it?" "Were you ever in love with her?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	43460	43441	43491	Bill	"Off and on for a hell of a long time." "Oh, hell!" [MASK] said. "I'm sorry, fella." "It's all right," I said. "I don't give a damn any more."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	43541	43492	43543	Bill	"Really?" "Really. Only I'd a hell of a lot rather not talk about it." "You aren't sore I asked you?" "Why the hell should I be?" "I'm going to sleep," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	43555	43552	43601	Jake	"Listen, [MASK]," he said, "are you really a Catholic?" "Technically." "What does that mean?" "I don't know." "All right, I'll go to sleep now," he said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	43625	43580	43630	Bill	"I don't know." "All right, I'll go to sleep now," he said. "Don't keep me awake by talking so much." I went to sleep, too. When I woke up [MASK] was packing the rucksack.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	43671	43631	43682	Bill	It was late in the afternoon and the shadow from the trees was long and went out over the dam. I was stiff from sleeping on the ground. "What did you do? Wake up?" [MASK] asked. "Why didn't you spend the night?
TheSunAlsoRises	54	43699	43674	43728	Bill	"Why didn't you spend the night?" I stretched and rubbed my eyes. "I had a lovely dream," [MASK] said. "I don't remember what it was about, but it was a lovely dream." "I don't think I dreamt."
TheSunAlsoRises	46	43736	43702	43748	Bill	"I don't remember what it was about, but it was a lovely dream." "I don't think I dreamt." "You ought to dream," [MASK] said. "All our biggest business men have been dreamers.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	43820	43815	43865	Bill	"Well," said [MASK], "have we got everything?" "The worms." "Your worms. Put them in there." He had the pack on his back and I put the worm-cans in one of the outside flap pockets.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	44098	44085	44132	Harris	CHAPTER 13 One morning I went down to breakfast and the Englishman, [MASK], was already at the table. He was reading the paper through spectacles. He looked up and smiled. "Good morning," he said. "Letter for you.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	44164	44120	44170	Harris	"Good morning," he said. "Letter for you. I stopped at the post and they gave it me with mine." The letter was at my place at the table, leaning against a coffee-cup. [MASK] was reading the paper again.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	44326	44314	44366	Harris	"What day of the week is it?" I asked [MASK]. "Wednesday, I think. Yes, quite. Wednesday. Wonderful how one loses track of the days up here in the mountains." "Yes. We've been here nearly a week."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	44584	44557	44606	Bill	Be a good chap." "We really have to get into town," I said. "What a pity." After breakfast [MASK] and I were sitting warming in the sun on a bench out in front of the inn and talking it over.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	44714	44709	44760	Cohn	"What does the word [MASK] mean?" he asked. "What a lousy telegram!" I said. "He could send ten words for the same price. 'I come Thursday.' That gives you a lot of dope, doesn't it?"
TheSunAlsoRises	47	44773	44728	44775	Cohn	I said. "He could send ten words for the same price. 'I come Thursday.' That gives you a lot of dope, doesn't it?" "It gives you all the dope that's of interest to [MASK]."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	44821	44807	44856	Bill	Should we answer it?" "We might as well," said [MASK]. "There's no need for us to be snooty." We walked up to the post-office and asked for a telegraph blank. "What will we say?"
TheSunAlsoRises	49	44857	44823	44872	Bill	"There's no need for us to be snooty." We walked up to the post-office and asked for a telegraph blank. "What will we say?" [MASK] asked. "'Arriving to-night.' That's enough."
TheSunAlsoRises	46	44953	44943	44989	Harris	"It's a remarkable place, though," [MASK] said. "I wouldn't not have seen it. I'd been intending coming up each day." "It isn't the same as fishing, though, is it?"
TheSunAlsoRises	41	45027	44997	45038	Harris	"I say not." We were standing in front of the old chapel of the monastery. "Isn't that a pub across the way?" [MASK] asked. "Or do my eyes deceive me?"
TheSunAlsoRises	51	45096	45088	45139	Harris	We had a bottle of wine apiece. [MASK] would not let us pay. He talked Spanish quite well, and the innkeeper would not take our money. "I say. You don't know what it's meant to me to have you chaps up here."
TheSunAlsoRises	47	45198	45157	45204	Harris	"I say. Really you don't know how much it means. I've not had much fun since the war." "We'll fish together again, some time. Don't you forget it, [MASK]." "We must.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	45285	45252	45302	Bill	"I wish you'd let me pay for it. It _does_ give me pleasure, you know." "This is going to give me pleasure," [MASK] said. The innkeeper brought in the fourth bottle. We had kept the same glasses.
TheSunAlsoRises	43	45533	45522	45565	Harris--	He tied all his own flies. "I say, [MASK]" I began. "No, no!" he said. He was climbing down from the bus. "They're not first-rate flies at all.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	45592	45555	45604	Harris	"They're not first-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it might remind you of what a good time we had." The bus started. [MASK] stood in front of the post-office. He waved.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	45906	45869	45917	Montoya	"Yes. All the rooms we looked at." "Where are our friends now?" "I think they went to the pelota." "And how about the bulls?" [MASK] smiled. "To-night," he said.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	45960	45960	46011	Montoya	[MASK] put his hand on my shoulder. "I'll see you there." He smiled again. He always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very special secret between the two of us; a rather shocking but really very deep secret that we knew about.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	46088	46088	46137	Montoya	[MASK] politely disbelieved. "But he's not aficionado like you." He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly. "Yes," I said. "He's a real aficionado." "But he's not aficionado like you are."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	46138	46093	46141	Aficion	But he's not aficionado like you." He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly. "Yes," I said. "He's a real aficionado." "But he's not aficionado like you are." [MASK] means passion.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	46163	46142	46192	Montoya	An aficionado is one who is passionate about the bull-fights. All the good bull-fighters stayed at [MASK]'s hotel; that is, those with aficion stayed there. The commercial bull-fighters stayed once, perhaps, and then did not come back.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	46270	46253	46300	Montoya	They often had the most flattering inscriptions. But they did not mean anything. One day [MASK] took them all out and dropped them in the waste-basket. He did not want them around. We often talked about bulls and bull-fighters.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	46377	46357	46405	Montoya	These men were aficionados. Those who were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was full. [MASK] introduced me to some of them. They were always very polite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an American.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	46525	46525	46574	Montoya	[MASK] could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion. He could forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all sorts of lapses. For one who had aficion he could forgive anything. At once he forgave me all my friends.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	46602	46602	46653	Bill	[MASK] had gone up-stairs as we came in, and I found him washing and changing in his room. "Well," he said, "talk a lot of Spanish?" "He was telling me about the bulls coming in to-night."
TheSunAlsoRises	44	47125	47091	47135	Bill	"We'd have gotten here earlier if you hadn't come." "You'd never have gotten here." "What rot! You chaps are brown. Look at [MASK]." "Did you get good fishing?"
TheSunAlsoRises	48	47165	47139	47187	Cohn	"We wanted to join you." "It wasn't bad. We missed you." "I wanted to come," [MASK] said, "but I thought I ought to bring them." "You bring us. What rot."
TheSunAlsoRises	42	47195	47179	47221	Mike	"You bring us. What rot." "Was it really good?" [MASK] asked. "Did you take many?" "Some days we took a dozen apiece. There was an Englishman up there."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	47391	47361	47411	Brett	"Tell them about your medals." "I'll not. That story reflects great discredit on me." "What story's that?" "[MASK] will tell you. She tells all the stories that reflect discredit on me." "Go on.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	47438	47423	47473	Mike	"I'll tell it myself." "What medals have you got, [MASK]?" "I haven't got any medals." "You must have some." "I suppose I've the usual medals. But I never sent in for them.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	47757	47723	47769	Brett	He stopped for us to laugh. "Is that all?" "That's all. Perhaps I didn't tell it right." "You didn't," said [MASK]. "But no matter." We were all laughing.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	47777	47765	47814	Mike	We were all laughing. "Ah, yes," said [MASK]. "I know now. It was a damn dull dinner, and I couldn't stick it, so I left. Later on in the evening I found the box in my pocket.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	47893	47853	47905	Brett	Gave one to each girl. Form of souvenir. They thought I was hell's own shakes of a soldier. Give away medals in a night club. Dashing fellow." "Tell the rest," [MASK] said. "Don't you think that was funny?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	47906	47896	47946	Mike	"Don't you think that was funny?" [MASK] asked. We were all laughing. "It was. I swear it was. Any rate, my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals back. Sent a man around. Kept on writing for months.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	47970	47923	47972	Mike	Any rate, my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals back. Sent a man around. Kept on writing for months. Seems some chap had left them to be cleaned. Frightfully military cove. Set hell's own store by them." [MASK] paused.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	48023	48009	48060	Mike	"Frightfully good tailor. Never believe it to see me now," [MASK] said. "I used to pay him a hundred pounds a year just to keep him quiet. So he wouldn't send me any bills. Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	48085	48043	48090	Bill	So he wouldn't send me any bills. Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt. It was right after the medals. Gave his letters rather a bitter tone." "How did you go bankrupt?" [MASK] asked. "Two ways
TheSunAlsoRises	45	48232	48226	48271	Mike	"I will not," [MASK] said. "My learned counsel was blind, too. I say this is a gloomy subject. Are we going down and see these bulls unloaded or not?" "Let's go down."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	48430	48417	48468	Brett	"That's where we'll go when funds get low," [MASK] said. The woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we passed. She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the window and stared.
TheSunAlsoRises	41	48473	48433	48474	Brett	The woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we passed. She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the window and stared. They were staring at [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	49	48790	48752	48801	Brett	Above the walls there were heads in the windows of the houses. At the far end of the plateau boys had climbed into the trees. "They must think something is going to happen," [MASK] said. "They want to see the bulls."
TheSunAlsoRises	52	48966	48958	49010	Brett	"They don't look happy," [MASK] said. The men on top of the wall leaned back and pulled up the door of the corral. Then they pulled up the door of the cage. I leaned way over the wall and tried to see into the cage.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	49865	49825	49876	Bill	"They all know each other," I said. "They're only dangerous when they're alone, or only two or three of them together." "What do you mean, dangerous?" [MASK] said. "They all looked dangerous to me."
TheSunAlsoRises	46	49921	49877	49923	Bill	"They only want to kill when they're alone. Of course, if you went in there you'd probably detach one of them from the herd, and he'd be dangerous." "That's too complicated," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	50131	50115	50167	Mike	Do say something. Don't just sit there." "I said something, [MASK]. Don't you remember? About the steers." "Oh, say something more. Say something funny. Can't you see we're all having a good time here?"
TheSunAlsoRises	41	50173	50133	50174	Michael	Don't you remember? About the steers." "Oh, say something more. Say something funny. Can't you see we're all having a good time here?" "Come off it, [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	50	50520	50472	50522	Mike	You can't blame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to. They wouldn't do it. You can't blame them, now. Can you? Now, answer me. Can you blame them?" "Go to hell, [MASK]."
TheSunAlsoRises	46	50702	50680	50726	Mike	"I'm not saying he's not right, you know." She turned to me. The emotion left [MASK]'s voice. We were all friends together. "I'm not so damn drunk as I sounded," he said.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	50735	50712	50761	Brett	"I'm not so damn drunk as I sounded," he said. "I know you're not," [MASK] said. "We're none of us sober," I said. "I didn't say anything I didn't mean."
TheSunAlsoRises	43	50771	50738	50781	Brett	"We're none of us sober," I said. "I didn't say anything I didn't mean." "But you put it so badly," [MASK] laughed. "He was an ass, though.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	50971	50939	50989	Mike	I wouldn't read them." "You wouldn't read any letters, darling. You wouldn't read mine." "I can't read letters," [MASK] said. "Funny, isn't it?" "You can't read anything."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	51021	50974	51023	Brett	"Funny, isn't it?" "You can't read anything." "No. You're wrong there. I read quite a bit. I read when I'm at home." "You'll be writing next," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	51028	51024	51076	Michael	"Come on, [MASK]. Do buck up. You've got to go through with this thing now. He's here. Don't spoil the fiesta." "Well, let him behave, then." "He'll behave. I'll tell him."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	51082	51034	51083	Jake	You've got to go through with this thing now. He's here. Don't spoil the fiesta." "Well, let him behave, then." "He'll behave. I'll tell him." "You tell him, [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	48	51159	51126	51174	Jake	That is perfect, you know." "Oh, no. I can't." "Go on. We're all friends. Aren't we all friends, [MASK]?" "I can't tell him. It's too ridiculous."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	51239	51206	51257	Brett	"He claims she turns men into swine. Damn good. I wish I were one of these literary chaps." "He'd be good, you know," [MASK] said. "He writes a good letter." "I know," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	42	51273	51267	51309	Brett	"That was nothing," [MASK] said. "He can write a damned amusing letter." "She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill." "I damned well was, too."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	51332	51286	51334	Cohn	"She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill." "I damned well was, too." "Come on," I said, "we must go in and eat." "How should I meet [MASK]?"
TheSunAlsoRises	47	51358	51348	51395	Mike	"It's quite all right with me," [MASK] said. "I'm not embarrassed." "If he says anything, just say you were tight." "Quite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	51401	51361	51411	Brett	"I'm not embarrassed." "If he says anything, just say you were tight." "Quite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight." "Come on," [MASK] said. "Are these poisonous things paid for?
TheSunAlsoRises	49	51467	51419	51468	Montoya	We walked across the square. It was dark and all around the square were the lights from the caf s under the arcades. We walked across the gravel under the trees to the hotel. They went up-stairs and I stopped to speak with [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	49	51579	51538	51587	Montoya	"I know what you mean." "They're all right." "Yes. They're all right." "How did your friends like them?" "Fine." "Good," [MASK] said. I went up-stairs.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	51636	51636	51686	Mike	[MASK] was awful. He's terrible when he's tight." "He wasn't so tight." "The hell he wasn't. I know what we had before we came to the caf ." "He sobered up afterward." "Good.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	51782	51760	51809	Mike	"When does the fiesta start?" "Day after to-morrow." "We've got to keep [MASK] from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is terrible." "We'd better get cleaned up for supper." "Yes.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	51836	51796	51844	Brett	"We'd better get cleaned up for supper." "Yes. That will be a pleasant meal." "Won't it?" As a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal. [MASK] wore a black, sleeveless evening dress.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	51896	51890	51942	Brett	He could not stop looking at [MASK]. It seemed to make him happy. It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so lovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it. They could not take that away from him.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	51943	51898	51947	Bill	It seemed to make him happy. It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so lovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it. They could not take that away from him. [MASK] was very funny.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	51950	51948	52001	Michael	So was [MASK]. They were good together. It was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening. Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	52198	52198	52251	Mike	[MASK] was already in bed. He had come in with me an hour before. He woke as she came in, and they talked together. I heard them laugh. I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep. It was not necessary to read any more.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	52371	52337	52386	Brett	Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been having [MASK] for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	52694	52688	52738	Cohn	I liked to see him hurt [MASK]. I wished he would not do it, though, because afterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality. That was a large statement.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	52757	52715	52763	Brett	That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality. That was a large statement. What a lot of bilge I could think up at night. What rot, I could hear [MASK] say it. What rot!
TheSunAlsoRises	53	53515	53484	53537	Brett	We all had a vermouth at the caf . It was a quiet life and no one was drunk. I went to church a couple of times, once with [MASK]. She said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but I told her that not only was it impossible
TheSunAlsoRises	54	53667	53627	53681	Cohn	It had rained a little in the night and it was fresh and cool on the plateau, and there was a wonderful view. We all felt good and we felt healthy, and I felt quite friendly to [MASK]. You could not be upset about anything on a day like that.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	54067	54066	54119	Jerez	"[MASK]," I said to the waiter. Before the waiter brought the sherry the rocket that announced the fiesta went up in the square. It burst and there was a gray ball of smoke high up above the Theatre Gayarre, across on the other side of the plaza.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	54602	54593	54641	Cohn	"I'll go and get them," [MASK] said. "Bring them here." The fiesta was really started. It kept up day and night for seven days. The dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	54839	54805	54857	Moors	All we could see of the procession through the closely pressed people that crowded all the side streets and curbs were the great giants, cigar-store Indians, thirty feet high, [MASK], a King and Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the _riau-riau_.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	54928	54909	54958	Brett	We started inside and there was a smell of incense and people filing back into the church, but [MASK] was stopped just inside the door because she had no hat, so we went out again and along the street that ran back from the chapel into town.
TheSunAlsoRises	44	54987	54959	55003	Brett	The street was lined on both sides with people keeping their place at the curb for the return of the procession. Some dancers formed a circle around [MASK] and started to dance. They wore big wreaths of white garlics around their necks.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	55031	55031	55080	Brett	[MASK] wanted to dance but they did not want her to. They wanted her as an image to dance around. When the song ended with the sharp _riau-riau!_ they rushed us into a wine-shop. We stood at the counter.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	55083	55043	55090	Brett	They wanted her as an image to dance around. When the song ended with the sharp _riau-riau!_ they rushed us into a wine-shop. We stood at the counter. They had [MASK] seated on a wine-cask.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	55155	55121	55170	Bill	I put down money for the wine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket. "I want a leather wine-bottle," [MASK] said. "There's a place down the street," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	54	55202	55171	55225	Brett	"I'll go get a couple." The dancers did not want me to go out. Three of them were sitting on the high wine-cask beside [MASK], teaching her to drink out of the wine-skins. They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck.
TheSunAlsoRises	42	55251	55242	55284	Bill	Singing it into his ear. Beating time on [MASK]'s back. I explained to them that I would be back. Outside in the street I went down the street looking for the shop that made leather wine-bottles.
TheSunAlsoRises	44	55757	55757	55801	Mike	[MASK] was sitting at a table with several men in their shirt-sleeves, eating from a bowl of tuna fish, chopped onions and vinegar. They were all drinking wine and mopping up the oil and vinegar with pieces of bread.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	55850	55813	55858	Mike	"Come here. I want you to meet my friends. We're all having an hors-d'oeuvre." I was introduced to the people at the table. They supplied their names to [MASK] and sent for a fork for me.
TheSunAlsoRises	43	55972	55931	55974	Mike	Every one took a drink, tipping the wine-skin at arm's length. Outside, above the singing, we could hear the music of the procession going by. "Isn't that the procession?" [MASK] asked.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	56161	56143	56192	Arriba	"No," I said. "No, thanks!" "Yes. Yes. [MASK]! Up with the bottle!" I took a drink. It tasted of licorice and warmed all the way. I could feel it warming in my stomach.
TheSunAlsoRises	41	56208	56201	56242	Mike	"I don't know," [MASK] said. "I'll ask. Where is the drunken comrade?" he asked in Spanish. "You want to see him?" "Yes," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	56249	56216	56267	Mike	Where is the drunken comrade?" he asked in Spanish. "You want to see him?" "Yes," I said. "Not me," said [MASK]. "This gent." The Anis del Mono man wiped his mouth and stood up.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	56349	56298	56351	Cohn	They had covered him with a coat and another coat was folded under his head. Around his neck and on his chest was a big wreath of twisted garlics. "Let him sleep," the man whispered. "He's all right." Two hours later [MASK] appeared.
TheSunAlsoRises	41	56516	56512	56553	Brett	"Let's translate [MASK] to the hotel." We said good-bye to many people and shook hands with many people and went out. Outside it was dark. "What time is it do you suppose?
TheSunAlsoRises	50	56583	56569	56619	Cohn	"You've been asleep two days." "No," said [MASK], "what time is it?" "It's ten o'clock." "What a lot we've drunk." "You mean what a lot _we've_ drunk.
TheSunAlsoRises	57	56780	56748	56805	Cohn	The others stayed up. My own room was locked and I could not find the key, so I went up-stairs and slept on one of the beds in [MASK]'s room. The fiesta was going on outside in the night, but I was too sleepy for it to keep me awake.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	56867	56833	56883	Cohn	They would race through the streets and out to the bull-ring. I had been sleeping heavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of [MASK]'s and went out on the balcony. Down below the narrow street was empty.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	57092	57083	57134	Cohn	Back in bed, I went to sleep. [MASK] woke me when he came in. He started to undress and went over and closed the window because the people on the balcony of the house just across the street were looking in. "Did you see the show?
TheSunAlsoRises	51	57177	57148	57199	Brett	"Anybody get hurt?" "One of the bulls got into the crowd in the ring and tossed six or eight people." "How did [MASK] like it?" "It was all so sudden there wasn't any time for it to bother anybody."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	57264	57218	57266	Cohn	We went to your room but it was locked." "Where did you stay up?" "We danced at some club." "I got sleepy," I said. "My gosh! I'm sleepy now," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	57317	57311	57362	Grand	How was it?" "[MASK]." "Where you going?" "To sleep." No one was up before noon. We ate at tables set out under the arcade. The town was full of people. We had to wait for a table.
TheSunAlsoRises	58	57617	57593	57651	Brett	"You think so?" "Don't look at the horses, after the bull hits them," I said to [MASK]. "Watch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, but then don't look again until the horse is dead if it's been hit."
TheSunAlsoRises	45	57662	57619	57664	Brett	"Watch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, but then don't look again until the horse is dead if it's been hit." "I'm a little nervy about it," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	57733	57683	57735	Mike	"You'll be all right. There's nothing but that horse part that will bother you, and they're only in for a few minutes with each bull. Just don't watch when it's bad." "She'll be all right," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	57755	57736	57785	Bill	"I'll look after her." "I don't think you'll be bored," [MASK] said. "I'm going over to the hotel to get the glasses and the wine-skin," I said. "See you back here.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	57801	57758	57803	Bill	"I'm going over to the hotel to get the glasses and the wine-skin," I said. "See you back here. Don't get cock-eyed." "I'll come along," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	57910	57861	57911	Montoya	"We'll watch him with the glasses," I said. "Oh, to hell with him!" "He spends a lot of time there." "I want him to stay there." In the hotel on the stairs we met [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	49	57980	57968	58017	Montoya	"He's getting dressed for the bull-fight." [MASK] knocked on the door and opened it. It was a gloomy room with a little light coming in from the window on the narrow street. There were two beds separated by a monastic partition.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	58120	58120	58171	Romero	[MASK] listened very seriously. Then he turned to me. He was the best-looking boy I have ever seen. "You go to the bull-fight," he said in English. "You know English," I said, feeling like an idiot.
TheSunAlsoRises	56	58329	58288	58344	Montoya	He was standing, straight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with the hangers-on as we shut the door. "He's a fine boy, don't you think so?" [MASK] asked. "He's a good-looking kid," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	58383	58371	58419	Montoya	"We'll see how he is in the ring," [MASK] said. We found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my room, took it and the field-glasses, locked the door, and went down-stairs.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	58502	58462	58511	Romero	This was a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. Of the other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable. But there was no comparison with [MASK], although neither of his bulls was much.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	58777	58728	58779	Bill	Finally, we got out of the crowd and made for the caf . The waiter saved chairs for the others, and we each ordered an absinthe and watched the crowd in the square and the dancers. "What do you suppose that dance is?" [MASK] asked.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	58798	58789	58836	Bill	"They're not all the same," [MASK] said. "They dance differently to all the different tunes." "It's swell dancing." In front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were dancing.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	58912	58878	58928	Bill	The balls of the feet touched. Then the music broke wildly and the step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street. "Here come the gentry," [MASK] said. They were crossing the street "Hello, men," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	58988	58980	59032	Brett	"And those green trousers." "[MASK] never took her eyes off them." "I say, I must borrow your glasses to-morrow." "How did it go?" "Wonderfully! Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle!"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	59061	59021	59071	Mike	Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle!" "How about the horses?" "I couldn't help looking at them." "She couldn't take her eyes off them," [MASK] said. "She's an extraordinary wench."
TheSunAlsoRises	41	59085	59064	59105	Brett	"She's an extraordinary wench." "They do have some rather awful things happen to them," [MASK] said. "I couldn't look away, though." "Did you feel all right?"
TheSunAlsoRises	46	59208	59200	59246	Mike	"He didn't look bored," [MASK] said. "I thought he was going to be sick." "I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute." "I thought he was going to be sick.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	59255	59211	59257	Robert	"I thought he was going to be sick." "I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute." "I thought he was going to be sick. You weren't bored, were you, [MASK]?"
TheSunAlsoRises	43	59523	59500	59543	Brett	"After a while you never notice anything disgusting." "It is a bit strong just at the start," [MASK] said. "There's a dreadful moment for me just when the bull starts for the horse."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	59606	59600	59650	Brett	"They are something," [MASK] said. "That Romero lad is just a child." "He's a damned good-looking boy," I said. "When we were up in his room I never saw a better-looking kid."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	59958	59958	60007	Romero	[MASK] never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and natural in line. The others twisted themselves like corkscrews, their elbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns had passed, to give a faked look of danger.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	60022	60008	60055	Romero	Afterward, all that was faked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling. [MASK]'s bull-fighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time.
TheSunAlsoRises	42	60096	60088	60130	Joselito	I told her how since the death of [MASK] all the bull-fighters had been developing a technic that simulated this appearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while the bull-fighter was really safe.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	60207	60186	60238	Mike	"You won't until he gets frightened," I said. "He'll never be frightened," [MASK] said. "He knows too damned much." "He knew everything when he started. The others can't ever learn what he was born with."
TheSunAlsoRises	43	60288	60274	60317	Jake	"I wouldn't be surprised." "Be a good chap, [MASK]. Don't tell her anything more about him. Tell her how they beat their old mothers." "Tell me what drunks they are."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	60448	60441	60491	Romero	She leaned forward on the barrera. [MASK] waved his picadors to their places, then stood, his cape against his chest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out. After it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	61027	60979	61029	Montoya	"Yes," I said. "Everybody knows the American ambassador." "He's here in town, now." "Yes," I said. "Everybody's seen them." "I've seen them, too," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	61085	61049	61099	Montoya	"Let me send for a drink." "No, I have to go." I finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with cold water. [MASK] was standing there looking more embarrassed. "Look," he said.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	61251	61221	61269	Montoya	"I wanted to ask you because you were an American," he said. "That's what I'd do." "Look," said [MASK]. "People take a boy like that. They don't know what he's worth.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	61411	61388	61440	Montoya	All you have to do is not give him the message." "He's such a fine boy," said [MASK]. "He ought to stay with his own people. He shouldn't mix in that stuff." "Won't you have a drink?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	61449	61432	61482	Montoya	"Won't you have a drink?" I asked. "No," said [MASK], "I have to go." He went out. I went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the arcades around the square.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	61758	61736	61782	Romero	I met the friend, a Madrid bull-fight critic, a little man with a drawn face. I told [MASK] how much I liked his work, and he was very pleased. We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French.
TheSunAlsoRises	41	61801	61772	61813	Romero	We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French. I reached to our table for my wine-bottle, but the critic took my arm. [MASK] laughed. "Drink here," he said in English.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	62047	62015	62062	Romero	His older brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in this hotel. He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked for [MASK]. He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	62421	62388	62437	Romero	"Very nice," I said. "About twenty-six arrobas. Very short horns. Haven't you seen them?" "Oh, yes," said [MASK]. "They won't weigh twenty-six arrobas," said the critic.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	62466	62445	62492	Romero	"They've got bananas for horns," the critic said. "You call them bananas?" asked [MASK]. He turned to me and smiled. "_You_ wouldn't call them bananas?" "No," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	62647	62642	62694	Romero	They both stood up. [MASK]'s face was very brown. He had very nice manners. I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was not enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to have coffee.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	62695	62654	62705	Mike	He had very nice manners. I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was not enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to have coffee. [MASK] ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for everybody.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	62900	62867	62920	Mike	"Nothing." "Is that why he drinks?" "No. He's waiting to marry this lady." "Tell him bulls have no balls!" [MASK] shouted, very drunk, from the other end of the table. "What does he say?"
TheSunAlsoRises	47	62971	62935	62982	Brett	Tell him bulls have no balls!" "You understand?" I said. "Yes." I was sure he didn't, so it was all right. "Tell him [MASK] wants to see him put on those green pants."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	63324	63300	63349	Mike	Why do you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?" "Oh, shut up, [MASK]! Nobody interrupted you." "No, I'd like to get this settled." He turned away from me. "
TheSunAlsoRises	52	63358	63326	63378	Cohn	Nobody interrupted you." "No, I'd like to get this settled." He turned away from me. "Do you think you amount to something, [MASK]? Do you think you belong here among us? People who are out to have a good time?
TheSunAlsoRises	42	63443	63414	63456	Mike	Do you think you add to the party? Why don't you say something?" "I said all I had to say the other night, [MASK]." "I'm not one of you literary chaps."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	63594	63594	63642	Cohn	[MASK] still sat at the table. His face had the sallow, yellow look it got when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it. The childish, drunken heroics of it. It was his affair with a lady of title.
TheSunAlsoRises	44	63751	63719	63763	Mike	He stood waiting, his face sallow, his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready to do battle for his lady love. I grabbed [MASK]. "Come on to the caf ," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	41	64239	64232	64273	Brett	"How you know things," [MASK] said. Inside, the caf was crowded and very noisy. No one noticed us come in. We could not find a table. There was a great noise going on.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	64286	64242	64288	Bill	Inside, the caf was crowded and very noisy. No one noticed us come in. We could not find a table. There was a great noise going on. "Come on, let's get out of here," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	64374	64355	64401	Mike	The other girl had a headache and had gone to bed. "Here's the pub," [MASK] said. It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar where you could get food and where they danced in the back room.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	64414	64377	64427	Fundador	It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar where you could get food and where they danced in the back room. We all sat down at a table and ordered a bottle of [MASK]. The bar was not full. There was nothing going on.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	64585	64572	64619	Michael	"When did you come here?" "Come off it, [MASK]." "I say, she _is_ a lovely girl. Where have I been? Where have I been looking all this while? You're a lovely thing.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	64631	64588	64641	Bill	"I say, she _is_ a lovely girl. Where have I been? Where have I been looking all this while? You're a lovely thing. _Have_ we met? Come along with me and [MASK]. We're going to festa the English."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	64802	64796	64847	Cohn	"I didn't," [MASK] said. "I thought I'd sit here because I felt a little tight." "What a hell of a reason for sitting with any one. If you're tight, go to bed. Go on to bed."
TheSunAlsoRises	54	64857	64805	64859	Brett	"I thought I'd sit here because I felt a little tight." "What a hell of a reason for sitting with any one. If you're tight, go to bed. Go on to bed." "Was I rude enough to him?" [MASK] asked.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	64860	64860	64905	Cohn	[MASK] was gone. "My God! I'm so sick of him!" "He doesn't add much to the gayety." "He depresses me so." "He's behaved very badly." "Damned badly.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	64979	64931	64980	Michael	He would. You know I do know how he feels. He can't believe it didn't mean anything." "I know." "Nobody else would behave as badly. Oh, I'm so sick of the whole thing. And [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	48	64996	64989	65037	Mike	"It's been damned hard on [MASK]." "Yes. But he didn't need to be a swine." "Everybody behaves badly," I said. "Give them the proper chance." "You wouldn't behave badly."
TheSunAlsoRises	43	65038	64999	65042	Brett	"Yes. But he didn't need to be a swine." "Everybody behaves badly," I said. "Give them the proper chance." "You wouldn't behave badly." [MASK] looked at me.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	65052	65043	65088	Cohn	"I'd be as big an ass as [MASK]," I said. "Darling, don't let's talk a lot of rot." "All right. Talk about anything you like." "Don't be difficult.
TheSunAlsoRises	56	65112	65058	65114	Mike	"Darling, don't let's talk a lot of rot." "All right. Talk about anything you like." "Don't be difficult. You're the only person I've got, and I feel rather awful to-night." "You've got [MASK]."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	65175	65162	65210	Brett	Please don't make me feel any worse than I do." [MASK] was nervous as I had never seen her before. She kept looking away from me and looking ahead at the wall. "Want to go for a walk?" "Yes.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	65239	65199	65248	Brett	"Want to go for a walk?" "Yes. Come on." I corked up the Fundador bottle and gave it to the bartender. "Let's have one more drink of that," [MASK] said. "My nerves are rotten."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	65292	65284	65335	Brett	"He _was_ there," [MASK] said. "He can't be away from you." "Poor devil!" "I'm not sorry for him. I hate him, myself." "I hate him, too," she shivered.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	65445	65410	65462	Brett	"Want to go in?" "No." We walked out across the wet grass and onto the stone wall of the fortifications. I spread a newspaper on the stone and [MASK] sat down. Across the plain it was dark, and we could see the mountains.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	65522	65515	65564	Brett	"I feel like hell," [MASK] said. "Don't let's talk." We looked out at the plain. The long lines of trees were dark in the moonlight. There were the lights of a car on the road climbing the mountain.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	65613	65600	65650	Brett	Trees were dark along the banks. We sat and looked out. [MASK] stared straight ahead. Suddenly she shivered. "It's cold." "Want to walk back?" "Through the park." We climbed down. It was clouding over again.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	65668	65618	65670	Jake	Suddenly she shivered. "It's cold." "Want to walk back?" "Through the park." We climbed down. It was clouding over again. In the park it was dark under the trees. "Do you still love me, [MASK]?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	65686	65678	65728	Brett	"Because I'm a goner," [MASK] said. "How?" "I'm a goner. I'm mad about the Romero boy. I'm in love with him, I think." "I wouldn't be if I were you."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	65913	65888	65936	Mike	"Oh, darling, don't be difficult. What do you think it's meant to have that damned Jew about, and [MASK] the way he's acted?" "Sure." "I can't just stay tight all the time."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	66009	65962	66011	Brett	"Sure." "I don't say it's right. It is right though for me. God knows, I've never felt such a bitch." "What do you want me to do?" "Come on," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	66093	66080	66132	Romero	They were smoking cigars. When we came in they looked up. [MASK] smiled and bowed. We sat down at a table half-way down the room. "Ask him to come over and have a drink." "Not yet. He'll come over."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	66192	66154	66202	Brett	"I've always done just what I wanted." "I know." "I do feel such a bitch." "Well," I said. "My God!" said [MASK], "the things a woman goes through."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	66286	66268	66318	Brett	"You must have a drink with me," he said. He seated himself, asking [MASK]'s permission without saying anything. He had very nice manners. But he kept on smoking his cigar. It went well with his face. "You like cigars?
TheSunAlsoRises	52	66379	66328	66380	Brett	I always smoke cigars." It was part of his system of authority. It made him seem older. I noticed his skin. It was clear and smooth and very brown. There was a triangular scar on his cheek-bone. I saw he was watching [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	49	66395	66381	66430	Brett	He felt there was something between them. He must have felt it when [MASK] gave him her hand. He was being very careful. I think he was sure, but he did not want to make any mistake. "You fight to-morrow?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	66483	66456	66506	Brett	"No," I said. "Badly?" He shook his head. "Nothing. Here," he showed his hand. [MASK] reached out and spread the fingers apart. "Oh!" he said in English, "you tell fortunes?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	66599	66559	66609	Brett	"Look," he said, "do you see any bulls in my hand?" He laughed. His hand was very fine and the wrist was small. "There are thousands of bulls," [MASK] said. She was not at all nervous now.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	66651	66637	66687	Brett	Tell me some more." "It's a good hand," [MASK] said. "I think he'll live a long time." "Say it to me. Not to your friend." "I said you'd live a long time."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	66694	66654	66705	Romero	"I think he'll live a long time." "Say it to me. Not to your friend." "I said you'd live a long time." "I know it," [MASK] said. "I'm never going to die."
TheSunAlsoRises	44	66717	66697	66741	Romero	"I'm never going to die." I tapped with my finger-tips on the table. [MASK] saw it. He shook his head. "No. Don't do that. The bulls are my best friends."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	66745	66742	66792	Brett	I translated to [MASK]. "You kill your friends?" she asked. "Always," he said in English, and laughed. "So they don't kill me." He looked at her across the table. "You know English well."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	66832	66800	66849	Brett	"Pretty well, sometimes. But I must not let anybody know. It would be very bad, a torero who speaks English." "Why?" asked [MASK]. "It would be bad. The people would not like it. Not yet.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	66926	66881	66927	Nacional	He laughed and tipped his hat down over his eyes and changed the angle of his cigar and the expression of his face. "Like at the table," he said. I glanced over. He had mimicked exactly the expression of [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	45	66954	66928	66973	Brett	He smiled, his face natural again. "No. I must forget English." "Don't forget it, yet," [MASK] said. "No?" "No." "All right." He laughed again.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	66984	66970	67019	Brett	He laughed again. "I would like a hat like that," [MASK] said. "Good. I'll get you one." "Right. See that you do." "I will. I'll get you one to-night."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	67024	67000	67050	Romero	See that you do." "I will. I'll get you one to-night." I stood up. [MASK] rose, too. "Sit down," I said. "I must go and find our friends and bring them here."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	67079	67056	67106	Brett	It was a final look to ask if it were understood. It was understood all right. "Sit down," [MASK] said to him. "You must teach me Spanish." He sat down and looked at her across the table. I went out.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	67812	67807	67854	Mike	What's the matter with [MASK]?" "Probably he owes them money" I said. "That's what people usually get bitter about." In front of the ticket-booths out in the square there were two lines of people waiting.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	67933	67930	67977	Brett	"Where's [MASK]?" he asked. "I don't know." "She was with you." "She must have gone to bed." "She's not." "I don't know where she is."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	68037	67991	68040	Brett	"Tell me where she is." "Sit down," I said. "I don't know where she is." "The hell you don't!" "You can shut your face." "Tell me where [MASK] is."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	68132	68124	68174	Cohn	"Is that where she is?" [MASK] turned to me. "Go to hell!" "She was with you. Is that where she is?" "Go to hell!" "I'll make you tell me"--he stepped forward--"you damned pimp."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	68253	68217	68268	Mike	I went down backward under a table. I tried to get up and felt I did not have any legs. I felt I must get on my feet and try and hit him. [MASK] helped me up. Some one poured a carafe of water on my head.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	68592	68571	68619	Mike	"I'm not one of these chaps likes being knocked about. I never play games, even." [MASK] took a drink. "I never liked to hunt, you know. There was always the danger of having a horse fall on you.
TheSunAlsoRises	42	68723	68705	68747	Mike	"The hell you did," I said. "I'll pay it back," [MASK] said. "I always pay everything back." "That's why you're a bankrupt, isn't it?"
TheSunAlsoRises	52	68748	68734	68786	Edna	"That's why you're a bankrupt, isn't it?" [MASK] said. I stood up. I had heard them talking from a long way away. It all seemed like some bad play. "I'm going over to the hotel," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	68802	68755	68804	Edna	I had heard them talking from a long way away. It all seemed like some bad play. "I'm going over to the hotel," I said. Then I heard them talking about me. "Is he all right?" [MASK] asked.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	69102	69061	69111	Bill	It was like that going up the stairs in the hotel. Going up the stairs took a long time, and I had the feeling that I was carrying my suitcase. There was a light in the room. [MASK] came out and met me in the hall.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	69124	69112	69159	Cohn	"Say," he said, "go up and see [MASK]. He's been in a jam, and he's asking for you." "The hell with him." "Go on. Go on up and see him."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	69196	69148	69197	Cohn	"Go on. Go on up and see him." I did not want to climb another flight of stairs. "What are you looking at me that way for?" "I'm not looking at you. Go on up and see [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	44	69235	69228	69272	Cohn	"But you go up and see [MASK]. He wants to see you." "All right," I said. It was just a matter of climbing more stairs. I went on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	69279	69244	69296	Cohn	"All right," I said. It was just a matter of climbing more stairs. I went on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase. I walked down the hall to [MASK]'s room. The door was shut and I knocked. "Who is it?"
TheSunAlsoRises	51	69406	69358	69409	Cohn	I stood by the door. It was just like this that I had come home. Now it was a hot bath that I needed. A deep, hot bath, to lie back in. "Where's the bathroom?" I asked. [MASK] was crying.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	69462	69450	69499	Jake	"Forgive you, hell." "Please forgive me, [MASK]." I did not say anything. I stood there by the door. "I was crazy. You must see how it was." "Oh, that's all right."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	69507	69478	69528	Brett	"I was crazy. You must see how it was." "Oh, that's all right." "I couldn't stand it about [MASK]." "You called me a pimp." I did not care. I wanted a hot bath.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	69613	69564	69614	Brett	His voice was funny. He lay there in his white shirt on the bed in the dark. His polo shirt. "I'm going away in the morning." He was crying without making any noise. "I just couldn't stand it about [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	51	69711	69675	69726	Brett	He lay there on the bed. "Well," I said, "I'm going to take a bath." "You were the only friend I had, and I loved [MASK] so." "Well," I said, "so long."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	69764	69715	69766	Jake	"Well," I said, "so long." "I guess it isn't any use," he said. "I guess it isn't any damn use." "What?" "Everything. Please say you forgive me, [MASK]."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	69794	69787	69838	Jake	I've been through such hell, [MASK]. Now everything's gone. Everything." "Well," I said, "so long. I've got to go." He rolled over, sat on the edge of the bed, and then stood up.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	69843	69815	69866	Jake	I've got to go." He rolled over, sat on the edge of the bed, and then stood up. "So long, [MASK]," he said. "You'll shake hands, won't you?" "Sure. Why not?"
TheSunAlsoRises	47	69921	69883	69930	Cohn	"Well," I said, "see you in the morning." "I'm going away in the morning." "Oh, yes," I said. I went out. [MASK] was standing in the door of the room.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	69937	69931	69979	Jake	"Are you all right, [MASK]?" he asked. "Oh, yes," I said. "I'm all right." I could not find the bathroom. After a while I found it. There was a deep stone tub.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	71070	71021	71071	Animals	Just for fun. What do you think of that?" "I don't know." "That's it. All for fun. Fun, you understand." "You're not an aficionado?" "Me? What are bulls? [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	47	71145	71103	71150	One	For fun--you understand." He shook his head and walked away, carrying the coffee-pots. Two men were going by in the street. The waiter shouted to them. They were grave-looking. [MASK] shook his head. "
TheSunAlsoRises	51	71187	71154	71205	Muerto	he called. The waiter nodded his head. The two men went on. They were on some errand. The waiter came over to my table. "You hear? [MASK]. Dead. He's dead. With a horn through him. All for morning fun.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	71790	71768	71818	Brett	He should have hit somebody the first time he was insulted, and then gone away. He was so sure that [MASK] loved him. He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all. Some one knocked on the door. "Come in."
TheSunAlsoRises	44	71974	71939	71983	Bill	"Just ahead of them was the crowd, and some chap tripped and brought the whole lot of them down." "And the bulls all came in right over them," [MASK] said. "I heard them yell."
TheSunAlsoRises	43	72028	71993	72036	Mike	"Chaps kept coming out and waving their shirts." "One bull went along the barrera and hooked everybody over." "They took about twenty chaps to the infirmary," [MASK] said. "What a morning!"
TheSunAlsoRises	41	72071	72040	72081	Mike	"The damn police kept arresting chaps that wanted to go and commit suicide with the bulls." "The steers took them in, in the end," [MASK] said. "It took about an hour."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	72145	72137	72185	Edna	"What did you do with the lovely [MASK]?" "We took her home just now. She's gone to bed." "How did she like it?" "Fine. We told her it was just like that every morning."
TheSunAlsoRises	46	72192	72148	72194	Mike	"We took her home just now. She's gone to bed." "How did she like it?" "Fine. We told her it was just like that every morning." "She was impressed," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	72332	72303	72351	Jake	I never saw him hit me. I rather think I saw him just before, and then quite suddenly I was sitting down in the street, and [MASK] was lying under a table." "Where did he go afterward?" I asked. "
TheSunAlsoRises	47	72357	72340	72387	Mike	"Where did he go afterward?" I asked. "Here she is," [MASK] said. "Here's the beautiful lady with the beer." The chambermaid put the tray with the beer-bottles and glasses down on the table.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	72464	72457	72505	Brett	"Why he went in and found [MASK] and the bull-fighter chap in the bull-fighter's room, and then he massacred the poor, bloody bull-fighter." "No." "Yes." "What a night!"
TheSunAlsoRises	49	72568	72529	72578	Brett	Wanted to make an honest woman of her, I imagine. Damned touching scene." He took a long drink of the beer. "He is an ass." "What happened?" "[MASK] gave him what for. She told him off.
TheSunAlsoRises	44	72624	72618	72662	Brett	He wanted to shake hands with [MASK], too." "I know. He shook hands with me." "Did he? Well, they weren't having any of it. The bull-fighter fellow was rather good.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	72680	72644	72694	Cohn	Well, they weren't having any of it. The bull-fighter fellow was rather good. He didn't say much, but he kept getting up and getting knocked down again. [MASK] couldn't knock him out. It must have been damned funny."
TheSunAlsoRises	46	72705	72687	72733	Brett	It must have been damned funny." "Where did you hear all this?" "[MASK]. I saw her this morning." "What happened finally?" "It seems the bull-fighter fellow was sitting on the bed.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	72751	72714	72761	Brett	"What happened finally?" "It seems the bull-fighter fellow was sitting on the bed. He'd been knocked down about fifteen times, and he wanted to fight some more. [MASK] held him and wouldn't let him get up.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	72838	72822	72874	Cohn	"'So you won't hit me?' "'No,' said [MASK]. 'I'd be ashamed to.' "So the bull-fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the face, and then sat down on the floor.
TheSunAlsoRises	42	72881	72841	72883	Brett	I'd be ashamed to.' "So the bull-fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the face, and then sat down on the floor. He couldn't get up, [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	73136	73106	73158	Brett	"This morning. She came in to get some things. She's looking after this Romero lad." He poured out another bottle of beer. "[MASK]'s rather cut up. But she loves looking after people. That's how we came to go off together.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	73181	73166	73216	Mike	"I know," I said. "I'm rather drunk," [MASK] said. "I think I'll _stay_ rather drunk. This is all awfully amusing, but it's not too pleasant. It's not too pleasant for me."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	73226	73184	73232	Brett	"I think I'll _stay_ rather drunk. This is all awfully amusing, but it's not too pleasant. It's not too pleasant for me." He drank off the beer. "I gave [MASK] what for, you know.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	73264	73256	73301	Jake	He leaned forward. "I say, [MASK], do you mind if I drink that bottle of yours? She'll bring you another one." "Please," I said. "I wasn't drinking it, anyway."
TheSunAlsoRises	51	73302	73277	73328	Mike	She'll bring you another one." "Please," I said. "I wasn't drinking it, anyway." [MASK] started to open the bottle. "Would you mind opening it?" I pressed up the wire fastener and poured it for him.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	73409	73379	73427	Ashley	Yes. I've had such a hell of a happy life with the British aristocracy!'" He took a drink. "That was rather good. [MASK], chap she got the title from, was a sailor, you know. Ninth baronet.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	73442	73425	73473	Brett	Ninth baronet. When he came home he wouldn't sleep in a bed. Always made [MASK] sleep on the floor. Finally, when he got really bad, he used to tell her he'd kill her. Always slept with a loaded service revolver.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	73474	73448	73496	Brett	Finally, when he got really bad, he used to tell her he'd kill her. Always slept with a loaded service revolver. [MASK] used to take the shells out when he'd gone to sleep. She hasn't had an absolutely happy life.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	73497	73488	73537	Brett	She hasn't had an absolutely happy life. [MASK]. Damned shame, too. She enjoys things so." He stood up. His hand was shaky. "I'm going in the room. Try and get a little sleep." He smiled.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	73588	73538	73590	Bill	"We go too long without sleep in these fiestas. I'm going to start now and get plenty of sleep. Damn bad thing not to get sleep. Makes you frightfully nervy." "We'll see you at noon at the Iru a," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	73733	73705	73753	Mike	He was damned nasty." "I know the story." "I didn't. Nobody ought to have a right to say things about [MASK]." "That's what makes it bad." "They oughtn't to have any right.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	74169	74158	74208	Brett	"He hired a car." The beer came. [MASK] started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook. She saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip. "Good beer." "Very good," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	43	74213	74196	74239	Mike	"Good beer." "Very good," I said. I was nervous about [MASK]. I did not think he had slept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be under control.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	74375	74326	74377	Mike	I told him I wanted to pop out and see you chaps for a minute." "Is he going to fight?" "Rather. I'm going with you, if you don't mind." "How's your boy friend?" [MASK] asked.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	74515	74504	74549	Mike	"Tell him all about your bull-fighter," [MASK] said. "Oh, to hell with your bull-fighter!" He tipped the table so that all the beers and the dish of shrimps went over in a crash.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	74555	74530	74581	Brett	He tipped the table so that all the beers and the dish of shrimps went over in a crash. "Come on," [MASK] said. "Let's get out of this." In the crowd crossing the square I said: "How is it?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	74615	74582	74632	Brett	"I'm not going to see him after lunch until the fight. His people come in and dress him. They're very angry about me, he says." [MASK] was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was bright.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	74649	74643	74691	Jake	"You've no idea, [MASK]." "Anything you want me to do?" "No, just go to the fight with me." "We'll see you at lunch?" "No. I'm eating with him."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	74730	74682	74732	Brett	"No. I'm eating with him." We were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel. They were carrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade. "Want to take a turn out to the park?" [MASK] asked.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	74832	74796	74845	Brett	We could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed people. They were making the turn at the upper end of the park. "Don't let's go there," [MASK] said. "I don't want staring at just now."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	74876	74852	74902	Brett	It was hot and good after the rain and the clouds from the sea. "I hope the wind goes down," [MASK] said. "It's very bad for him." "So do I." "He says the bulls are all right."
TheSunAlsoRises	44	74917	74917	74961	Brett	[MASK] looked at the yellow wall of the chapel. "Yes. Where the show started on Sunday." "Let's go in. Do you mind? I'd rather like to pray a little for him or something."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	75014	74985	75035	Brett	You saw them as your eyes adjusted themselves to the half-light. We knelt at one of the long wooden benches. After a little I felt [MASK] stiffen beside me, and saw she was looking straight ahead. "Come on," she whispered throatily.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	75058	75027	75079	Brett	"Come on," she whispered throatily. "Let's get out of here. Makes me damned nervous." Outside in the hot brightness of the street [MASK] looked up at the tree-tops in the wind. The praying had not been much of a success.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	75136	75122	75171	Brett	"I've the wrong type of face. "You know," [MASK] said, "I'm not worried about him at all. I just feel happy about him." "Good." "I wish the wind would drop, though."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	75232	75184	75233	Brett	"Let's hope." "You might pray," I laughed. "Never does me any good. I've never gotten anything I prayed for. Have you?" "Oh, yes." "Oh, rot," said [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	49	75315	75293	75342	Cohn	It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way since before she went off with [MASK]. We were back again in front of the hotel. All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with people eating.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	75389	75353	75400	Brett	"Don't let him get too bad." "Your frients haff gone up-stairs," the German ma tre d'h tel said in English. He was a continual eavesdropper. [MASK] turned to him: "Thank you, so much.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	75422	75401	75450	Brett	Have you anything else to say?" "No, _ma'am_." "Good," said [MASK]. "Save us a table for three," I said to the German. He smiled his dirty little pink-and-white smile.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	75462	75424	75477	Brett	"Save us a table for three," I said to the German. He smiled his dirty little pink-and-white smile. "Iss madam eating here?" "No," [MASK] said. "Den I think a tabul for two will be enuff."
TheSunAlsoRises	42	75561	75542	75584	Romero	We had stopped at the floor our rooms were on. She went straight down the hall and into [MASK]'s room. She did not knock. She simply opened the door, went in, and closed it behind her.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	75593	75570	75619	Mike	She simply opened the door, went in, and closed it behind her. I stood in front of the door of [MASK]'s room and knocked. There was no answer. I tried the knob and it opened. Inside the room was in great disorder.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	75639	75599	75651	Mike	There was no answer. I tried the knob and it opened. Inside the room was in great disorder. All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around. There were empty bottles beside the bed. [MASK] lay on the bed looking like a death mask of himself.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	75664	75652	75702	Jake	He opened his eyes and looked at me. "Hello, [MASK]," he said very slowly. "I'm getting a lit tle sleep. I've want ed a lit tle sleep for a long time." "Let me cover you over."
TheSunAlsoRises	52	75732	75681	75733	Mike	I've want ed a lit tle sleep for a long time." "Let me cover you over." "No. I'm quite warm." "Don't go. I have n't got ten to sleep yet." "You'll sleep, [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	50	75788	75754	75804	Mike	"But her Jew has gone away." He turned his head and looked at me. "Damned good thing, what?" "Yes. Now go to sleep, [MASK]. You ought to get some sleep." "I'm just start ing.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	75835	75790	75843	Bill	You ought to get some sleep." "I'm just start ing. I'm go ing to get a lit tle sleep." He shut his eyes. I went out of the room and turned the door to quietly. [MASK] was in my room reading the paper.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	75883	75849	75898	Mike	"Yes." "Let's go and eat." "I won't eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. He was damned snotty when I was getting [MASK] up-stairs." "He was snotty to us, too."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	75999	75972	76022	Bill	He was being polite. "I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen," he said. "Go sit at it," [MASK] said. We went on out across the street. We ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	76075	76032	76081	Brett	It was full of smoke and drinking and singing. The food was good and so was the wine. We did not talk much. Afterward we went to the caf and watched the fiesta come to the boiling-point. [MASK] came over soon after lunch.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	76290	76290	76335	Brett	[MASK] watched it all. She was absorbed in the professional details. "He's his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas," she said. "Why do they call them muletas?" "I don't know."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	76368	76320	76370	Bill	"Why do they call them muletas?" "I don't know." "I wonder if they ever launder them." "I don't think so. It might spoil the color." "The blood must stiffen them," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	76375	76371	76416	Brett	"Funny," [MASK] said. "How one doesn't mind the blood." Below in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged everything. All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	76481	76439	76488	Brett	Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in across the arena. [MASK] was watching them with the glasses.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	76556	76526	76572	Romero	Back of them were their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway and in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors. [MASK] was wearing a black suit. His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	76596	76563	76608	Marcial	His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes. I could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly marked. He was looking straight ahead. [MASK] was smoking a cigarette guardedly, holding it in his hand.
TheSunAlsoRises	43	76879	76861	76904	Brett	His face was discolored and swollen. The sword-handler took the cape, looked up at [MASK], and came over to us and handed up the cape. "Spread it out in front of you," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	41	76905	76892	76933	Brett	"Spread it out in front of you," I said. [MASK] leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold. The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	76941	76919	76969	Brett	The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something. A man beside me leaned over toward [MASK]. "He doesn't want you to spread it," he said. "You should fold it and keep it in your lap."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	77159	77159	77207	Belmonte	[MASK]'s great attraction is working close to the bull. In bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of the bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	77224	77191	77239	Belmonte	As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull he is in great danger. [MASK], in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the bull.
TheSunAlsoRises	59	77786	77780	77839	Marcial	He had expected to compete with [MASK] and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he knew that the sincerity of his own bull-fighting would be so set off by the false sthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he would only have to be in the ring.
TheSunAlsoRises	43	77917	77917	77960	Belmonte	[MASK] was no longer well enough. He no longer had his greatest moments in the bull-ring. He was not sure that there were any great moments. Things were not the same and now life only came in flashes.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	78121	78102	78147	Brett	He loved bull-fighting, and I think he loved the bulls, and I think he loved [MASK]. Everything of which he could control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon. Never once did he look up.
TheSunAlsoRises	54	78253	78203	78257	Belmonte	But he did not do it for her at any loss to himself. He gained by it all through the afternoon. His first "quite" was directly below us. The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. [MASK] was the first.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	78490	78471	78524	Romero	He did not really want to get at the horse. He turned and the group broke apart and [MASK] was taking him out with his cape. He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	78536	78499	78550	Romero	He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. The bull's tail went up and he charged, and [MASK] moved his arms ahead of the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	78601	78594	78646	Romero	The bull wanted it again, and [MASK]'s cape filled again, this time on the other side. Each time he let the bull pass so close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	78817	78771	78819	Brett	The crowd wanted the bull changed. They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with a bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order him replaced. "Why don't they change him?" [MASK] asked.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	78843	78827	78875	Romero	They don't want to lose their money." "It's hardly fair to [MASK]." "Watch how he handles a bull that can't see the color." "It's the sort of thing I don't like to see."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	78915	78876	78925	Romero	It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was doing it. With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or the scarlet flannel of the muleta, [MASK] had to make the bull consent with his body.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	79231	79209	79260	Romero	"The bull's still strong. He wouldn't wear himself out." Out in the centre of the ring [MASK] profiled in front of the bull, drew the sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and sighted along the blade.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	79416	79416	79465	Romero	[MASK] was close enough so the bull could see him. His hand still up, he spoke to the bull. The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward and he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	79471	79466	79515	Romero	They handed the sword to [MASK], and carrying it blade down, the muleta in his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President's box, bowed, straightened, and came over to the barrera and handed over the sword and muleta.
TheSunAlsoRises	55	79614	79596	79651	Romero	It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man in the morning running. During [MASK]'s first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable. Everything he did showed it. All the concentration of the awkwardly delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	79655	79626	79679	Cohn	Everything he did showed it. All the concentration of the awkwardly delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out. The fight with [MASK] had not touched his spirit but his face had been smashed and his body hurt. He was wiping all that out now.
TheSunAlsoRises	52	79721	79695	79747	Romero	It was a good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged easily and surely. He was what [MASK] wanted in bulls. When he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the crowd made him go on.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	79766	79748	79796	Romero	They did not want the bull killed yet, they did not want it to be over. [MASK] went on. It was like a course in bull-fighting. All the passes he linked up, all completed, all slow, templed and smooth.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	79849	79805	79854	Romero	There was no brusqueness. And each pass as it reached the summit gave you a sudden ache inside. The crowd did not want it ever to be finished. The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and [MASK] killed directly below us.
TheSunAlsoRises	41	79905	79875	79916	Romero	He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade. The bull watched him. [MASK] spoke to the bull and tapped one of his feet.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	79977	79941	79988	Romero	Then without taking a step forward, he became one with the bull, the sword was in high between the shoulders, the bull had followed the low-swung flannel, that disappeared as [MASK] lurched clear to the left, and it was over.
TheSunAlsoRises	54	80019	79989	80043	Romero	The bull tried to go forward, his legs commenced to settle, he swung from side to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees, and [MASK]'s older brother leaned forward behind him and drove a short knife into the bull's neck at the base of the horns.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	80067	80044	80093	Romero	The first time he missed. He drove the knife in again, and the bull went over, twitching and rigid. [MASK]'s brother, holding the bull's horn in one hand, the knife in the other, looked up at the President's box.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	80133	80116	80167	Romero	The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull and trotted over with it to [MASK]. The bull lay heavy and black on the sand, his tongue out. Boys were running toward him from all parts of the arena, making a little circle around him.
TheSunAlsoRises	56	80177	80135	80191	Romero	The bull lay heavy and black on the sand, his tongue out. Boys were running toward him from all parts of the arena, making a little circle around him. They were starting to dance around the bull. [MASK] took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the President.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	80311	80311	80356	Romero	[MASK] turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He fought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them, toward the exit.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	80440	80392	80445	Brett	They were lifting him and all running toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody's shoulder. He looked around at us apologetically. The crowd, running, went out the gate with him. We all three went back to the hotel. [MASK] went up-stairs.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	80607	80587	80634	Bill	The men with him were tough-looking and businesslike. "Come on over to the caf ," [MASK] said. "I want an absinthe." It was the last day of the fiesta. Outside it was beginning to be cloudy again.
TheSunAlsoRises	45	80705	80662	80707	Edna	Boys were watching. We passed stands of rockets with long bamboo stems. Outside the caf there was a great crowd. The music and the dancing were going on. The giants and the dwarfs were passing. "Where's [MASK]?"
TheSunAlsoRises	49	80710	80707	80756	Bill	" I asked [MASK]. "I don't know." We watched the beginning of the evening of the last night of the fiesta. The absinthe made everything seem better. I drank it without sugar in the dripping glass, and it was pleasantly bitter.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	80854	80822	80872	Frances	"What do you suppose he'll do?" "Pick up with his old girl, probably." "Who was his old girl?" "Somebody named [MASK]." We had another absinthe. "When do you go back?" I asked.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	80883	80862	80910	Bill	"When do you go back?" I asked. "To-morrow." After a little while [MASK] said: "Well, it was a swell fiesta." "Yes," I said; "something doing all the time."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	80992	80943	80993	Bill	"What's the matter? Feel low?" "Low as hell." "Have another absinthe. Here, waiter! Another absinthe for this se or." "I feel like hell," I said. "Drink that," said [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	50	81100	81072	81122	Bill	Hey, waiter! Another absinthe for this se or!" I poured the water directly into it and stirred it instead of letting it drip. [MASK] put in a lump of ice. I stirred the ice around with a spoon in the brownish, cloudy mixture.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	81265	81220	81270	Brett	"I won't sit down," I said. "I'm going over to the hotel." I was very drunk. I was drunker than I ever remembered having been. At the hotel I went up-stairs. [MASK]'s door was open.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	81325	81324	81372	Brett	"[MASK], you know. She's gone off with the bull-fighter chap." "No." "Yes. She looked for you to say good-bye. They went on the seven o'clock train." "Did they?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	81380	81359	81409	Mike	They went on the seven o'clock train." "Did they?" "Bad thing to do," [MASK] said. "She shouldn't have done it." "No." "Have a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer."
TheSunAlsoRises	53	81461	81410	81463	Mike	"I'm drunk," I said. "I'm going in and lie down." "Are you blind? I was blind myself." "Yes," I said, "I'm blind." "Well, bung-o," [MASK] said.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	81569	81543	81593	Mike	I pretended to be asleep. "He's asleep. Better let him alone." "He's blind as a tick," [MASK] said. They went out. I got up and went to the balcony and looked out at the dancing in the square.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	81652	81602	81653	Bill	It was just very clear and bright, and inclined to blur at the edges. I washed, brushed my hair. I looked strange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the dining-room. "Here he is!" said [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	48	82110	82068	82116	Montoya	You can get the train up from there to-night." "Good. Let's go after lunch." "All right. I'll get the car." We had lunch and paid the bill. [MASK] did not come near us.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	82448	82436	82486	Mike	The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece. We had another round and [MASK] lost again. Each time he gave the bartender a good tip. In a room off the bar there was a good jazz band playing. It was a pleasant bar. We had another round.
TheSunAlsoRises	42	82609	82587	82629	Mike	"I can't get it." "What's the matter?" "I've no money," [MASK] said. "I'm stony. I've just twenty francs. Here, take twenty francs."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	82664	82646	82695	Bill	Damned lucky to have it, too." "I'll cash you a check," [MASK] said. "That's damned nice of you, but you see I can't write checks." "What are you going to do for money?"
TheSunAlsoRises	46	82869	82825	82871	Jews	"She hasn't any money with her?" I asked. "I shouldn't think so. She never has any money. She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to [MASK]."
TheSunAlsoRises	44	82899	82895	82939	Jews	We just call them [MASK]. They're Scotsmen, I believe." "Hasn't she any at all with her?" I asked. "I hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left."
TheSunAlsoRises	47	82944	82909	82956	Bill	"Hasn't she any at all with her?" I asked. "I hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left." "Well," [MASK] said, "we might as well have another drink."
TheSunAlsoRises	57	83080	83071	83128	Bill	"You can't ever tell," said [MASK]. We drove out along the coast road. There was the green of the headlands, the white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue with the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach.
TheSunAlsoRises	46	83171	83165	83211	Bill	The road went on ahead. [MASK] looked at his watch. It was time for us to go back. He knocked on the glass and told the driver to turn around. The driver backed the car out into the grass to turn it.
TheSunAlsoRises	41	83420	83401	83442	Bill	I went as far as the inner gate to the tracks. "So long, fella," [MASK] said. "So long, kid!" "It was swell. I've had a swell time."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	83501	83476	83525	Bill	He went in through the gate to the train. The porter went ahead with the bags. I watched the train pull out. [MASK] was at one of the windows. The window passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	84023	83977	84024	Izzarra	It was a Ch teau Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine was good company. Afterward I had coffee. The waiter recommended a Basque liqueur called [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	50	87549	87500	87550	Brett	"Good," I said. "You see. It is as I said." "Clearly." I followed the maid's back down a long, dark corridor. At the end she knocked on a door. "Hello," said [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	51	87585	87569	87620	Brett	Come in." I opened the door. The maid closed it after me. [MASK] was in bed. She had just been brushing her hair and held the brush in her hand. The room was in that disorder produced only by those who have always had servants.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	87625	87590	87640	Brett	She had just been brushing her hair and held the brush in her hand. The room was in that disorder produced only by those who have always had servants. "Darling!" [MASK] said. I went over to the bed and put my arms around her.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	87673	87667	87717	Darling	She felt very small. "[MASK]! I've had such a hell of a time." "Tell me about it." "Nothing to tell. He only left yesterday. I made him go." "Why didn't you keep him?"
TheSunAlsoRises	50	88353	88347	88397	Mike	"I'm going back to [MASK]." I could feel her crying as I held her close. "He's so damned nice and he's so awful. He's my sort of thing." She would not look up. I stroked her hair.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	88423	88404	88453	Jake	"I won't be one of those bitches," she said. "But, oh, [MASK], please let's never talk about it." We left the Hotel Montana. The woman who ran the hotel would not let me pay the bill.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	88470	88465	88518	Brett	Let it go," [MASK] said. "It doesn't matter now." We rode in a taxi down to the Palace Hotel, left the bags, arranged for berths on the Sud Express for the night, and went into the bar of the hotel for a cocktail.
TheSunAlsoRises	48	88611	88576	88624	Brett	"No matter how vulgar a hotel is, the bar is always nice." "It's odd." "Bartenders have always been fine." "You know," [MASK] said, "it's quite true. He is only nineteen.
TheSunAlsoRises	50	88721	88690	88740	Brett	"Thanks." "I should have asked, you know." The barman went far enough up the bar so that he would not hear our conversation. [MASK] had sipped from the Martini as it stood, on the wood. Then she picked it up.
TheSunAlsoRises	47	88860	88824	88871	Brett	_Would_ you buy a lady a drink?" "We'll have two more Martinis." "As they were before, sir?" "They were very good." [MASK] smiled at him. "Thank you, ma'am."
TheSunAlsoRises	49	88894	88889	88938	Brett	"You know," [MASK] said, "he'd only been with two women before. He never cared about anything but bull-fighting." "He's got plenty of time." "I don't know. He thinks it was me.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	89011	88962	89013	Jake	"I thought you weren't going to ever talk about it." "How can I help it?" "You'll lose it if you talk about it." "I just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, [MASK]."
TheSunAlsoRises	50	89112	89063	89113	Brett	"Quite a lot." "He never worked very well with me." "Should we have another Martini?" The barman shook up two more Martinis and poured them out into fresh glasses. "Where will we have lunch?" I asked [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	50	89284	89254	89304	Brett	"My God! what a meal you've eaten." "I feel fine. Do you want a dessert?" "Lord, no." [MASK] was smoking. "You like to eat, don't you?" she said. "Yes.
TheSunAlsoRises	51	89362	89320	89371	Brett	"What do you like to do?" "Oh," I said, "I like to do a lot of things. Don't you want a dessert?" "You asked me that once," [MASK] said. "Yes," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	49	89446	89413	89462	Brett	You haven't seen." "Let's get two bottles," I said. The bottles came. I poured a little in my glass, then a glass for [MASK], then filled my glass. We touched glasses. "Bung-o!"
TheSunAlsoRises	53	89489	89483	89536	Jake	"Don't get drunk, [MASK]," she said. "You don't have to." "How do you know?" "Don't," she said. "You'll be all right." "I'm not getting drunk," I said.
TheSunAlsoRises	53	89564	89518	89571	Jake	"You'll be all right." "I'm not getting drunk," I said. "I'm just drinking a little wine. I like to drink wine." "Don't get drunk," she said. "[MASK], don't get drunk."
TheSunAlsoRises	48	89701	89654	89702	Brett	Up the street was a little square with trees and grass where there were taxis parked. A taxi came up the street, the waiter hanging out at the side. I tipped him and told the driver where to drive, and got in beside [MASK].
TheSunAlsoRises	50	89714	89703	89753	Brett	The driver started up the street. I settled back. [MASK] moved close to me. We sat close against each other. I put my arm around her and she rested against me comfortably. It was very hot and bright, and the houses looked sharply white.
