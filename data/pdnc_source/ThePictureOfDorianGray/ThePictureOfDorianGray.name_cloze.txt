ThePictureOfDorianGray	57	1199	1195	1252	Basil	Upon my word, [MASK], I didn t know you were so vain; and I really can t see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	1257	1253	1308	Basil	Why, my dear [MASK], he is a Narcissus, and you well, of course you have an intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	1473	1432	1484	Basil	He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don t flatter yourself, [MASK]: you are not in the least like him."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	1492	1485	1536	Harry	"You don t understand me, [MASK]," answered the artist. "Of course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	2202	2193	2247	Basil	"I am afraid I must be going, [MASK]," he murmured, "and before I go, I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago." "What is that?" said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	2260	2230	2273	Harry	"What is that?" said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground. "You know quite well." "I do not, [MASK]." "Well, I will tell you what it is.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	3011	2962	3012	Basil	I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take no credit to myself for trying to escape." "Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	3035	3023	3072	Harry	That is all." "I don t believe that, [MASK], and I don t believe you do either. However, whatever was my motive and it may have been pride, for I used to be very proud I certainly struggled to the door.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	3315	3283	3335	Dorian	Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of that. [MASK] told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined to know each other."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	3636	3627	3668	Harry	"You don t understand what friendship is, [MASK]," he murmured "or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	3815	3767	3816	Harry	I have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of me? I think it is rather vain." "I should think it was, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	3834	3817	3866	Basil	But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance." "My dear old [MASK], you are much more than an acquaintance." "And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?" "Oh, brothers!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	4054	4017	4064	Harry	And yet I don t suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly." "I don t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is more, [MASK], I feel sure you don t either."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	4093	4088	4134	Basil	"How English you are [MASK]! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman always a rash thing to do he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	4334	4300	4350	Harry	I thought you would never care for anything but your art." "He is all my art to me now," said the painter gravely. "I sometimes think, [MASK], that there are only two eras of any importance in the world s history.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	4742	4733	4774	Agnew	You remember that landscape of mine, for which [MASK] offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever done. And why is it so?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	4825	4789	4830	Basil	Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and always missed." "[MASK], this is extraordinary!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	5052	5004	5058	Harry	He shall never know anything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, [MASK] too much of myself!"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	5098	5089	5139	Hallward	"I hate them for it," cried [MASK]. "An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	5320	5316	5365	Harry	Then I feel, [MASK], that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer s day."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	5651	5612	5658	Harry	What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic." "[MASK], don t talk like that.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	5693	5674	5726	Basil	You can t feel what I feel. You change too often." "Ah, my dear [MASK], that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love s tragedies."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	6162	6118	6168	Harry	I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend." "I am very glad you didn t, [MASK]." "Why?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	6374	6331	6380	Harry	The world is wide, and has many marvellous people in it. Don t take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist depends on him. Mind, [MASK], I trust you."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	6473	6438	6485	Basil	He was seated at the piano, with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann s "Forest Scenes." "You must lend me these, [MASK]," he cried. "I want to learn them.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	6504	6492	6547	Dorian	"That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, [MASK]." "Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don t want a life-sized portrait of myself," answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a wilful, petulant manner.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	7161	7138	7184	Basil	But I certainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don t really mind, [MASK], do you? You have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	7828	7813	7864	Dorian	And yet " "Just turn your head a little more to the right, [MASK], like a good boy," said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look had come into the lad s face that he had never seen there before.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	8634	8622	8671	Hallward	Had it hit the mark? How fascinating the lad was! [MASK] painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes only from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	8765	8734	8783	Harry	You were perfectly still. And I have caught the effect I wanted the half-parted lips and the bright look in the eyes. I don t know what [MASK] has been saying to you, but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	8931	8911	8958	Dorian	I have got to work up this background, so I will join you later on. Don t keep [MASK] too long. I have never been in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my masterpiece.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	10646	10620	10674	Hallward	The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that broke the stillness, except when, now and then, [MASK] stepped back to look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	10900	10900	10955	Dorian	[MASK] made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	10967	10936	10981	Hallward	A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that [MASK] was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	57	11228	11189	11246	Hallward	His eyes deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart. "Don t you like it?" cried [MASK] at last, stung a little by the lad s silence, not understanding what it meant.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	11302	11259	11311	Harry	"Who wouldn t like it? It is one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you like to ask for it. I must have it." "It is not my property, [MASK]." "Whose property is it?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	11508	11502	11545	Basil	"I believe you would, [MASK]. You like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say." The painter stared in amazement.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	11550	11510	11559	Dorian	You like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say." The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike [MASK] to speak like that. What had happened?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	11690	11690	11741	Dorian	[MASK]!" he cried, "don t talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I shall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things, are you? you who are finer than any of them!"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	11873	11832	11880	Harry	The hot tears welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying. "This is your doing, [MASK]," said the painter bitterly.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	11951	11950	11997	Harry	"[MASK], I can t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	12131	12099	12150	Hallward	He had found it at last. He was going to rip up the canvas. With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to [MASK], tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of the studio.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	12182	12161	12208	Dorian	he cried. "It would be murder!" "I am glad you appreciate my work at last, [MASK]," said the painter coldly when he had recovered from his surprise. "I never thought you would." "Appreciate it?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	12216	12209	12261	Basil	I am in love with it, [MASK]. It is part of myself. I feel that." "Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	56	12284	12229	12285	Dorian	"Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself." And he walked across the room and rang the bell for tea. "You will have tea, of course, [MASK]?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	12408	12358	12409	Basil	It was the most premature definition ever given. Man is many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after all though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You had much better let me have it, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	12735	12699	12751	Hallward	I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have all the surprise of candour." "It is such a bore putting on one s dress-clothes," muttered [MASK]. "And, when one has them on, they are so horrid."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	12869	12856	12897	Basil	"Then you shall come; and you will come, too, [MASK], won t you?" "I can t, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	13227	13221	13262	Hallward	"Very well," said [MASK], and he went over and laid down his cup on the tray. "It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better lose no time.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	13391	13387	13430	Basil	Good-bye, [MASK]. It has been a most interesting afternoon." As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a sofa, and a look of pain came into his face. CHAPTER III.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	14051	14018	14062	Harry	What I want is information: not useful information, of course; useless information." "Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, [MASK], although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	14385	14383	14430	Kelso	They said [MASK] got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his son-in-law in public paid him, sir, to do it, paid him and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	14441	14431	14483	Kelso	The thing was hushed up, but, egad, [MASK] ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	42	14574	14546	14588	Kelso	"I hope he will fall into proper hands," continued the old man. "He should have a pot of money waiting for him if [MASK] did the right thing by him. His mother had money, too.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	14626	14626	14675	Egad	[MASK], I was ashamed of him. The Queen used to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. They made quite a story of it. I didn t dare show my face at Court for a month.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	14779	14755	14809	Carlington	What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could understand. She could have married anybody she chose. [MASK] was mad after her. She was romantic, though. All the women of that family were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	42	14815	14785	14827	Carlington	She was romantic, though. All the women of that family were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful. [MASK] went on his knees to her. Told me so himself.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	15217	15170	15219	Harry	I shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me the information I wanted. I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones." "Where are you lunching, [MASK]?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	15491	15457	15504	Worlds	Yes; it was an interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic. [MASK] had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might blow....
ThePictureOfDorianGray	59	15713	15692	15751	Basil	He was a marvellous type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a chance he had met in [MASK] s studio, or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for us.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	15788	15752	15801	Basil	There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade! ... And [MASK]? From a psychological point of view, how interesting he was!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	17725	17711	17761	Duchess	Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, [MASK]?" he asked, looking at her across the table. "A great many, I fear," she cried. "Then commit them over again," he said gravely.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	18274	18232	18275	Agatha	If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn t have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would ruin it. No, I must go, dear [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	19211	19171	19216	Harry	The formal monotonous ticking of the Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or twice he thought of going away. At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. "How late you are, [MASK]!" he murmured.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	19410	19370	19422	Victoria	She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her name was [MASK], and she had a perfect mania for going to church.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	19587	19584	19634	Harry	I always hear [MASK] s views from his friends. It is the only way I get to know of them. But you must not think I don t like good music. I adore it, but I am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	19647	19618	19668	Harry	I adore it, but I am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped pianists two at a time, sometimes, [MASK] tells me. I don t know what it is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	20126	20096	20141	Harry	Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed." "I don t think I am likely to marry, [MASK]. I am too much in love. That is one of your aphorisms.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	20309	20268	20315	Harry	Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals." "[MASK], how can you?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	20319	20316	20370	Dorian	"My dear [MASK], it is quite true. I am analysing women at present, so I ought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was. I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and the coloured.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	20517	20506	20553	Harry	How long have you known her?" "Ah! [MASK], your views terrify me." "Never mind that. How long have you known her?" "About three weeks." "And where did you come across her?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	20560	20538	20585	Harry	"About three weeks." "And where did you come across her?" "I will tell you, [MASK], but you mustn t be unsympathetic about it. After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	20919	20885	20930	Harry	Have a box, my Lord? he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility. There was something about him, [MASK], that amused me. He was such a monster.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	20978	20956	21007	Harry	To the present day I can t make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn t my dear [MASK], if I hadn t I should have missed the greatest romance of my life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	21014	20995	21046	Dorian	I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!" "I am not laughing, [MASK]; at least I am not laughing at you. But you should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the first romance of your life.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	58	21436	21380	21438	Harry	"It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama." "Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder what on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill. What do you think the play was, [MASK]?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	56	21470	21452	21508	Dorian	Our fathers used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I live, [MASK], the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, _les grandp res ont toujours tort_."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	21518	21475	21519	Harry	I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, _les grandp res ont toujours tort_." "This play was good enough for us, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	21539	21526	21574	Shakespeare	I must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing [MASK] done in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	21640	21640	21695	Mercutio	[MASK] was almost as bad. He was played by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	21697	21646	21698	Juliet	He was played by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But [MASK]!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	21699	21699	21748	Harry	[MASK], imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	21791	21787	21839	Harry	I tell you, [MASK], I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me. And her voice I never heard such a voice. It was very low at first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one s ear.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	21954	21921	21968	Harry	When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each of them says something different. I don t know which to follow. Why should I not love her? [MASK], I do love her. She is everything to me in life.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	22189	22137	22190	Harry	There is no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an actress! How different an actress is! [MASK]!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	22218	22191	22246	Dorian	why didn t you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress?" "Because I have loved so many of them, [MASK]." "Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces." "Don t run down dyed hair and painted faces.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	22303	22300	22348	Harry	"Yes, [MASK], I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things. You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would come and confess it to you. You would understand me."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	22363	22327	22377	Dorian	If I ever did a crime, I would come and confess it to you. You would understand me." "People like you the wilful sunbeams of life don t commit crimes, [MASK]. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	22736	22686	22737	Dorian	"I should not wonder if he was quite right there. But, on the other hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all expensive." "Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means," laughed [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	22827	22776	22828	Shakespeare	The next night, of course, I arrived at the place again. When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that I was a munificent patron of art. He was a most offensive brute, though he had an extraordinary passion for [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	22875	22858	22906	Dorian	He seemed to think it a distinction." "It was a distinction, my dear [MASK] a great distinction. Most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life. To have ruined one s self over poetry is an honour.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	22928	22924	22975	Rosalind	She had been playing [MASK]. I could not help going round. I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at me at least I fancied that she had. The old Jew was persistent. He seemed determined to take me behind, so I consented.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	23004	22958	23008	Harry	The old Jew was persistent. He seemed determined to take me behind, so I consented. It was curious my not wanting to know her, wasn t it?" "No; I don t think so." "My dear [MASK], why?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	23029	23028	23076	Sibyl	"[MASK]? Oh, she was so shy and so gentle. There is something of a child about her. Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of her power.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	23129	23085	23138	Sibyl	The old Jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like children. He would insist on calling me My Lord, so I had to assure [MASK] that I was not anything of the kind.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	23300	23286	23334	Sibyl	There is always something infinitely mean about other people s tragedies." "[MASK] is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where she came from? From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and entirely divine.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	59	23452	23442	23501	Sibyl	"Well, I can t help going to see [MASK] play," he cried, "even if it is only for a single act. I get hungry for her presence; and when I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I am filled with awe."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	23512	23470	23518	Dorian	I get hungry for her presence; and when I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I am filled with awe." "You can dine with me to-night, [MASK], can t you?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	23639	23635	23678	Romeo	I want to make [MASK] jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	23682	23658	23710	Harry	I want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. My God, [MASK], how I worship her!" He was walking up and down the room as he spoke. Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	23805	23800	23846	Basil	"I want you and [MASK] to come with me some night and see her act. I have not the slightest fear of the result. You are certain to acknowledge her genius. Then we must get her out of the Jew s hands.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	24057	24036	24085	Romeo	We must be there before the curtain rises. You must see her in the first act, where she meets [MASK]." "Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea, or reading an English novel.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	24100	24060	24113	Basil	"Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea, or reading an English novel. It must be seven. No gentleman dines before seven. Shall you see [MASK] between this and then? Or shall I write to him?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	24247	24219	24267	Basil	"People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity." "Oh, [MASK] is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit of a Philistine.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	24283	24282	24336	Basil	"[MASK], my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his work. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	26477	26477	26527	Sybil	[MASK] rushed to her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her. "Forgive me, Mother. I know it pains you to talk about our father. But it only pains you because you loved him so much. Don t look so sad.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	26796	26762	26811	Sibyl	She mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience. She felt sure that the _tableau_ was interesting. "You might keep some of your kisses for me, [MASK], I think," said the lad with a good-natured grumble.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	27289	27285	27334	James	"Quite ready, [MASK]," she answered, keeping her eyes on her work. For some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this rough stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature was troubled when their eyes met.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	27388	27359	27411	James	She began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. "I hope you will be contented, [MASK], with your sea-faring life," she said. "You must remember that it is your own choice.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	27475	27421	27476	Sibyl	Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the country often dine with the best families." "I hate offices, and I hate clerks," he replied. "But you are quite right. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	27551	27531	27579	James	Is that right? What about that?" "You are speaking about things you don t understand, [MASK]. In the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	27590	27580	27629	Sibyl	That was when acting was really understood. As for [MASK], I do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not. But there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He is always most polite to me.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	27742	27732	27781	Sibyl	"My son, you distress me very much. [MASK] is always under my special care. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why she should not contract an alliance with him. I trust he is one of the aristocracy.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	27802	27773	27823	Sibyl	I trust he is one of the aristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be a most brilliant marriage for [MASK]. They would make a charming couple. His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	27855	27842	27892	Sibyl	He had just turned round to say something when the door opened and [MASK] ran in. "How serious you both are!" she cried. "What is the matter?" "Nothing," he answered. "I suppose one must be serious sometimes.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	28136	28114	28159	Sibyl	He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace. [MASK], however, was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing. Her love was trembling in laughter on her lips.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	28667	28619	28670	Sibyl	The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was heart-sick at leaving home. Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose. Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger of [MASK] s position.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	28969	28916	28971	Sibyl	"What do you want me to say?" "Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us," she answered, smiling at him. He shrugged his shoulders. "You are more likely to forget me than I am to forget you, [MASK]."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	28981	28972	29016	Jim	She flushed. "What do you mean, [MASK]?" she asked. "You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told me about him? He means you no good."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	29020	28984	29034	Jim	she asked. "You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told me about him? He means you no good." "Stop, [MASK]!" she exclaimed. "You must not say anything against him.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	29167	29126	29176	Juliet	You will like him so much. Everybody likes him, and I ... love him. I wish you could come to the theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play [MASK]. Oh! how I shall play it!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	29427	29387	29435	Sibyl	"I shudder at the thought of being free." "I want you to beware of him." "To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him." "[MASK], you are mad about him."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	29646	29600	29649	Sibyl	The brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies. She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects. He spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as players at a game pass counters. [MASK] felt oppressed.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	29816	29809	29858	Sibyl	"He is gone," murmured [MASK] sadly. "I wish you had seen him." "I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does you any wrong, I shall kill him."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	29898	29866	29917	Jim	He repeated his words. They cut the air like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing close to her tittered. "Come away, [MASK]; come away," she whispered. He followed her doggedly as she passed through the crowd.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	29963	29951	30002	Jim	She shook her head at him. "You are foolish, [MASK], utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that is all. How can you say such horrible things? You don t know what you are talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	30900	30865	30914	Sibyl	Highly connected, too, I suppose." For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her head drooped. She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. "[MASK] has a mother," she murmured; "I had none."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	31171	31166	31215	Sibyl	She consoled herself by telling [MASK] how desolate she felt her life would be, now that she had only one child to look after. She remembered the phrase. It had pleased her. Of the threat she said nothing. It was vividly and dramatically expressed.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	31361	31361	31402	Dorian	[MASK] engaged to be married!" he cried. "Impossible!" "It is perfectly true." "To whom?" "To some little actress or other." "I can t believe it.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	31403	31368	31409	Dorian	he cried. "Impossible!" "It is perfectly true." "To whom?" "To some little actress or other." "I can t believe it. [MASK] is far too sensible."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	31519	31477	31528	Dorian	There is a great difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I never was engaged." "But think of [MASK] s birth, and position, and wealth.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	57	31558	31529	31586	Basil	It would be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him." "If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, [MASK]. He is sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	31649	31648	31692	Dorian	"[MASK] says she is beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind. Your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst others.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	31722	31693	31745	Basil	We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn t forget his appointment." "Are you serious?" "Quite serious, [MASK]. I should be miserable if I thought I should ever be more serious than I am at the present moment."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	31754	31724	31771	Harry	I should be miserable if I thought I should ever be more serious than I am at the present moment." "But do you approve of it, [MASK]?" asked the painter, walking up and down the room and biting his lip.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	31889	31883	31930	Messalina	Why not? If he wedded [MASK], he would be none the less interesting. You know I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack individuality.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	32272	32231	32284	Dorian	As for marriage, of course that would be silly, but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being fashionable. But here is [MASK] himself. He will tell you more than I can."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	32498	32455	32509	Dorian	"Come, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and then you will tell us how it all came about." "There is really not much to tell," cried [MASK] as they took their seats at the small round table.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	32668	32651	32704	Basil	She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, [MASK]. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose. As for her acting well, you shall see her to-night. She is simply a born artist.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	32932	32902	32954	Basil	I don t care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do what I like. I have been right, [MASK], haven t I, to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare s plays?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	33087	33076	33127	Harry	Perhaps you forgot all about it." "My dear [MASK], I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did not make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and she said she was not worthy to be my wife.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	33566	33541	33590	Harry	"Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories about pleasure. All your theories, in fact, [MASK]." "Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about," he answered in his slow melodious voice. "
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	33864	33826	33879	Harry	I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality." "But, surely, if one lives merely for one s self, [MASK], one pays a terrible price for doing so?" suggested the painter.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	33944	33926	33969	Basil	"One has to pay in other ways but money." "What sort of ways, [MASK]?" "Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the consciousness of degradation."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	34202	34197	34241	Harry	"You must admit, [MASK], that women give to men the very gold of their lives." "Possibly," he sighed, "but they invariably want it back in such very small change. That is the worry.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	34271	34237	34288	Harry	That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman once put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out." "[MASK], you are dreadful! I don t know why I like you so much."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	34296	34277	34327	Dorian	I don t know why I like you so much." "You will always like me, [MASK]," he replied. "Will you have some coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine-champagne_, and some cigarettes.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	34339	34328	34376	Basil	No, don t mind the cigarettes I have some. [MASK], I can t allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	34385	34356	34411	Dorian	A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes, [MASK], you will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	34418	34395	34443	Harry	I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit." "What nonsense you talk, [MASK]!" cried the lad, taking a light from a fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	34557	34511	34564	Dorian	I am afraid, however, that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still, your wonderful girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real than life. Let us go. [MASK], you will come with me.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	34570	34565	34612	Basil	I am so sorry, [MASK], but there is only room for two in the brougham. You must follow us in a hansom." They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The painter was silent and preoccupied.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	34893	34893	34943	Hallward	[MASK] amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	35160	35151	35203	Dorian	"Don t pay any attention to him, [MASK]," said the painter. "I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	57	35678	35622	35679	Romeo	Her body swayed, while she danced, as a plant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a white lily. Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory. Yet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when her eyes rested on [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	35827	35787	35836	Juliet	He was puzzled and anxious. Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed. Yet they felt that the true test of any [MASK] is the balcony scene of the second act.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	36183	36177	36221	Dorian	"She is quite beautiful, [MASK]," he said, "but she can t act. Let us go." "I am going to see the play through," answered the lad, in a hard bitter voice.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	36236	36196	36244	Harry	Let us go." "I am going to see the play through," answered the lad, in a hard bitter voice. "I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an evening, [MASK]. I apologize to you both."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	36331	36282	36332	Dorian	"But she seems to me to be simply callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she was a great artist. This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress." "Don t talk like that about any one you love, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	36409	36387	36440	Juliet	Besides, I don t suppose you will want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays [MASK] like a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	36544	36544	36597	Basil	[MASK], you must go. Ah! can t you see that my heart is breaking?" The hot tears came to his eyes. His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	36803	36756	36805	Dorian	There was a radiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of their own. When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy came over her. "How badly I acted to-night, [MASK]!"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	36855	36841	36889	Dorian	You have no idea what I suffered." The girl smiled. "[MASK]," she answered, lingering over his name with long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to the red petals of her mouth. "
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	36890	36890	36942	Dorian	[MASK], you should have understood. But you understand now, don t you?" "Understand what?" he asked, angrily. "Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall never act well again."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	37381	37351	37399	Dorian	The knowledge was exquisite to me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love such as ours? Take me away, [MASK] take me away with you, where we can be quite alone. I hate the stage.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	38116	38068	38117	Dorian	I will work so hard and try to improve. Don t be cruel to me, because I love you better than anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not pleased you. But you are quite right, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	40024	39976	40025	Sibyl	he murmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	40114	40108	40163	Victor	Finally his bell sounded, and [MASK] came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall windows.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	40814	40804	40854	Victor	"I am not at home to any one, [MASK]," he said with a sigh. The man bowed and retired. Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	41513	41480	41526	Dorian	When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution. When [MASK] had finished the letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	41781	41760	41811	Harry	"I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?" "I was brutal, [MASK] perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know myself better."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	41815	41792	41847	Dorian	I am not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know myself better." "Ah, [MASK], I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	41858	41848	41900	Dorian	"I have got through all that," said [MASK], shaking his head and smiling. "I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in us.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	41907	41866	41916	Harry	"I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in us. Don t sneer at it, [MASK], any more at least not before me.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	41945	41917	41961	Dorian	I want to be good. I can t bear the idea of my soul being hideous." "A very charming artistic basis for ethics, [MASK]! I congratulate you on it. But how are you going to begin?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	42037	42010	42060	Sibyl	Something dreadful about marriage. Don t say it. Don t ever say things of that kind to me again. Two days ago I asked [MASK] to marry me. I am not going to break my word to her. She is to be my wife."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	42065	42042	42092	Dorian	I am not going to break my word to her. She is to be my wife." "Your wife! [MASK]! ... Didn t you get my letter? I wrote to you this morning, and sent the note down by my own man."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	42111	42093	42144	Harry	"Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, [MASK]. I was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn t like. You cut life to pieces with your epigrams." "You know nothing then?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	42405	42365	42413	Dorian	I suppose they don t know your name at the theatre? If they don t, it is all right. Did any one see you going round to her room? That is an important point." [MASK] did not answer for a few moments.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	42480	42469	42522	Dorian	"I have no doubt it was not an accident, [MASK], though it must be put in that way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving the theatre with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had forgotten something upstairs.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	42679	42641	42691	Dorian	I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen. I should have thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and seemed to know so little about acting. [MASK], you mustn t let this thing get on your nerves.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	42840	42824	42871	Harry	How extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book, [MASK], I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	42922	42872	42923	Sibyl	Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent people we call the dead? [MASK]!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	42936	42934	42981	Harry	Oh, [MASK], how I loved her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was everything to me. Then came that dreadful night was it really only last night? when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	43057	43054	43105	Harry	My God! [MASK], what shall I do? You don t know the danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have done that for me. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	43969	43920	43970	Dorian	What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar." "I must sow poppies in my garden," sighed [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	44429	44386	44435	Conscience	Religion consoles some. Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. [MASK] makes egotists of us all.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	44470	44436	44484	Harry	Yes; there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one." "What is that, [MASK]?" said the lad listlessly. "Oh, the obvious consolation.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	44710	44661	44712	Harry	And, after all, you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to everything." "What was that, [MASK]?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	45010	45002	45054	Harry	"You have explained me to myself, [MASK]," he murmured with something of a sigh of relief. "I felt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not express it to myself. How well you know me!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	45101	45073	45122	Dorian	That is all. I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous." "Life has everything in store for you, [MASK]. There is nothing that you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	45254	45214	45263	Harry	We cannot spare you. And now you had better dress and drive down to the club. We are rather late, as it is." "I think I shall join you at the opera, [MASK]. I feel too tired to eat anything.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	45322	45275	45324	Dorian	"Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her name on the door. But I am sorry you won t come and dine." "I don t feel up to it," said [MASK] listlessly.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	46453	46443	46498	Dorian	"I am so glad I have found you, [MASK]," he said gravely. "I called last night, and they told me you were at the opera. Of course, I knew that was impossible. But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	46785	46758	46806	Harry	Don t talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn t talk about a thing, it has never happened. It is simply expression, as [MASK] says, that gives reality to things. I may mention that she was not the woman s only child.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	46858	46819	46873	Hallward	But he is not on the stage. He is a sailor, or something. And now, tell me about yourself and what you are painting." "You went to the opera?" said [MASK], speaking very slowly and with a strained touch of pain in his voice.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	46904	46891	46941	Patti	You can talk to me of other women being charming, and of [MASK] singing divinely, before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in? Why, man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	46955	46947	46991	Dorian	I won t hear it!" cried [MASK], leaping to his feet. "You must not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is past is past." "You call yesterday the past?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	47071	47070	47119	Dorian	"[MASK], this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural, and affectionate then.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	47160	47120	47168	Harry	You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don t know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all [MASK] s influence. I see that."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	47368	47365	47412	Basil	"My dear [MASK]! Surely you don t think it was a vulgar accident? Of course she killed herself." The elder man buried his face in his hands. "How fearful," he muttered, and a shudder ran through him.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	47485	47441	47493	Sibyl	As a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean middle-class virtue and all that kind of thing. How different [MASK] was! She lived her finest tragedy.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	47532	47494	47545	Juliet	She was always a heroine. The last night she played the night you saw her she acted badly because she had known the reality of love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as [MASK] might have died. She passed again into the sphere of art.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	47618	47617	47664	Harry	Even [MASK], who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except sentimentalists.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	47671	47646	47696	Basil	Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, [MASK]. You come down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled, and you are furious.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	47709	47703	47753	Harry	You remind me of a story [MASK] told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	56	47780	47754	47810	Basil	He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear old [MASK], if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point of view.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	47961	47950	48002	Harry	To become the spectator of one s own life, as [MASK] says, is to escape the suffering of life. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	48052	48003	48053	Harry	I am a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must always be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	48095	48054	48103	Basil	But I know that you are better than he is. You are not stronger you are too much afraid of life but you are better. And how happy we used to be together! Don t leave me, [MASK], and don t quarrel with me.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	48194	48173	48224	Dorian	There was so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble. "Well, [MASK]," he said at length, with a sad smile, "I won t speak to you again about this horrible thing, after to-day.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	48254	48225	48276	Dorian	I only trust your name won t be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is to take place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?" [MASK] shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at the mention of the word "inquest.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	48405	48374	48423	Dorian	I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words." "I will try and do something, [MASK], if it would please you. But you must come and sit to me yourself again.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	48442	48413	48454	Basil	But you must come and sit to me yourself again. I can t get on without you." "I can never sit to you again, [MASK]. It is impossible!" he exclaimed, starting back.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	48563	48528	48577	Basil	It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt the room looked different as I came in." "My servant has nothing to do with it, [MASK]. You don t imagine I let him arrange my room for me?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	48725	48716	48765	Basil	"If you try to look at it, [MASK], on my word of honour I will never speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I don t offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	48783	48745	48786	Hallward	I am quite serious. I don t offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But, remember, if you touch this screen, everything is over between us." [MASK] was thunderstruck.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	48838	48796	48846	Dorian	He had never seen him like this before. The lad was actually pallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all over. "[MASK]!" "Don t speak!"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	49219	49191	49239	Harry	You can t have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition. You told [MASK] exactly the same thing." He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his eyes.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	49320	49319	49370	Basil	"[MASK]," he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in the face, "we have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I shall tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	49380	49380	49431	Dorian	[MASK], if I told you, you might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I could not bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me never to look at your picture again, I am content.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	56	49532	49526	49582	Dorian	"Let us sit down, [MASK]," said the painter, looking troubled. "Let us sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the picture something curious? something that probably at first did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	49584	49555	49608	Basil	Have you noticed in the picture something curious? something that probably at first did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?" "[MASK]!" cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	49629	49609	49661	Dorian	"I see you did. Don t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say. [MASK], from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and power, by you.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	49841	49814	49858	Paris	Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you. Then came a new development. I had drawn you as [MASK] in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman s cloak and polished boar-spear.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	50039	50025	50073	Dorian	I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, [MASK], that I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	50093	50059	50112	Harry	Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me. [MASK], to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not mind that.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	50323	50290	50331	Dorian	It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me, [MASK], for what I have told you.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	50543	50500	50547	Dorian	Did you really see it?" "I saw something in it," he answered, "something that seemed to me very curious." "Well, you don t mind my looking at the thing now?" [MASK] shook his head.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	50556	50548	50592	Basil	"You must not ask me that, [MASK]. I could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture." "You will some day, surely?" "Never." "Well, perhaps you are right.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	50599	50581	50631	Dorian	"Never." "Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, [MASK]. You have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art. Whatever I have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	50745	50695	50746	Dorian	It was a confession. Now that I have made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps one should never put one s worship into words." "It was a very disappointing confession." "Why, what did you expect, [MASK]?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	50801	50760	50810	Basil	There was nothing else to see?" "No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you mustn t talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, [MASK], and we must always remain so."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	50945	50930	50980	Basil	Few come across one." "I can t explain it to you, [MASK], but I must never sit to you again. There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its own. I will come and have tea with you.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	51000	50981	51031	Hallward	That will be just as pleasant." "Pleasanter for you, I am afraid," murmured [MASK] regretfully. "And now good-bye. I am sorry you won t let me look at the picture once again. But that can t be helped.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	51477	51427	51478	Leaf	"Why, it is full of dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It is not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed." "I don t want it put straight, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	51642	51598	51648	Leaf	I ll have it off the bunch in a moment. But you don t think of living up there, sir, and you so comfortable here?" "No, no," he cried petulantly. "Thank you, [MASK]. That will do."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	56	51693	51649	51705	Dorian	She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of the household. He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought best. She left the room, wreathed in smiles. As the door closed, [MASK] put the key in his pocket and looked round the room.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	51867	51829	51880	Basil	They would defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive. He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told [MASK] the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	52215	52209	52260	Monsieur	"The persons are here, [MASK]." He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be allowed to know where the picture was being taken to. There was something sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	52634	52619	52667	Dorian	Which is the work of art, sir?" "This," replied [MASK], moving the screen back. "Can you move it, covering and all, just as it is? I don t want it to get scratched going upstairs."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	53030	53027	53082	Dorian	It appeared to [MASK] to have but little changed. There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy. There the satinwood book-case filled with his dog-eared schoolbooks.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	53644	53600	53646	Dorian	"Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don t want to have it hung up. Just lean it against the wall. Thanks." "Might one look at the work of art, sir?" [MASK] started.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	53789	53770	53815	Dorian	He had never seen any one so marvellous. When the sound of their footsteps had died away, [MASK] locked the door and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would ever look upon the horrible thing.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	59	53943	53916	53975	Victor	A copy of the third edition of _The St. James s Gazette_ had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that [MASK] had returned. He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	54351	54336	54387	Victor	And it was certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil. [MASK] might have read it. The man knew more than enough English for that. Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. And, yet, what did it matter?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	58	54980	54974	55032	Harry	"I am so sorry, [MASK]," he cried, "but really it is entirely your fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the time was going." "Yes, I thought you would like it," replied his host, rising from his chair.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	55042	54995	55043	Harry	That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the time was going." "Yes, I thought you would like it," replied his host, rising from his chair. "I didn t say I liked it, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	56121	56120	56167	Gautier	Like [MASK], he was one for whom "the visible world existed." And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	59049	59012	59059	Democritus	The bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm that could cure the plague. In the nests of Arabian birds was the aspilates, that, according to [MASK], kept the wearer from any danger by fire.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	59755	59701	59756	Athena	No winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom. How different it was with material things! Where had they passed to? Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of [MASK]?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	63729	63728	63774	Dorian	"[MASK]! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine o clock. Finally I took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	64013	64004	64047	Hallward	The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and [MASK] looked at his watch. "I have heaps of time," he answered. "The train doesn t go till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	64112	64112	64163	Dorian	[MASK] looked at him and smiled. "What a way for a fashionable painter to travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get into the house. And mind you don t talk about anything serious. Nothing is serious nowadays.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	64246	64200	64247	Dorian	The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little marqueterie table. "You see your servant made me quite at home, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	64295	64248	64299	Dorian	He gave me everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He is a most hospitable creature. I like him much better than the Frenchman you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?" [MASK] shrugged his shoulders.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	64514	64494	64544	Dorian	You make it so much more difficult for me." "What is it all about?" cried [MASK] in his petulant way, flinging himself down on the sofa. "I hope it is not about myself. I am tired of myself to-night.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	64562	64527	64577	Hallward	"I hope it is not about myself. I am tired of myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else." "It is about yourself," answered [MASK] in his grave deep voice, "and I must say it to you.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	64694	64688	64738	Dorian	"They must interest you, [MASK]. Every gentleman is interested in his good name. You don t want people to talk of you as something vile and degraded. Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all that kind of thing.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	64931	64908	64954	Dorian	I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him. His life is dreadful. But you, [MASK], with your pure, bright, innocent face, and your marvellous untroubled youth I can t believe anything against you.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	65091	65091	65136	Staveley	[MASK] curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes, but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	65326	65321	65369	Berwick	"You ask me why [MASK] leaves a room when I enter it. It is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows anything about mine. With such blood as he has in his veins, how could his record be clean?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	65675	65623	65678	Harry	You have filled them with a madness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them there. Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are smiling now. And there is worse behind. I know you and [MASK] are inseparable.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	65708	65679	65729	Basil	Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not have made his sister s name a by-word." "Take care, [MASK]. You go too far." "I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	65849	65810	65860	Dorian	Can they be true? When I first heard them, I laughed. I hear them now, and they make me shudder. What about your country-house and the life that is led there? [MASK], you don t know what is said about you.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	65878	65861	65907	Harry	I won t tell you that I don t want to preach to you. I remember [MASK] saying once that every man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and then proceeded to break his word.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	66467	66462	66508	Dorian	"This is blasphemy, [MASK]!" he cried. "You must not say things like that. They are horrible, and they don t mean anything." "You think so?" He laughed again. "I know so.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	66779	66776	66823	Basil	Come upstairs, [MASK]," he said quietly. "I keep a diary of my life from day to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall show it to you if you come with me."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	66831	66786	66837	Dorian	"I keep a diary of my life from day to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall show it to you if you come with me." "I shall come with you, [MASK], if you wish it.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	66966	66938	66986	Dorian	The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A rising wind made some of the windows rattle. When they reached the top landing, [MASK] set the lamp down on the floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	66993	66987	67042	Basil	"You insist on knowing, [MASK]?" he asked in a low voice. "Yes." "I am delighted," he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat harshly, "You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	67118	67072	67126	Hallward	A cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a flame of murky orange. He shuddered. "Shut the door behind you," he whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table. [MASK] glanced round him with a puzzled expression.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	67443	67439	67490	Dorian	Yes, it was [MASK] himself. But who had done it? He seemed to recognize his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the picture.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	67709	67661	67713	Hallward	There was simply the passion of the spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes. He had taken the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so. "What does this mean?" cried [MASK], at last.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	67963	67934	67982	Dorian	It has destroyed me." "I don t believe it is my picture." "Can t you see your ideal in it?" said [MASK] bitterly. "My ideal, as you call it..." "As you called it."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	68287	68266	68315	Dorian	" There was no answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window. "Pray, [MASK], pray," he murmured. "What is it that one was taught to say in one s boyhood? Lead us not into temptation.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	68409	68402	68449	Dorian	"It is never too late, [MASK]. Let us kneel down and try if we cannot remember a prayer. Isn t there a verse somewhere, Though your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow ?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	68461	68411	68462	Hush	Let us kneel down and try if we cannot remember a prayer. Isn t there a verse somewhere, Though your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow ?" "Those words mean nothing to me now." "[MASK]!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	68639	68596	68644	Hallward	He knew what it was. It was a knife that he had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had forgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly towards it, passing [MASK] as he did so.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	68660	68660	68705	Hallward	[MASK] stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise. He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear, crushing the man s head down on the table and stabbing again and again.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	69954	69918	69972	Dorian	Yes; that was the man he wanted. CHAPTER XIV. At nine o clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters. [MASK] was sleeping quite peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his cheek.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	70751	70734	70782	Lacenaire	As he turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of [MASK], the cold yellow hand "_du supplice encore mal lav e_," with its downy red hairs and its "_doigts de faune_."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	71284	71253	71308	Gautier	that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell of that curious statue that [MASK] compares to a contralto voice, the "_monstre charmant_" that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	72231	72207	72258	Gray	This is kind of you. I thank you for coming." "I had intended never to enter your house again, [MASK]. But you said it was a matter of life and death." His voice was hard and cold. He spoke with slow deliberation.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	72274	72253	72302	Dorian	He spoke with slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in the steady searching gaze that he turned on [MASK]. He kept his hands in the pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	72315	72276	72327	Alan	He kept his hands in the pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted. "Yes: it is a matter of life and death, [MASK], and to more than one person. Sit down."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	72489	72478	72526	Gray	What you have to do is this " "Stop, [MASK]. I don t want to know anything further. Whether what you have told me is true or not true doesn t concern me. I entirely decline to be mixed up in your life.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	72544	72500	72552	Alan	Whether what you have told me is true or not true doesn t concern me. I entirely decline to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself. They don t interest me any more." "[MASK], they will have to interest you.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	72568	72553	72603	Alan	This one will have to interest you. I am awfully sorry for you, [MASK]. But I can t help myself. You are the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the matter. I have no option.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	72604	72570	72619	Alan	But I can t help myself. You are the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the matter. I have no option. [MASK], you are scientific. You know about chemistry and things of that kind.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	72701	72676	72728	Alan	He will not be missed for months. When he is missed, there must be no trace of him found here. You, [MASK], you must change him, and everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the air."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	72748	72740	72792	Dorian	I was waiting for you to call me [MASK]." "You are mad, I tell you mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing to do with this matter, whatever it is.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	72826	72779	72828	Alan	I will have nothing to do with this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I am going to peril my reputation for you? What is it to me what devil s work you are up to?" "It was suicide, [MASK]."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	72995	72960	73015	Alan	Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you. You have come to the wrong man. Go to some of your friends. Don t come to me." "[MASK], it was murder. I killed him. You don t know what he had made me suffer.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	73036	73005	73056	Harry	You don t know what he had made me suffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the marring of it than poor [MASK] has had. He may not have intended it, the result was the same." "Murder!
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	73143	73109	73157	Alan	But I will have nothing to do with it." "You must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment; listen to me. Only listen, [MASK]. All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	73381	73362	73412	Alan	I am simply indifferent to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me." "[MASK], I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you came I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some day.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	73477	73433	73479	Alan	You don t inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from. Don t inquire now. I have told you too much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once, [MASK]."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	73545	73525	73572	Alan	If you don t come to my assistance, I am ruined. Why, they will hang me, [MASK]! Don t you understand? They will hang me for what I have done." "There is no good in prolonging this scene.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	73607	73563	73615	Alan	"There is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse to do anything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me." "You refuse?" "Yes." "I entreat you, [MASK]." "It is useless."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	73748	73714	73764	Dorian	A horrible sense of sickness came over him. He felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow. After two or three minutes of terrible silence, [MASK] turned round and came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	73773	73765	73814	Alan	"I am so sorry for you, [MASK]," he murmured, "but you leave me no alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the address. If you don t help me, I must send it.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	73911	73876	73925	Campbell	You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me no living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it is for me to dictate terms." [MASK] buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through him.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	73937	73926	73975	Alan	"Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, [MASK]. You know what they are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don t work yourself into this fever. The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	73980	73939	73988	Campbell	You know what they are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don t work yourself into this fever. The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it." A groan broke from [MASK] s lips and he shivered all over.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	74075	74062	74112	Alan	It was intolerable. It seemed to crush him. "Come, [MASK], you must decide at once." "I cannot do it," he said, mechanically, as though words could alter things. "You must. You have no choice.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	74166	74123	74174	Alan	"Is there a fire in the room upstairs?" "Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos." "I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory." "No, [MASK], you must not leave the house.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	42	74201	74175	74217	Campbell	Write out on a sheet of notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the things back to you." [MASK] scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope to his assistant.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	74262	74228	74281	Campbell	Then he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as soon as possible and to bring the things with him. As the hall door shut, [MASK] started nervously, and having got up from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	42	74732	74708	74750	Campbell	he said in a calm indifferent voice. The presence of a third person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage. [MASK] frowned and bit his lip. "It will take about five hours," he answered.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	74770	74739	74790	Francis	"It will take about five hours," he answered. "It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven, [MASK]. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can have the evening to yourself.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	74824	74783	74834	Alan	You can have the evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall not want you." "Thank you, sir," said the man, leaving the room. "Now, [MASK], there is not a moment to be lost.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	75194	75168	75217	Campbell	There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard [MASK] bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other things that he had required for his dreadful work.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	42	75278	75244	75286	Campbell	"Leave me now," said a stern voice behind him. He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been thrust back into the chair and that [MASK] was gazing into a glistening yellow face.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	75309	75287	75339	Campbell	As he was going downstairs, he heard the key being turned in the lock. It was long after seven when [MASK] came back into the library. He was pale, but absolutely calm. "I have done what you asked me to do," he muttered. "
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	75364	75316	75365	Alan	He was pale, but absolutely calm. "I have done what you asked me to do," he muttered. "And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again." "You have saved me from ruin, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	75805	75753	75808	Narborough	It is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the time. As it was, our bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody. However, that was all [MASK] s fault.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	75848	75832	75885	Dorian	Her guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she explained to [MASK], behind a very shabby fan, one of her married daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	76293	76288	76339	Harry	It was some consolation that [MASK] was to be there, and when the door opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored. But at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away untasted.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	76879	76830	76880	Dorian	She told me she didn t, because none of them had had any hearts at all." "Four husbands! Upon my word that is _trop de z le_." "_Trop d audace_, I tell her," said [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	77065	77021	77072	Dorian	"It is perfectly monstrous," he said, at last, "the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one s back that are absolutely and entirely true." "Isn t he incorrigible?" cried [MASK], leaning forward in his chair.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	77180	77139	77190	Narborough	When a woman marries again, it is because she detested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs." "[MASK] wasn t perfect," cried the old lady.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	78096	78066	78113	Harry	"Are you better, my dear fellow?" he asked. "You seemed rather out of sorts at dinner." "I am quite well, [MASK]. I am tired. That is all." "You were charming last night.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	78160	78155	78210	Harry	"Oh, yes, [MASK]." "He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is very clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image precious.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	78266	78225	78275	Dorian	White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the fire, and what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has had experiences." "How long has she been married?" asked [MASK]. "An eternity, she tells me.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	42	78293	78268	78310	Monmouth	"An eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage, it is ten years, but ten years with [MASK] must have been like eternity, with time thrown in. Who else is coming?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	78400	78350	78401	Harry	"A great many people don t, but I find him charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very modern type." "I don t know if he will be able to come, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	78436	78415	78463	Dorian	"Ah! what a nuisance people s people are! Try and make him come. By the way, [MASK], you ran off very early last night. You left before eleven. What did you do afterwards? Did you go straight home?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	78475	78472	78524	Harry	"No, [MASK]," he said at last, "I did not get home till nearly three." "Did you go to the club?" "Yes," he answered. Then he bit his lip. "No, I don t mean that.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	78548	78510	78560	Harry	Then he bit his lip. "No, I don t mean that. I didn t go to the club. I walked about. I forget what I did.... How inquisitive you are, [MASK]! You always want to know what one has been doing.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	78689	78668	78714	Harry	Tell me what it is. You are not yourself to-night." "Don t mind me, [MASK]. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall come round and see you to-morrow, or next day.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	78743	78722	78765	Dorian	I shan t go upstairs. I shall go home. I must go home." "All right, [MASK]. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time. The duchess is coming."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	78774	78760	78811	Harry	The duchess is coming." "I will try to be there, [MASK]," he said, leaving the room. As he drove back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he thought he had strangled had come back to him.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	79344	79302	79356	Dorian	He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address. The man shook his head. "It is too far for me," he muttered. "Here is a sovereign for you," said [MASK]. "You shall have another if you drive fast."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	80820	80789	80835	Dorian	The man looked at her in terror and began to whimper. At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a darkened chamber. As [MASK] hurried up its three rickety steps, the heavy odour of opium met him.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	80945	80937	80989	George	My brother paid the bill at last. [MASK] doesn t speak to me either.... I don t care," he added with a sigh. "As long as one has this stuff, one doesn t want friends. I think I have had too many friends."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	80990	80980	81025	Dorian	I think I have had too many friends." [MASK] winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	81179	81179	81229	Dorian	[MASK] shrugged his shoulders. "I am sick of women who love one. Women who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is better." "Much the same." "I like it better. Come and have something to drink.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	81494	81456	81510	Dorian	"I don t care to go back. What does it matter? I am quite happy here." "You will write to me if you want anything, won t you?" said [MASK], after a pause. "Perhaps." "Good night, then."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	81534	81500	81547	Dorian	"Perhaps." "Good night, then." "Good night," answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping his parched mouth with a handkerchief. [MASK] walked to the door with a look of pain in his face.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	82388	82383	82434	Dorian	That s all." [MASK] s arms fell to his side. Paralysed with terror, he did not know what to do. Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain. "Stop," he cried. "How long ago is it since your sister died?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	55	82759	82716	82771	Dorian	"I was deceived. A chance word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track." "You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into trouble," said [MASK], turning on his heel and going slowly down the street.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	83497	83494	83547	Gladys	"My dear [MASK], I would not alter either name for the world. They are both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday I cut an orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as effective as the seven deadly sins.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	83665	83619	83670	Harry	That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It is the only thing he is fit for." "Then what should we call you, [MASK]?" she asked.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	83729	83722	83769	Royalties	I refuse the title." "[MASK] may not abdicate," fell as a warning from pretty lips. "You wish me to defend my throne, then?" "Yes." "I give the truths of to-morrow."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	83789	83754	83801	Gladys	" "Yes." "I give the truths of to-morrow." "I prefer the mistakes of to-day," she answered. "You disarm me, [MASK]," he cried, catching the wilfulness of her mood.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	83839	83814	83858	Harry	" "I never tilt against beauty," he said, with a wave of his hand. "That is your error, [MASK], believe me. You value beauty far too much." "How can you say that?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	83943	83905	83956	Gladys	"Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?" cried the duchess. "What becomes of your simile about the orchid?" "Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, [MASK]. You, as a good Tory, must not underrate them.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	84142	84096	84144	Gladys	"They are more cunning than practical. When they make up their ledger, they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy." "Still, we have done great things." "Great things have been thrust on us, [MASK]."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	84196	84195	84245	Decay	"[MASK] fascinates me more." "What of art?" she asked. "It is a malady." "Love?" "An illusion." "Religion?" "The fashionable substitute for belief." "You are a sceptic."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	84279	84231	84281	Threads	"The fashionable substitute for belief." "You are a sceptic." "Never! Scepticism is the beginning of faith." "What are you?" "To define is to limit." "Give me a clue." "[MASK] snap.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	84360	84338	84379	Monmouth	"Our host is rather horrid this evening," answered the duchess, colouring. "I believe he thinks that [MASK] married me on purely scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern butterfly."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	84658	84605	84659	Dorian	I assure you we can t bear mediocrities. We women, as some one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if you ever love at all." "It seems to me that we never do anything else," murmured [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	84781	84738	84790	Harry	It merely intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible." "Even when one has been wounded by it, [MASK]?" asked the duchess after a pause.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	85300	85288	85337	Gladys	"Ah! you must suit your frock to his flowers, [MASK]." "That would be a premature surrender." "Romantic art begins with its climax." "I must keep an opportunity for retreat." "In the Parthian manner?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	86483	86445	86488	Geoffrey	He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take the mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken and rough undergrowth. "Have you had good sport, [MASK]?" he asked.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	57	86526	86526	86583	Dorian	[MASK] strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	86692	86688	86740	Dorian	"What nonsense, [MASK]!" laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded into the thicket, he fired. There were two cries heard, the cry of a hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is worse.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	86866	86866	86917	Dorian	[MASK] watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the lithe swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging a body after them into the sunlight. He turned away in horror. It seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	87055	87036	87083	Harry	It would not look well to go on." "I wish it were stopped for ever, [MASK]," he answered bitterly. "The whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man ...?" He could not finish the sentence.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	87228	87187	87240	Geoffrey	My dear fellow, it can t be helped. It was the man s own fault. Why did he get in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is rather awkward for [MASK], of course. It does not do to pepper beaters.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	87285	87278	87323	Harry	"It is a bad omen, [MASK]. I feel as if something horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself, perhaps," he added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	87342	87302	87355	Dorian	To myself, perhaps," he added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain. The elder man laughed. "The only horrible thing in the world is _ennui_, [MASK]. That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	87401	87356	87407	Destiny	But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed. As for omens, there is no such thing as an omen. [MASK] does not send us heralds.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	87428	87408	87457	Dorian	She is too wise or too cruel for that. Besides, what on earth could happen to you, [MASK]? You have everything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	87471	87430	87478	Harry	You have everything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you." "There is no one with whom I would not change places, [MASK]. Don t laugh like that.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	58	87632	87586	87644	Dorian	I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow! You must come and see my doctor, when we get back to town." [MASK] heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	87787	87744	87798	Harry	"It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on." "How fond you are of saying dangerous things, [MASK]! In the present instance, you are quite astray.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	54	87842	87799	87853	Harry	I like the duchess very much, but I don t love her." "And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you are excellently matched." "You are talking scandal, [MASK], and there is never any basis for scandal."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	88044	88021	88070	Harry	Why not tell me what it is? You know I would help you." "I can t tell you, [MASK]," he answered sadly. "And I dare say it is only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	88115	88071	88122	Artemis	I have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me." "What nonsense!" "I hope it is, but I can t help feeling it. Ah! here is the duchess, looking like [MASK] in a tailor-made gown.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	88361	88346	88395	Harry	I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didn t hear what [MASK] said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some other time. I think I must go and lie down. You will excuse me, won t you?"
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	88601	88590	88640	Monmouth	"I will not part with a petal." "[MASK] has ears." "Old age is dull of hearing." "Has he never been jealous?" "I wish he had been." He glanced about as if in search of something.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	42	88964	88936	88978	Dorian	He frowned and bit his lip. "Send him in," he muttered, after some moments hesitation. As soon as the man entered, [MASK] pulled his chequebook out of a drawer and spread it out before him.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	88993	88979	89020	Thornton	"I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning, [MASK]?" he said, taking up a pen. "Yes, sir," answered the gamekeeper. "Was the poor fellow married?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	89031	89014	89064	Dorian	"Was the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on him?" asked [MASK], looking bored. "If so, I should not like them to be left in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	89100	89076	89128	Dorian	That is what I took the liberty of coming to you about." "Don t know who he is?" said [MASK], listlessly. "What do you mean? Wasn t he one of your men?" "No, sir. Never saw him before.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	89214	89175	89226	Dorian	"Yes, sir. He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on both arms, and that kind of thing." "Was there anything found on him?" said [MASK], leaning forward and looking at the man with startled eyes.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	89279	89258	89308	Dorian	A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of sailor we think." [MASK] started to his feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him. He clutched at it madly. "Where is the body?" he exclaimed. "
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	89867	89838	89879	Harry	I am not going to do any more. I began my good actions yesterday." "Where were you yesterday?" "In the country, [MASK]. I was staying at a little inn by myself."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	46	89981	89936	89982	Dorian	There are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they stagnate." "Culture and corruption," echoed [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	90012	89991	90039	Harry	It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together. For I have a new ideal, [MASK]. I am going to alter. I think I have altered." "You have not yet told me what your good action was.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	90091	90040	90092	Harry	Or did you say you had done more than one?" asked his companion as he spilled into his plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a perforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them. "I can tell you, [MASK].
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	90159	90151	90194	Hetty	How long ago that seems! Well, [MASK] was not one of our own class, of course. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her. I am quite sure that I loved her.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	90329	90299	90342	Harry	"But I can finish your idyll for you. You gave her good advice and broke her heart. That was the beginning of your reformation." "[MASK], you are horrible! You mustn t say these dreadful things.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	90409	90406	90454	Dorian	"My dear [MASK], you have the most curiously boyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really content now with any one of her own rank? I suppose she will be married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	90552	90545	90595	Harry	"I can t bear this, [MASK]! You mock at everything, and then suggest the most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don t care what you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	90963	90954	91004	Basil	"I have not the slightest idea. If [MASK] chooses to hide himself, it is no business of mine. If he is dead, I don t want to think about him. Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	91160	91148	91196	Dorian	They are such an essential part of one s personality." [MASK] said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white and black ivory of the keys.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	41	91282	91249	91290	Velasquez	Why should he have been murdered? He was not clever enough to have enemies. Of course, he had a wonderful genius for painting. But a man can paint like [MASK] and yet be as dull as possible.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	42	91291	91291	91333	Basil	[MASK] was really rather dull. He only interested me once, and that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	91495	91489	91539	Dorian	It is not in you, [MASK], to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders. I don t blame them in the smallest degree.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	91666	91660	91710	Basil	But let us pass from poor [MASK]. I wish I could believe that he had come to such a really romantic end as you suggest, but I can t. I dare say he fell into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	92035	92018	92067	Basil	I remember I wanted to buy it. I wish I had now. It belonged to [MASK] s best period. Since then, his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative British artist.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	92084	92040	92091	Dorian	Since then, his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative British artist. Did you advertise for it? You should." "I forget," said [MASK]. "I suppose I did.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	92253	92233	92282	Dorian	The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes. "By the way, [MASK]," he said after a pause, " what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose how does the quotation run?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	92505	92501	92549	Harry	"Don t, [MASK]. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is a soul in each one of us. I know it."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	92559	92526	92576	Dorian	It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is a soul in each one of us. I know it." "Do you feel quite sure of that, [MASK]?" "Quite sure." "Ah! then it must be an illusion.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	92647	92626	92675	Dorian	No: we have given up our belief in the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne, [MASK], and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your youth. You must have some secret.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	92702	92676	92727	Dorian	I am only ten years older than you are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are really wonderful, [MASK]. You have never looked more charming than you do to-night. You remind me of the day I saw you first.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	92831	92788	92839	Life	There is nothing like it. It s absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in front of me. [MASK] has revealed to them her latest wonder.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	52	92977	92929	92981	Marsyas	It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that is not imitative! Don t stop. I want music to-night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I am [MASK] listening to you.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	43	92986	92982	93025	Dorian	I have sorrows, [MASK], of my own, that even you know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young. I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	93028	92999	93049	Dorian	The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young. I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity. Ah, [MASK], how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had! You have drunk deeply of everything.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	93101	93087	93137	Harry	You are still the same." "I am not the same, [MASK]." "Yes, you are the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will be. Don t spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	93164	93130	93179	Dorian	At present you are a perfect type. Don t make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need not shake your head: you know you are. Besides, [MASK], don t deceive yourself. Life is not governed by will or intention.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	93291	93291	93336	Browning	[MASK] writes about that somewhere; but our own senses will imagine them for us. There are moments when the odour of _lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the strangest month of my life over again.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	53	93346	93337	93390	Dorian	I wish I could change places with you, [MASK]. The world has cried out against us both, but it has always worshipped you. It always will worship you. You are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	93477	93453	93497	Harry	"Yes, life has been exquisite," he murmured, "but I am not going to have the same life, [MASK]. And you must not say these extravagant things to me. You don t know everything about me.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	93527	93479	93528	Dorian	And you must not say these extravagant things to me. You don t know everything about me. I think that if you did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don t laugh." "Why have you stopped playing, [MASK]?
ThePictureOfDorianGray	44	93661	93625	93669	Dorian	He has already copied your neckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you. He is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you." "I hope not," said [MASK] with a sad look in his eyes.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	48	93679	93670	93718	Harry	"But I am tired to-night, [MASK]. I shan t go to the club. It is nearly eleven, and I want to go to bed early." "Do stay. You have never played so well as to-night.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	47	93810	93794	93841	Harry	"Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. [MASK], promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm." "My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	50	94041	94019	94069	Gladys	Or shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she never sees you now. Perhaps you are tired of [MASK]? I thought you would be. Her clever tongue gets on one s nerves. Well, in any case, be here at eleven."
ThePictureOfDorianGray	51	94076	94058	94109	Harry	Well, in any case, be here at eleven." "Must I really come, [MASK]?" "Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don t think there have been such lilacs since the year I met you." "Very well.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	45	95039	95023	95068	Basil	He could not forgive him that. It was the portrait that had done everything. [MASK] had said things to him that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The murder had been simply the madness of a moment.
ThePictureOfDorianGray	49	96146	96107	96156	Constable	Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all dark. After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and watched. "Whose house is that, [MASK]?" asked the elder of the two gentlemen.
