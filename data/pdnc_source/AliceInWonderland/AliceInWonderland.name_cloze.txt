AliceInWonderland	43	357	334	377	Alice	The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that [MASK] had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
AliceInWonderland	57	542	537	594	Alice	"Well!" thought [MASK] to herself, "after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!"
AliceInWonderland	46	749	725	771	Alice	--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?" ([MASK] had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
AliceInWonderland	52	951	905	957	Alice	And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere." Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so [MASK] soon began talking again. "
AliceInWonderland	52	994	994	1046	Dinah	[MASK] my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?"
AliceInWonderland	54	1049	1037	1091	Alice	But do cats eat bats, I wonder?" And here [MASK] began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, "Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?" and sometimes, "Do bats eat cats?"
AliceInWonderland	49	1190	1190	1239	Alice	[MASK] was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
AliceInWonderland	45	1251	1240	1285	Alice	There was not a moment to be lost: away went [MASK] like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, "Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!"
AliceInWonderland	50	1347	1331	1381	Alice	There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when [MASK] had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
AliceInWonderland	47	2837	2805	2852	Alice	I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to them," thought [MASK], "or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!
AliceInWonderland	50	3285	3285	3335	Alice	[MASK] took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: "Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
AliceInWonderland	50	3816	3793	3843	Mabel	oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm [MASK], I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying 'Come up again, dear!'
AliceInWonderland	42	3896	3889	3931	Alice	else'--but, oh dear!" cried [MASK], with a sudden burst of tears, "I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so _very_ tired of being all alone here!"
AliceInWonderland	55	4072	4061	4116	Alice	"That _was_ a narrow escape!" said [MASK], a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; "and now for the garden!" and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas!
AliceInWonderland	50	4337	4300	4350	Alice	However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. "I wish I hadn't cried so much!" said [MASK], as she swam about, trying to find her way out.
AliceInWonderland	54	4472	4460	4514	Alice	"Would it be of any use, now," thought [MASK], "to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.
AliceInWonderland	55	4548	4547	4602	Alice	([MASK] thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, "A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!")
AliceInWonderland	48	4668	4658	4706	Alice	(For, with all her knowledge of history, [MASK] had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: "O? est ma chatte?" which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.
AliceInWonderland	45	5023	4990	5035	Alice	Our family always _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!" "I won't indeed!" said [MASK], in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation.
AliceInWonderland	58	5366	5321	5379	Alice	It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. [MASK] led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
AliceInWonderland	48	5461	5431	5479	Alice	The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to [MASK] to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.
AliceInWonderland	52	6483	6476	6528	Alice	, "Prizes! Prizes!" [MASK] had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.
AliceInWonderland	43	6784	6770	6813	Alice	"You promised to tell me your history, you know," said [MASK], "and why it is you hate--C and D," she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.
AliceInWonderland	44	7177	7167	7211	Alice	"Please come back and finish your story!" [MASK] called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, "Yes, please do!" but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
AliceInWonderland	41	7521	7514	7555	Dinah	"I wish I hadn't mentioned [MASK]!" she said to herself in a melancholy tone. "Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!
AliceInWonderland	49	7560	7524	7573	Dinah	she said to herself in a melancholy tone. "Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear [MASK]! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!"
AliceInWonderland	50	7854	7848	7898	Alice	Quick, now!" And [MASK] was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. "He took me for his housemaid," she said to herself as she ran.
AliceInWonderland	53	8500	8498	8551	Alice	Luckily for [MASK], the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
AliceInWonderland	47	8721	8715	8762	Alice	"But then," thought [MASK], "shall I _never_ get any older than I am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn!
AliceInWonderland	48	8779	8737	8785	Alice	That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like _that!_" "Oh, you foolish [MASK]!" she answered herself.
AliceInWonderland	46	8890	8890	8936	Alice	[MASK] knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
AliceInWonderland	42	9006	8996	9038	Alice	"_That_ you won't!" thought [MASK], and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.
AliceInWonderland	59	9097	9039	9098	Pat	She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--"Pat! [MASK]!
AliceInWonderland	49	9169	9164	9213	Pat	"Now tell me, [MASK], what's that in the window?" "Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!" (He pronounced it "arrum.") "An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size?
AliceInWonderland	50	9272	9263	9313	Alice	There was a long silence after this, and [MASK] could only hear whispers now and then; such as, "Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at all!" "Do as I tell you, you coward!"
AliceInWonderland	50	9363	9314	9364	Alice	and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were _two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. "What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!" thought [MASK].
AliceInWonderland	53	9512	9481	9534	Bill	No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--Here, [MASK]! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!
AliceInWonderland	52	9548	9520	9572	Bill	Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!" (a loud crash)--"Now, who did that?--It was [MASK], I fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ shan't! _You_ do it!--_That_
AliceInWonderland	48	9585	9553	9601	Bill	Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ shan't! _You_ do it!--_That_ I won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, [MASK]! the master says you're to go down the chimney!" "Oh!
AliceInWonderland	45	10012	10002	10047	Alice	"A barrowful of _what?_" thought [MASK]; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.
AliceInWonderland	47	10287	10275	10322	Alice	"The first thing I've got to do," said [MASK] to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.
AliceInWonderland	57	10427	10421	10478	Alice	Poor little thing!" said [MASK], in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.
AliceInWonderland	44	10686	10683	10727	Alice	This seemed to [MASK] a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance. "
AliceInWonderland	57	10740	10728	10785	Alice	And yet what a dear little puppy it was!" said [MASK], as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: "I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!
AliceInWonderland	41	10844	10836	10877	Alice	The great question certainly was, what? [MASK] looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
AliceInWonderland	48	11054	11054	11102	Alice	[MASK] replied, rather shyly, "I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then."
AliceInWonderland	43	11176	11163	11206	Alice	"I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," [MASK] replied very politely, "for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing."
AliceInWonderland	58	11231	11217	11275	Alice	"Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said [MASK]; "but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little queer, won't you?"
AliceInWonderland	50	11408	11392	11442	Alice	"Why?" said the Caterpillar. Here was another puzzling question; and as [MASK] could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away. "Come back!"
AliceInWonderland	42	11464	11438	11480	Alice	"Come back!" the Caterpillar called after her. "I've something important to say!" This sounded promising, certainly: [MASK] turned and came back again. "Keep your temper," said the Caterpillar.
AliceInWonderland	50	12071	12034	12084	Alice	Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!" "That is not said right," said the Caterpillar. "Not _quite_ right, I'm afraid," said [MASK], timidly; "some of the words have got altered."
AliceInWonderland	55	12141	12116	12171	Alice	"What size do you want to be?" it asked. "Oh, I'm not particular as to size," [MASK] hastily replied; "only one doesn't like changing so often, you know." "I _don't_ know," said the Caterpillar.
AliceInWonderland	47	12289	12247	12294	Alice	"It is a very good height indeed!" said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). "But I'm not used to it!" pleaded poor [MASK] in a piteous tone.
AliceInWonderland	41	12775	12762	12803	Alice	"What _can_ all that green stuff be?" said [MASK]. "And where _have_ my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?
AliceInWonderland	53	13034	13019	13072	Alice	"I haven't the least idea what you're talking about," said [MASK]. "I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges," the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; "but those serpents!
AliceInWonderland	51	13247	13231	13282	Alice	"But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!" said [MASK]. "I'm a--I'm a--" "Well! _What_ are you?" said the Pigeon. "I can see you're trying to invent something!"
AliceInWonderland	50	13293	13261	13311	Alice	What_ are you?" said the Pigeon. "I can see you're trying to invent something!" "I--I'm a little girl," said [MASK], rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.
AliceInWonderland	52	13400	13372	13424	Alice	I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!" "I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly," said [MASK], who was a very truthful child; "but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.
AliceInWonderland	49	13536	13523	13572	Alice	"It matters a good deal to _me_," said [MASK] hastily; "but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want _yours_: I don't like them raw."
AliceInWonderland	59	13834	13802	13861	Alice	" As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. "Whoever lives there," thought [MASK], "it'll never do to come upon them _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!"
AliceInWonderland	46	14300	14293	14339	Alice	"Please, then," said [MASK], "how am I to get in?" "There might be some sense in your knocking," the Footman went on without attending to her, "if we had the door between us.
AliceInWonderland	52	14381	14364	14416	Alice	" He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this [MASK] thought decidedly uncivil. "But perhaps he can't help it," she said to herself; "his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his head.
AliceInWonderland	56	14528	14495	14551	Alice	"--or next day, maybe," the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened. "How am I to get in?" asked [MASK] again, in a louder tone. "_Are_ you to get in at all?" said the Footman.
AliceInWonderland	46	14570	14552	14598	Alice	"That's the first question, you know." It was, no doubt: only [MASK] did not like to be told so. "It's really dreadful," she muttered to herself, "the way all the creatures argue.
AliceInWonderland	51	14658	14608	14659	Alice	The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. "I shall sit here," he said, "on and off, for days and days." "But what am _I_ to do?" said [MASK].
AliceInWonderland	46	14688	14660	14706	Alice	"Anything you like," said the Footman, and began whistling. "Oh, there's no use in talking to him," said [MASK] desperately: "he's perfectly idiotic!" And she opened the door and went in.
AliceInWonderland	58	14867	14858	14916	Alice	"Please would you tell me," said [MASK], a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, "why your cat grins like that?" "It's a Cheshire cat," said the Duchess, "and that's why.
AliceInWonderland	45	15017	15006	15051	Alice	"I don't know of any that do," [MASK] said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. "You don't know much," said the Duchess; "and that's a fact."
AliceInWonderland	46	15052	15032	15078	Alice	"You don't know much," said the Duchess; "and that's a fact." [MASK] did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.
AliceInWonderland	54	15187	15173	15227	Alice	"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!" cried [MASK], jumping up and down in an agony of terror. "Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!" as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.
AliceInWonderland	45	15271	15259	15304	Alice	"Which would _not_ be an advantage," said [MASK], who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. "Just think of what work it would make with the day and night!
AliceInWonderland	55	15338	15338	15393	Alice	[MASK] glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: "Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or is it twelve?
AliceInWonderland	50	15533	15503	15553	Alice	While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that [MASK] could hardly hear the words:-- "I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes;
AliceInWonderland	51	15595	15554	15605	Alice	For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!" CHORUS. "Wow! wow! wow!" "Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!" the Duchess said to [MASK], flinging the baby at her as she spoke.
AliceInWonderland	48	15871	15838	15886	Alice	She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). "Don't grunt," said [MASK]; "that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself."
AliceInWonderland	50	15948	15909	15959	Alice	There could be no doubt that it had a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether [MASK] did not like the look of the thing at all.
AliceInWonderland	53	16057	16029	16082	Alice	The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence. [MASK] was just beginning to think to herself, "Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?
AliceInWonderland	53	16347	16337	16390	Alice	Come, it's pleased so far," thought [MASK], and she went on. "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
AliceInWonderland	47	16400	16354	16401	Alice	"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat. "I don't much care where--" said [MASK].
AliceInWonderland	48	16459	16435	16483	Alice	"Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long enough." [MASK] felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. "What sort of people live about here?"
AliceInWonderland	51	16550	16526	16577	Alice	Visit either you like: they're both mad." "But I don't want to go among mad people," [MASK] remarked. "Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here. I'm mad.
AliceInWonderland	42	16594	16553	16595	Alice	"Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad." "How do you know I'm mad?" said [MASK].
AliceInWonderland	52	16744	16706	16758	Alice	Now _I_ growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad." "_I_ call it purring, not growling," said [MASK]. "Call it what you like," said the Cat. "
AliceInWonderland	45	16781	16746	16791	Alice	"Call it what you like," said the Cat. "Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?" "I should like it very much," said [MASK], "but I haven't been invited yet.
AliceInWonderland	50	16808	16792	16842	Alice	" "You'll see me there," said the Cat, and vanished. [MASK] was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.
AliceInWonderland	50	16878	16843	16893	Alice	"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?" said the Cat. "I'd nearly forgotten to ask." "It turned into a pig," [MASK] quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.
AliceInWonderland	54	16909	16894	16948	Alice	"I thought it would," said the Cat, and vanished again. [MASK] waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live.
AliceInWonderland	46	17722	17701	17747	Alice	"Then you should say what you mean," the March Hare went on. "I do," [MASK] hastily replied; "at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know."
AliceInWonderland	47	17948	17933	17980	Alice	"What day of the month is it?" he said, turning to [MASK]: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.
AliceInWonderland	50	18129	18129	18179	Alice	[MASK] had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. "What a funny watch!" she remarked. "It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!" "Why should it?" muttered the Hatter. "
AliceInWonderland	47	18651	18621	18668	Alice	("I only wish it was," the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.) "That would be grand, certainly," said [MASK] thoughtfully: "but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.
AliceInWonderland	53	18812	18794	18847	Alice	You know the song, perhaps?" "I've heard something like it," said [MASK]. "It goes on, you know," the Hatter continued, "in this way:-- 'Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.
AliceInWonderland	49	18938	18924	18973	Alice	Off with his head!'" "How dreadfully savage!" exclaimed [MASK]. "And ever since that," the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, "he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now."
AliceInWonderland	42	18979	18940	18982	Alice	"And ever since that," the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, "he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now." A bright idea came into [MASK]'s head.
AliceInWonderland	50	19134	19103	19153	Alice	"I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story." "I'm afraid I don't know one," said [MASK], rather alarmed at the proposal. "Then the Dormouse shall!" they both cried. "
AliceInWonderland	41	19347	19317	19358	Alice	"They lived on treacle," said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. "They couldn't have done that, you know," [MASK] gently remarked; "they'd have been ill."
AliceInWonderland	42	19376	19376	19418	Alice	[MASK] tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: "But why did they live at the bottom of a well?"
AliceInWonderland	56	19787	19741	19797	Alice	"I want a clean cup," interrupted the Hatter: "let's all move one place on." He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and [MASK] rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.
AliceInWonderland	42	20249	20234	20276	Alice	"At any rate I'll never go _there_ again!" said [MASK] as she picked her way through the wood. "It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!"
AliceInWonderland	48	20594	20575	20623	Five	Always lay the blame on others!" "_You'd_ better not talk!" said [MASK]. "I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!" "What for?" said the one who had spoken first.
AliceInWonderland	54	21153	21136	21190	Alice	So she stood still where she was, and waited. When the procession came opposite to [MASK], they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely "Who is this?" She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
AliceInWonderland	48	21208	21174	21222	Alice	She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. "Idiot!" said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to [MASK], she went on, "What's your name, child?"
AliceInWonderland	56	21358	21348	21404	Alice	"How should _I_ know?" said [MASK], surprised at her own courage. "It's no business of _mine_." The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed "Off with her head!
AliceInWonderland	47	21412	21377	21424	Alice	The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed "Off with her head! Off--" "Nonsense!" said [MASK], very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.
AliceInWonderland	48	21656	21647	21695	Alice	"You shan't be beheaded!" said [MASK], and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.
AliceInWonderland	54	21751	21707	21761	Alice	"Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!" the soldiers shouted in reply. "That's right!" shouted the Queen. "Can you play croquet?" The soldiers were silent, and looked at [MASK], as the question was evidently meant for her.
AliceInWonderland	43	21781	21769	21812	Alice	"Come on, then!" roared the Queen, and [MASK] joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next. "It's--it's a very fine day!" said a timid voice at her side.
AliceInWonderland	51	21834	21794	21845	Alice	"It's--it's a very fine day!" said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. "Very," said [MASK]: "--where's the Duchess?" "Hush!
AliceInWonderland	54	21901	21859	21913	Alice	He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered "She's under sentence of execution." "What for?" said [MASK]. "Did you say 'What a pity!'?
AliceInWonderland	47	21928	21914	21961	Alice	" the Rabbit asked. "No, I didn't," said [MASK]: "I don't think it's at all a pity. I said 'What for?'" "She boxed the Queen's ears--" the Rabbit began.
AliceInWonderland	55	22052	22052	22107	Alice	[MASK] thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
AliceInWonderland	49	22777	22770	22819	Alice	"Not at all," said [MASK]: "she's so extremely--" Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, "--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game."
AliceInWonderland	52	22871	22857	22909	Alice	"It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat," said [MASK]: "allow me to introduce it." "I don't like the look of it at all," said the King: "however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.
AliceInWonderland	41	22947	22910	22951	Alice	" "I'd rather not," the Cat remarked. "Don't be impertinent," said the King, "and don't look at me like that!" He got behind [MASK] as he spoke.
AliceInWonderland	51	23073	23054	23105	Alice	"I'll fetch the executioner myself," said the King eagerly, and he hurried off. [MASK] thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with passion.
AliceInWonderland	48	23946	23914	23962	Alice	I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit." "Perhaps it hasn't one," [MASK] ventured to remark. "Tut, tut, child!" said the Duchess.
AliceInWonderland	55	24125	24085	24140	Alice	"'Tis so," said the Duchess: "and the moral of that is--'Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!'" "Somebody said," [MASK] whispered, "that it's done by everybody minding their own business!"
AliceInWonderland	48	24164	24146	24194	Alice	It means much the same thing," said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into [MASK]'s shoulder as she added, "and the moral of _that_ is--'Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.'
AliceInWonderland	53	24208	24208	24261	Alice	[MASK] thought to herself. "I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist," the Duchess said after a pause: "the reason is, that I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?"
AliceInWonderland	43	24268	24255	24298	Alice	Shall I try the experiment?" "He might bite," [MASK] cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried. "Very true," said the Duchess: "flamingoes and mustard both bite.
AliceInWonderland	48	24322	24299	24347	Alice	And the moral of that is--'Birds of a feather flock together.'" "Only mustard isn't a bird," [MASK] remarked. "Right, as usual," said the Duchess: "what a clear way you have of putting things!"
AliceInWonderland	45	24425	24396	24441	Alice	And the moral of that is--'The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.'" "Oh, I know!" exclaimed [MASK], who had not attended to this last remark, "it's a vegetable.
AliceInWonderland	54	24602	24563	24617	Alice	"That's nothing to what I could say if I chose," the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone. "Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that," said [MASK]. "Oh, don't talk about trouble!" said the Duchess.
AliceInWonderland	50	24642	24618	24668	Alice	"I make you a present of everything I've said as yet." "A cheap sort of present!" thought [MASK]. "I'm glad they don't give birthday presents like that!" But she did not venture to say it out loud.
AliceInWonderland	51	24697	24658	24709	Alice	But she did not venture to say it out loud. "Thinking again?" the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin. "I've a right to think," said [MASK] sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.
AliceInWonderland	56	24737	24716	24772	Alice	," said the Duchess, "as pigs have to fly; and the m--" But here, to [MASK]'s great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.
AliceInWonderland	42	24773	24773	24815	Alice	[MASK] looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. "A fine day, your Majesty!" the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
AliceInWonderland	48	25166	25139	25187	Alice	"Come on, then," said the Queen, "and he shall tell you his history," As they walked off together, [MASK] heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, "You are all pardoned."
AliceInWonderland	56	25446	25413	25469	Alice	"It's all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!" "Everybody says 'come on!' here," thought [MASK], as she went slowly after it: "I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!"
AliceInWonderland	41	25668	25656	25697	Alice	So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. [MASK] thought to herself, "I don't see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn't begin." But she waited patiently.
AliceInWonderland	43	25757	25757	25800	Alice	[MASK] was very nearly getting up and saying, "Thank you, sir, for your interesting story," but she could not help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.
AliceInWonderland	46	25997	25952	25998	Alice	Don't be all day about it!" and he went on in these words: "Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--" "I never said I didn't!" interrupted [MASK].
AliceInWonderland	47	26065	26031	26078	Alice	"We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--" "_I've_ been to a day-school, too," said [MASK]; "you needn't be so proud as all that."
AliceInWonderland	48	26187	26150	26198	Alice	"Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill, 'French, music, _and washing_--extra.'" "You couldn't have wanted it much," said [MASK]; "living at the bottom of the sea."
AliceInWonderland	44	26332	26303	26347	Alice	"What! Never heard of uglifying!" it exclaimed. "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?" "Yes," said [MASK] doubtfully: "it means--to--make--anything--prettier."
AliceInWonderland	47	26700	26668	26715	Alice	"That's the reason they're called lessons," the Gryphon remarked: "because they lessen from day to day." This was quite a new idea to [MASK], and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark.
AliceInWonderland	47	26751	26740	26787	Alice	"And how did you manage on the twelfth?" [MASK] went on eagerly. "That's enough about lessons," the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: "tell her something about the games now." CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille
AliceInWonderland	48	27956	27926	27974	Alice	So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all." "Thank you," said [MASK], "it's very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before."
AliceInWonderland	47	28151	28137	28184	Alice	Now you know." "And what are they made of?" [MASK] asked in a tone of great curiosity. "Soles and eels, of course," the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: "any shrimp could have told you that."
AliceInWonderland	46	28195	28185	28231	Alice	"If I'd been the whiting," said [MASK], whose thoughts were still running on the song, "I'd have said to the porpoise, 'Keep back, please: we don't want _you_ with us!'
AliceInWonderland	45	28978	28951	28996	Alice	"How _could_ he turn them out with his nose, you know?" "It's the first position in dancing." [MASK] said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
AliceInWonderland	53	29428	29380	29433	Pennyworth	Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!" "Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish? Who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful Soup? [MASK] only of beautiful Soup?
AliceInWonderland	53	29891	29881	29934	Alice	And that's the jury-box," thought [MASK], "and those twelve creatures," (she was obliged to say "creatures," you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) "I suppose they are the jurors."
AliceInWonderland	42	30211	30197	30239	Alice	One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, [MASK] could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.
AliceInWonderland	46	30909	30872	30918	Alice	"I wish you wouldn't squeeze so." said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. "I can hardly breathe." "I can't help it," said [MASK] very meekly: "I'm growing."
AliceInWonderland	48	31658	31620	31668	Alice	"Then you may _sit_ down," the King replied. Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed. "Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!" thought [MASK]. "Now we shall get on better."
AliceInWonderland	58	31791	31760	31818	Alice	"Call the next witness!" said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and [MASK] guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
AliceInWonderland	52	32823	32789	32841	Alice	"You are," said the King. "Nearly two miles high," added the Queen. "Well, I shan't go, at any rate," said [MASK]: "besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now."
AliceInWonderland	48	33280	33233	33281	Alice	There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day. "That _proves_ his guilt," said the Queen. "It proves nothing of the sort!" said [MASK].
AliceInWonderland	59	33880	33822	33881	Alice	We know it to be true_--' that's the jury, of course--'_I gave her one, they gave him two_--' why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--" "But, it goes on '_they all returned from him to you_,'" said [MASK].
AliceInWonderland	50	34101	34076	34126	Alice	"No, no!" said the Queen. "Sentence first--verdict afterwards." "Stuff and nonsense!" said [MASK] loudly. "The idea of having the sentence first!" "Hold your tongue!" said the Queen, turning purple.
AliceInWonderland	50	34134	34105	34155	Alice	The idea of having the sentence first!" "Hold your tongue!" said the Queen, turning purple. "I won't!" said [MASK]. "Off with her head!" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.
AliceInWonderland	53	34164	34136	34189	Alice	"Off with her head!" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. "Who cares for you?" said [MASK], (she had grown to her full size by this time.) "You're nothing but a pack of cards!"
