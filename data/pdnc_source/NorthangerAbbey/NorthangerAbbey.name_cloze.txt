NorthangerAbbey	53	76	53	106	Richard	Her father was a clergyman, without being neglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his name was [MASK] and he had never been handsome. He had a considerable independence besides two good livings and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters.
NorthangerAbbey	50	139	134	184	Catherine	She had three sons before [MASK] was born; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might expect, she still lived on lived to have six children more to see them growing up around her, and to enjoy excellent health herself.
NorthangerAbbey	45	1219	1176	1221	Grief	That "The poor beetle, which we tread upon, In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great As when a giant dies." And that a young woman in love always looks "like Patience on a monument Smiling at [MASK]."
NorthangerAbbey	53	1914	1910	1963	Catherine	"I beg, [MASK], you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat, when you come from the rooms at night; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend; I will give you this little book on purpose."
NorthangerAbbey	48	2239	2239	2287	Catherine	[MASK] was all eager delight her eyes were here, there, everywhere, as they approached its fine and striking environs, and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel. She was come to be happy, and she felt happy already.
NorthangerAbbey	41	3087	3058	3099	Catherine	" For some time her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes; but they were repeated so often, and proved so totally ineffectual, that [MASK] grew tired at last, and would thank her no more.
NorthangerAbbey	48	3369	3332	3380	Catherine	It is such a delicate muslin. For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room, I assure you." "How uncomfortable it is," whispered [MASK], "not to have a single acquaintance here!"
NorthangerAbbey	51	4335	4290	4341	Catherine	He seemed to be about four or five and twenty, was rather tall, had a pleasing countenance, a very intelligent and lively eye, and, if not quite handsome, was very near it. His address was good, and [MASK] felt herself in high luck.
NorthangerAbbey	49	4580	4537	4586	Catherine	Then forming his features into a set smile, and affectedly softening his voice, he added, with a simpering air, "Have you been long in Bath, madam?" "About a week, sir," replied [MASK], trying not to laugh.
NorthangerAbbey	50	4766	4730	4780	Catherine	"And are you altogether pleased with Bath?" "Yes I like it very well." "Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again." [MASK] turned away her head, not knowing whether she might venture to laugh.
NorthangerAbbey	57	5642	5600	5657	Catherine	"It is very pretty, madam," said he, gravely examining it; "but I do not think it will wash well; I am afraid it will fray." "How can you," said [MASK], laughing, "be so " She had almost said "strange."
NorthangerAbbey	41	5963	5963	6004	Catherine	[MASK] coloured, and said, "I was not thinking of anything." "That is artful and deep, to be sure; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me."
NorthangerAbbey	50	8173	8141	8191	Catherine	Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be so short! This sort of mysteriousness, which is always so becoming in a hero, threw a fresh grace in [MASK] s imagination around his person and manners, and increased her anxiety to know more of him.
NorthangerAbbey	51	9035	8989	9040	Miss	"I am no novel-reader I seldom look into novels Do not imagine that _I_ often read novels It is really very well for a novel." Such is the common cant. "And what are you reading, [MASK] ?" "Oh!
NorthangerAbbey	56	9559	9554	9610	Udolpho	Have you gone on with [MASK]?" "Yes, I have been reading it ever since I woke; and I am got to the black veil." "Are you, indeed? How delightful! Oh! I would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world!
NorthangerAbbey	50	9658	9611	9661	Laurentina	Are not you wild to know?" "Oh! Yes, quite; what can it be? But do not tell me I would not be told upon any account. I know it must be a skeleton, I am sure it is [MASK] s skeleton.
NorthangerAbbey	51	9727	9710	9761	Udolpho	"Dear creature! How much I am obliged to you; and when you have finished [MASK], we will read the Italian together; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you." "Have you, indeed!
NorthangerAbbey	59	10118	10062	10121	Catherine	Now, if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you, I should fire up in a moment: but that is not at all likely, for _you_ are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men." "Oh, dear!" cried [MASK], colouring.
NorthangerAbbey	41	10198	10163	10204	Catherine	Oh! I must tell you, that just after we parted yesterday, I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly I am sure he is in love with you." [MASK] coloured, and disclaimed again.
NorthangerAbbey	56	10205	10205	10261	Isabella	[MASK] laughed. "It is very true, upon my honour, but I see how it is; you are indifferent to everybody s admiration, except that of one gentleman, who shall be nameless. Nay, I cannot blame you" speaking more seriously "your feelings are easily understood.
NorthangerAbbey	49	10396	10367	10416	Udolpho	"No, indeed, I should not. I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him; but while I have [MASK] to read, I feel as if nobody could make me miserable. Oh! The dreadful black veil!
NorthangerAbbey	46	10557	10536	10582	Catherine	"Do you indeed! You surprise me; I thought it had not been readable. But, my dearest [MASK], have you settled what to wear on your head tonight? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you.
NorthangerAbbey	50	10609	10570	10620	Catherine	I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you. The men take notice of _that_ sometimes, you know." "But it does not signify if they do," said [MASK], very innocently. "Signify! Oh, heavens!
NorthangerAbbey	50	10779	10735	10785	Catherine	Do you like them best dark or fair?" "I hardly know. I never much thought about it. Something between both, I think. Brown not fair, and and not very dark." "Very well, [MASK]. That is exactly he.
NorthangerAbbey	49	11079	11056	11105	Catherine	Pray let me know if they are coming. I am determined I will not look up." In a few moments [MASK], with unaffected pleasure, assured her that she need not be longer uneasy, as the gentlemen had just left the pump-room.
NorthangerAbbey	51	11116	11106	11157	Isabella	"And which way are they gone?" said [MASK], turning hastily round. "One was a very good-looking young man." "They went towards the church-yard." "Well, I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them!
NorthangerAbbey	49	11190	11144	11193	Catherine	"Well, I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them! And now, what say you to going to Edgar s Buildings with me, and looking at my new hat? You said you should like to see it." [MASK] readily agreed.
NorthangerAbbey	43	11597	11588	11631	Isabella	"Oh, these odious gigs!" said [MASK], looking up. "How I detest them." But this detestation, though so just, was of short duration, for she looked again and exclaimed, "Delightful!
NorthangerAbbey	57	11654	11646	11703	Catherine	" was uttered at the same moment by [MASK]; and, on catching the young men s eyes, the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches, and the servant having now scampered up, the gentlemen jumped out, and the equipage was delivered to his care.
NorthangerAbbey	43	12001	11972	12015	Thorpe	"I do not know the distance." Her brother told her that it was twenty-three miles. "_Three_-and-twenty!" cried [MASK], "five-and-twenty if it is an inch."
NorthangerAbbey	56	12016	12016	12072	Morland	[MASK] remonstrated, pleaded the authority of road-books, innkeepers, and milestones; but his friend disregarded them all; he had a surer test of distance. "I know it must be five-and-twenty," said he, "by the time we have been doing it.
NorthangerAbbey	53	12525	12512	12565	Curricle	"I am sure I cannot guess at all." "[MASK]-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case, splashing-board, lamps, silver moulding, all you see complete; the iron-work as good as new, or better.
NorthangerAbbey	53	12597	12566	12619	Catherine	He asked fifty guineas; I closed with him directly, threw down the money, and the carriage was mine." "And I am sure," said [MASK], "I know so little of such things that I cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear."
NorthangerAbbey	43	12663	12651	12694	Catherine	"That was very good-natured of you," said [MASK], quite pleased. "Oh! D it, when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend, I hate to be pitiful."
NorthangerAbbey	41	13013	12989	13030	Catherine	"I am glad of it; I will drive you out in mine every day." "Thank you," said [MASK], in some distress, from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer.
NorthangerAbbey	54	13115	13086	13140	Catherine	No, no; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while I am here." "Shall you indeed!" said [MASK] very seriously. "That will be forty miles a day." "Forty! Aye, fifty, for what I care.
NorthangerAbbey	51	13610	13561	13612	Camilla	"No sure; was it? Aye, I remember, so it was; I was thinking of that other stupid book, written by that woman they make such a fuss about, she who married the French emigrant." "I suppose you mean [MASK]?"
NorthangerAbbey	53	14231	14181	14234	Isabella	"He is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived; a little of a rattle; but that will recommend him to your sex, I believe: and how do you like the rest of the family?" "Very, very much indeed: [MASK] particularly."
NorthangerAbbey	50	16768	16756	16806	Isabella	I have been quite wretched without you." "My dear [MASK], how was it possible for me to get at you? I could not even see where you were." "So I told your brother all the time but he would not believe me.
NorthangerAbbey	46	16915	16912	16958	Heavens	"Oh! [MASK]! You don t say so! Let me look at her this moment. What a delightful girl! I never saw anything half so beautiful! But where is her all-conquering brother? Is he in the room?
NorthangerAbbey	48	17237	17225	17273	Catherine	How can you be so teasing; only conceive, my dear [MASK], what your brother wants me to do. He wants me to dance with him again, though I tell him that it is a most improper thing, and entirely against the rules.
NorthangerAbbey	51	17300	17274	17325	James	It would make us the talk of the place, if we were not to change partners." "Upon my honour," said [MASK], "in these public assemblies, it is as often done as not." "Nonsense, how can you say so?
NorthangerAbbey	53	17344	17326	17379	Catherine	But when you men have a point to carry, you never stick at anything. My sweet [MASK], do support me; persuade your brother how impossible it is. Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing; now would not it?"
NorthangerAbbey	43	17406	17380	17423	Isabella	"No, not at all; but if you think it wrong, you had much better change." "There," cried [MASK], "you hear what your sister says, and yet you will not mind her.
NorthangerAbbey	54	18001	17963	18017	Catherine	Come along with me, and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my two younger sisters and their partners. I have been laughing at them this half hour." Again [MASK] excused herself; and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself.
NorthangerAbbey	50	18102	18097	18147	Catherine	CHAPTER 9 The progress of [MASK] s unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows. It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her, while she remained in the rooms, which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home.
NorthangerAbbey	49	18636	18628	18677	Catherine	"What do you mean?" said [MASK]. "Where are you all going to?" "Going to? Why, you have not forgot our engagement! Did not we agree together to take a drive this morning? What a head you have!
NorthangerAbbey	51	18971	18965	19016	Isabella	My dearest creature," cried [MASK], to whom the duty of friendship immediately called her before she could get into the carriage, "you have been at least three hours getting ready. I was afraid you were ill. What a delightful ball we had last night.
NorthangerAbbey	50	19681	19634	19684	Lord	Does he drink his bottle a day now?" "His bottle a day! No. Why should you think of such a thing? He is a very temperate man, and you could not fancy him in liquor last night?" "[MASK] help you!
NorthangerAbbey	50	19959	19931	19981	Catherine	But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there." "Yes, it does give a notion," said [MASK] warmly, "and that is, that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did.
NorthangerAbbey	54	20065	20065	20119	Thorpe	[MASK] s ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage, and she was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse moved along, and the ease which his paces, as well as the excellence of the springs, gave the motion of the carriage.
NorthangerAbbey	49	20280	20274	20323	Lord	"Break down! Oh! [MASK]! Did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life? There is not a sound piece of iron about it. The wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least and as for the body!
NorthangerAbbey	53	20383	20354	20407	Catherine	we have got a better. I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds." "Good heavens!" cried [MASK], quite frightened. "Then pray let us turn back; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on.
NorthangerAbbey	53	20537	20537	20590	Catherine	[MASK] listened with astonishment; she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing; for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle, nor to know to how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead.
NorthangerAbbey	51	20953	20951	21002	Catherine	Little as [MASK] was in the habit of judging for herself, and unfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be, she could not entirely repress a doubt, while she bore with the effusions of his endless conceit, of his being altogether completely agreeable.
NorthangerAbbey	48	22176	22174	22222	Catherine	My sweetest [MASK], how have you been this long age? But I need not ask you, for you look delightfully. You really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever; you mischievous creature, do you want to attract everybody?
NorthangerAbbey	49	22355	22321	22370	Catherine	Is he in the house now? Look about, for heaven s sake! I assure you, I can hardly exist till I see him." "No," said [MASK], "he is not here; I cannot see him anywhere."
NorthangerAbbey	45	23154	23153	23198	Henry	"[MASK]!" she replied with a smile. "Yes, he does dance very well." "He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other evening, when he saw me sitting down.
NorthangerAbbey	56	23258	23256	23312	Henry	"When [MASK] had the pleasure of seeing you before, he was in Bath but for a couple of days. He came only to engage lodgings for us." "_That_ never occurred to me; and of course, not seeing him anywhere, I thought he must be gone.
NorthangerAbbey	54	23425	23409	23463	Catherine	"I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon," said [MASK]. "Shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow?" "Perhaps we Yes, I think we certainly shall." "I am glad of it, for we shall all be there.
NorthangerAbbey	59	23581	23581	23640	Catherine	[MASK] knew all this very well; her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas before; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin, and nothing but the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening.
NorthangerAbbey	48	24405	24397	24445	Jove	"That is a good one, by [MASK]! I asked you as soon as I came into the room, and I was just going to ask you again, but when I turned round, you were gone! This is a cursed shabby trick!
NorthangerAbbey	53	24581	24532	24585	Catherine	"Oh, no; they will never think of _me_, after such a description as that." "By heavens, if they do not, I will kick them out of the room for blockheads. What chap have you there?" [MASK] satisfied his curiosity.
NorthangerAbbey	44	24764	24742	24786	Catherine	It is so d uncomfortable, living at an inn." This was the last sentence by which he could weary [MASK] s attention, for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies.
NorthangerAbbey	51	26239	26210	26261	Catherine	Here their conversation closed, the demands of the dance becoming now too importunate for a divided attention. Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set, [MASK] perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers-on, immediately behind her partner.
NorthangerAbbey	46	26889	26871	26917	Catherine	At about eleven o clock, however, a few specks of small rain upon the windows caught [MASK] s watchful eye, and "Oh! dear, I do believe it will be wet," broke from her in a most desponding tone.
NorthangerAbbey	49	26940	26931	26980	Catherine	"No walk for me today," sighed [MASK]; "but perhaps it may come to nothing, or it may hold up before twelve." "Perhaps it may, but then, my dear, it will be so dirty." "Oh!
NorthangerAbbey	49	27026	26992	27041	Catherine	"No," replied her friend very placidly, "I know you never mind dirt." After a short pause, "It comes on faster and faster!" said [MASK], as she stood watching at a window. "So it does indeed.
NorthangerAbbey	52	27200	27191	27243	Catherine	The rain continued fast, though not heavy. [MASK] went every five minutes to the clock, threatening on each return that, if it still kept on raining another five minutes, she would give up the matter as hopeless. The clock struck twelve, and it still rained.
NorthangerAbbey	55	28548	28540	28595	Catherine	And in two minutes they were off. [MASK] s feelings, as she got into the carriage, were in a very unsettled state; divided between regret for the loss of one great pleasure, and the hope of soon enjoying another, almost its equal in degree, however unlike in kind.
NorthangerAbbey	42	29247	29229	29271	Catherine	Their drive, even when this subject was over, was not likely to be very agreeable. [MASK] s complaisance was no longer what it had been in their former airing. She listened reluctantly, and her replies were short.
NorthangerAbbey	46	29429	29402	29448	Morland	In the meanwhile, they proceeded on their journey without any mischance, and were within view of the town of Keynsham, when a halloo from [MASK], who was behind them, made his friend pull up, to know what was the matter.
NorthangerAbbey	50	29670	29661	29711	Catherine	"No, he is not," said [MASK] warmly, "for I am sure he could not afford it." "And why cannot he afford it?" "Because he has not money enough." "And whose fault is that?"
NorthangerAbbey	46	30328	30309	30355	John	I never mind going through anything, where a friend is concerned; that is my disposition, and [MASK] is just the same; he has amazing strong feelings. Good heavens! What a delightful hand you have got! Kings, I vow!
NorthangerAbbey	44	31279	31260	31304	Catherine	No smile, no continued observance attended it; his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction. [MASK] was restlessly miserable; she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation.
NorthangerAbbey	55	31895	31869	31924	Eleanor	Perhaps you did not know I had been there." "I was not within at the time; but I heard of it from [MASK], and she has been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of such incivility; but perhaps I can do it as well.
NorthangerAbbey	54	31991	31973	32027	Catherine	She was very much vexed, and meant to make her apology as soon as possible." [MASK] s mind was greatly eased by this information, yet a something of solicitude remained, from which sprang the following question, thoroughly artless in itself, though rather distressing to the gentleman: "
NorthangerAbbey	55	32165	32118	32173	Catherine	"Well, nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face." He replied by asking her to make room for him, and talking of the play. He remained with them some time, and was only too agreeable for [MASK] to be contented when he went away.
NorthangerAbbey	48	33316	33292	33340	Isabella	"No, it would not be easy. I could not do it. There has been no prior engagement." But [MASK] became only more and more urgent, calling on her in the most affectionate manner, addressing her by the most endearing names.
NorthangerAbbey	44	33482	33474	33518	Catherine	"I cannot help being jealous, [MASK], when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who love you so excessively! When once my affections are placed, it is not in the power of anything to change them.
NorthangerAbbey	45	33599	33581	33626	Isabella	Was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others? [MASK] appeared to her ungenerous and selfish, regardless of everything but her own gratification. These painful ideas crossed her mind, though she said nothing.
NorthangerAbbey	50	33983	33940	33990	Thorpe	No, if you do not go, d me if I do. I only go for the sake of driving you." "That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure." But her words were lost on [MASK], who had turned abruptly away.
NorthangerAbbey	47	34195	34182	34229	Thorpe	Thus passed a long ten minutes, till they were again joined by [MASK], who, coming to them with a gayer look, said, "Well, I have settled the matter, and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe conscience.
NorthangerAbbey	49	34618	34608	34657	Catherine	"Then I will go after them," said [MASK]; "wherever they are I will go after them. It does not signify talking. If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it."
NorthangerAbbey	51	35333	35286	35337	William	To such anxious attention was the general s civility carried, that not aware of her extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, he was quite angry with the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of the apartment herself. "What did [MASK] mean by it?
NorthangerAbbey	56	37101	37060	37116	Udolpho	I am proud when I reflect on it, and I think it must establish me in your good opinion." "I am very glad to hear it indeed, and now I shall never be ashamed of liking [MASK] myself. But I really thought before, young men despised novels amazingly."
NorthangerAbbey	45	37286	37269	37314	Udolpho	"Not very good, I am afraid. But now really, do not you think [MASK] the nicest book in the world?" "The nicest by which I suppose you mean the neatest. That must depend upon the binding."
NorthangerAbbey	49	37455	37449	37498	Henry	"Very true," said [MASK], "and this is a very nice day, and we are taking a very nice walk, and you are two very nice young ladies. Oh! It is a very nice word indeed! It does for everything.
NorthangerAbbey	58	39259	39218	39276	Henry	But I hope your friend s accounts have been exaggerated; and if such a design is known beforehand, proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect." "Government," said [MASK], endeavouring not to smile, "neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters.
NorthangerAbbey	47	40421	40421	40468	Catherine	[MASK], a little doubtful of this, could not help answering, "I wish you could have gone too. It is a pity you could not all go." "Thank you; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me.
NorthangerAbbey	43	40923	40901	40944	John	"She will never forgive me, I am sure; but, you know, how could I help it? [MASK] would have me go, for he vowed he would not drive her, because she had such thick ankles.
NorthangerAbbey	50	41059	41045	41095	Catherine	Oh! That arch eye of yours! It sees through everything." [MASK] replied only by a look of wondering ignorance. "Nay, my beloved, sweetest friend," continued the other, "compose yourself. I am amazingly agitated, as you perceive.
NorthangerAbbey	49	41126	41122	41171	Catherine	Oh! My dear [MASK], you alone, who know my heart, can judge of my present happiness. Your brother is the most charming of men. I only wish I were more worthy of him. But what will your excellent father and mother say?
NorthangerAbbey	50	41187	41174	41224	Catherine	Heavens! When I think of them I am so agitated!" [MASK] s understanding began to awake: an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind; and, with the natural blush of so new an emotion, she cried out, "Good heaven!
NorthangerAbbey	54	41274	41246	41300	Isabella	This bold surmise, however, she soon learnt comprehended but half the fact. The anxious affection, which she was accused of having continually watched in [MASK] s every look and action, had, in the course of their yesterday s party, received the delightful confession of an equal love.
NorthangerAbbey	59	41313	41311	41370	Catherine	Never had [MASK] listened to anything so full of interest, wonder, and joy. Her brother and her friend engaged! New to such circumstances, the importance of it appeared unspeakably great, and she contemplated it as one of those grand events, of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return.
NorthangerAbbey	41	41586	41559	41600	John	I remember I wore my yellow gown, with my hair done up in braids; and when I came into the drawing-room, and [MASK] introduced him, I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before."
NorthangerAbbey	53	41691	41691	41744	Catherine	[MASK], the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother s account! I would not have you suffer half what I have done! I am grown wretchedly thin, I know; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety; you have seen enough of it.
NorthangerAbbey	55	42005	41989	42044	Catherine	The difference of fortune can be nothing to signify." "Oh! My sweet [MASK], in _your_ generous heart I know it would signify nothing; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many. As for myself, I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed.
NorthangerAbbey	41	42082	42069	42110	Catherine	This charming sentiment, recommended as much by sense as novelty, gave [MASK] a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea.
NorthangerAbbey	53	42145	42111	42164	Isabella	"I am sure they will consent," was her frequent declaration; "I am sure they will be delighted with you." "For my own part," said [MASK], "my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me.
NorthangerAbbey	48	42332	42300	42348	Isabella	Tomorrow? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter. I know it will be the death of me." A reverie succeeded this conviction and when [MASK] spoke again, it was to resolve on the quality of her wedding-gown.
NorthangerAbbey	48	42486	42484	42532	Morland	Indeed, [MASK], I must drive you away. Consider how far you have to ride. I cannot bear to see you linger so. For heaven s sake, waste no more time. There, go, go I insist on it."
NorthangerAbbey	52	43429	43384	43436	Belle	"Do you? That s honest, by heavens! I am glad you are no enemy to matrimony, however. Did you ever hear the old song Going to One Wedding Brings on Another? I say, you will come to [MASK] s wedding, I hope."
NorthangerAbbey	47	43580	43541	43588	Catherine	Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight, and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me." "Then why do you stay away so long?" replied [MASK] finding that he waited for an answer.
NorthangerAbbey	49	43922	43894	43943	Jove	And as to _most matters_, to say the truth, there are not many that I know my own mind about." "By [MASK], no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me.
NorthangerAbbey	50	44672	44649	44699	Isabella	The former she hoped at last might have been accidental, and the latter she could only attribute to her own stupidity. [MASK], on hearing the particulars of the visit, gave a different explanation: "It was all pride, pride, insufferable haughtiness and pride!
NorthangerAbbey	52	44774	44734	44786	Isabella	Not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding! To behave to her guest with such superciliousness! Hardly even to speak to her!" "But it was not so bad as that, [MASK]; there was no superciliousness; she was very civil."
NorthangerAbbey	50	44880	44867	44917	Catherine	Let me entreat you never to think of him again, my dear [MASK]; indeed he is unworthy of you." "Unworthy! I do not suppose he ever thinks of me." "That is exactly what I say; he never thinks of you.
NorthangerAbbey	49	44935	44893	44942	John	I do not suppose he ever thinks of me." "That is exactly what I say; he never thinks of you. Such fickleness! Oh! How different to your brother and to mine! I really believe [MASK] has the most constant heart."
NorthangerAbbey	51	46257	46254	46305	Isabella	"And did [MASK] never change her mind before?" "Oh! But, because And your brother! After what you told him from me, how could he think of going to ask her?" "I cannot take surprise to myself on that head.
NorthangerAbbey	54	46385	46350	46404	Isabella	The fairness of your friend was an open attraction; her firmness, you know, could only be understood by yourself." "You are laughing; but, I assure you, [MASK] is very firm in general." "It is as much as should be said of anyone.
NorthangerAbbey	53	46485	46453	46506	Isabella	The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse till all the dancing was over; but then, as they walked about the room arm in arm, [MASK] thus explained herself: "I do not wonder at your surprise; and I am really fatigued to death.
NorthangerAbbey	46	47217	47191	47237	Morland	"It is not on my own account I wish for more; but I cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear [MASK], making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life.
NorthangerAbbey	57	47433	47408	47465	Catherine	But everybody has their failing, you know, and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money." [MASK] was hurt by these insinuations. "I am very sure," said she, "that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford."
NorthangerAbbey	46	47662	47647	47693	Isabella	She endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of [MASK] s regret; and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever, endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise.
NorthangerAbbey	54	48176	48157	48211	Eleanor	After addressing her with his usual politeness, he turned to his daughter and said, "Well, [MASK], may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend?" "I was just beginning to make the request, sir, as you came in."
NorthangerAbbey	49	48499	48491	48540	Catherine	These were thrilling words, and wound up [MASK] s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy. Her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness. To receive so flattering an invitation! To have her company so warmly solicited!
NorthangerAbbey	41	48901	48870	48911	Isabella	Her feelings, her preferences, had each known the happiness of a return. Wherever she felt attachment, she had been able to create it. The affection of [MASK] was to be secured to her in a sister.
NorthangerAbbey	47	49749	49744	49791	Isabella	"But I thought, [MASK], you had something in particular to tell me?" "Oh! Yes, and so I have. But here is a proof of what I was saying. My poor head, I had quite forgot it.
NorthangerAbbey	50	49806	49764	49814	John	Yes, and so I have. But here is a proof of what I was saying. My poor head, I had quite forgot it. Well, the thing is this: I have just had a letter from [MASK]; you can guess the contents."
NorthangerAbbey	54	49867	49815	49869	Isabella	"No, indeed, I cannot." "My sweet love, do not be so abominably affected. What can he write about, but yourself? You know he is over head and ears in love with you." "With _me_, dear [MASK]!"
NorthangerAbbey	52	49875	49870	49922	Catherine	"Nay, my sweetest [MASK], this is being quite absurd! Modesty, and all that, is very well in its way, but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming. I have no idea of being so overstrained! It is fishing for compliments.
NorthangerAbbey	45	49944	49908	49953	Bath	I have no idea of being so overstrained! It is fishing for compliments. His attentions were such as a child must have noticed. And it was but half an hour before he left [MASK] that you gave him the most positive encouragement.
NorthangerAbbey	42	50458	50457	50499	Isabella	" [MASK] was silent. "My dear friend, you must not be angry with me. I cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me. And, you know, we shall still be sisters."
NorthangerAbbey	52	50591	50554	50606	John	"I certainly cannot return his affection, and as certainly never meant to encourage it." "Since that is the case, I am sure I shall not tease you any further. [MASK] desired me to speak to you on the subject, and therefore I have.
NorthangerAbbey	54	50694	50691	50745	John	I only wonder [MASK] could think of it; he could not have received my last." "You _do_ acquit me, then, of anything wrong? You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother, never suspected him of liking me till this moment?"
NorthangerAbbey	53	50755	50723	50776	Isabella	You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother, never suspected him of liking me till this moment?" "Oh! As to that," answered [MASK] laughingly, "I do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been.
NorthangerAbbey	48	50894	50883	50931	Catherine	You are describing what never happened." "My dearest [MASK]," continued the other without at all listening to her, "I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about.
NorthangerAbbey	51	51038	51019	51070	Catherine	You know I carry my notions of friendship pretty high. But, above all things, my dear [MASK], do not be in a hurry. Take my word for it, that if you are in too great a hurry, you will certainly live to repent it.
NorthangerAbbey	50	51071	51047	51097	Tilney	Take my word for it, that if you are in too great a hurry, you will certainly live to repent it. [MASK] says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections, and I believe he is very right.
NorthangerAbbey	44	51164	51145	51189	Catherine	He approached immediately, and took the seat to which her movements invited him. His first address made [MASK] start. Though spoken low, she could distinguish, "What! Always to be watched, in person or by proxy!"
NorthangerAbbey	55	51467	51423	51478	Catherine	She was so amazingly tired, and it was so odious to parade about the pump-room; and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters; she was expecting her sisters every moment; so that her dearest [MASK] must excuse her, and must sit quietly down again.
NorthangerAbbey	46	51636	51626	51672	Catherine	How strange that she should not perceive his admiration! [MASK] longed to give her a hint of it, to put her on her guard, and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother.
NorthangerAbbey	48	51927	51913	51961	Catherine	A something of languid indifference, or of that boasted absence of mind which [MASK] had never heard of before, would occasionally come across her; but had nothing worse appeared, _that_ might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest.
NorthangerAbbey	54	52378	52369	52423	Henry	"My brother does know it," was [MASK] s answer. "Does he? Then why does he stay here?" He made no reply, and was beginning to talk of something else; but she eagerly continued, "Why do not you persuade him to go away?
NorthangerAbbey	50	52485	52485	52535	Henry	[MASK] smiled and said, "I am sure my brother would not wish to do that." "Then you will persuade him to go away?" "Persuasion is not at command; but pardon me, if I cannot even endeavour to persuade him.
NorthangerAbbey	43	52576	52547	52590	Catherine	He knows what he is about, and must be his own master." "No, he does not know what he is about," cried [MASK]; "he does not know the pain he is giving my brother.
NorthangerAbbey	50	53077	53031	53081	Catherine	My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man; he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend, and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her." "Well," said [MASK], after some moments
NorthangerAbbey	48	54118	54091	54139	Isabella	He listened to his father in silence, and attempted not any defence, which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind, on [MASK] s account, might, by keeping him long sleepless, have been the real cause of his rising late.
NorthangerAbbey	46	54630	54603	54649	Catherine	but by himself; the observation of which, with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded, and his angry impatience at the waiters, made [MASK] grow every moment more in awe of him, and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four.
NorthangerAbbey	53	54915	54901	54954	Henry	But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses; [MASK] drove so well so quietly without making any disturbance, without parading to her, or swearing at them: so different from the only gentleman-coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with!
NorthangerAbbey	42	55092	55051	55093	Catherine	His sister, he said, was uncomfortably circumstanced she had no female companion and, in the frequent absence of her father, was sometimes without any companion at all. "But how can that be?" said [MASK].
NorthangerAbbey	50	55161	55154	55204	Eleanor	"I am always sorry to leave [MASK]." "Yes; but besides your affection for her, you must be so fond of the abbey! After being used to such a home as the abbey, an ordinary parsonage-house must be very disagreeable."
NorthangerAbbey	51	55443	55426	55477	Dorothy	While they snugly repair to their own end of the house, she is formally conducted by [MASK], the ancient housekeeper, up a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages, into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before.
NorthangerAbbey	52	55811	55803	55855	Dorothy	I am sure your housekeeper is not really [MASK]. Well, what then?" "Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night. After surmounting your _unconquerable_ horror of the bed, you will retire to rest, and get a few hours unquiet slumber.
NorthangerAbbey	50	56076	56053	56103	Dorothy	"No, indeed; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing." "What! Not when [MASK] has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony, scarcely two miles off?
NorthangerAbbey	59	57703	57703	57762	Catherine	[MASK] bent over it intently, but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty. She could not, in whatever direction she took it, believe the last letter to be a _T;_ and yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment.
NorthangerAbbey	55	58268	58238	58293	Catherine	The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open. In that corner, however, it is at least out of the way." [MASK] had no leisure for speech, being at once blushing, tying her gown, and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch.
NorthangerAbbey	52	58880	58880	58932	Catherine	[MASK], as she crossed the hall, listened to the tempest with sensations of awe; and, when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door, felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey.
NorthangerAbbey	46	59499	59499	59545	Henry	[MASK] s words, his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first, immediately rushed across her; and though there could be nothing really in it, there was something whimsical, it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence!
NorthangerAbbey	55	59635	59596	59651	Henry	The key was in the door, and she had a strange fancy to look into it; not, however, with the smallest expectation of finding anything, but it was so very odd, after what [MASK] had said. In short, she could not sleep till she had examined it.
NorthangerAbbey	45	59919	59919	59964	Catherine	[MASK] s heart beat quick, but her courage did not fail her. With a cheek flushed by hope, and an eye straining with curiosity, her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth. It was entirely empty.
NorthangerAbbey	49	60225	60191	60240	Henry	She seized, with an unsteady hand, the precious manuscript, for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what [MASK] had foretold, resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest.
NorthangerAbbey	51	60322	60303	60354	Catherine	It was snuffed and extinguished in one. A lamp could not have expired with more awful effect. [MASK], for a few moments, was motionless with horror. It was done completely; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath.
NorthangerAbbey	48	60381	60363	60411	Catherine	A violent gust of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the moment. [MASK] trembled from head to foot. In the pause which succeeded, a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear.
NorthangerAbbey	55	60741	60708	60763	Catherine	Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans. Hour after hour passed away, and the wearied [MASK] had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep.
NorthangerAbbey	49	61870	61828	61877	Mamma	"But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors. The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me, and in fine weather I am out more than half my time. [MASK] says I am never within."
NorthangerAbbey	44	62261	62256	62300	Eleanor	"What say you, [MASK]? Speak your opinion, for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men. I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations.
NorthangerAbbey	58	62381	62380	62438	Henry	Did [MASK] s income depend solely on this living, he would not be ill-provided for. Perhaps it may seem odd, that with only two younger children, I should think any profession necessary for him; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business.
NorthangerAbbey	48	62495	62477	62525	Frederick	The money is nothing, it is not an object, but employment is the thing. Even [MASK], my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county, has his profession."
NorthangerAbbey	45	63006	62981	63026	Henry	It was certainly very provoking. She was all impatience to see the house, and had scarcely any curiosity about the grounds. If [MASK] had been with them indeed! But now she should not know what was picturesque when she saw it.
NorthangerAbbey	53	63780	63756	63809	Catherine	But perhaps it may be damp." It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs; and [MASK], struck by its gloomy aspect, and eager to enter it, could not, even by the general s disapprobation, be kept from stepping forward.
NorthangerAbbey	52	63872	63834	63886	Catherine	He excused himself, however, from attending them: "The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him, and he would meet them by another course." He turned away; and [MASK] was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation.
NorthangerAbbey	49	64004	63991	64040	Eleanor	"I used to walk here so often with her!" added [MASK]; "though I never loved it then, as I have loved it since. At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice. But her memory endears it now."
NorthangerAbbey	46	64049	64021	64067	Catherine	At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice. But her memory endears it now." "And ought it not," reflected [MASK], "to endear it to her husband? Yet the general would not enter it."
NorthangerAbbey	49	64512	64503	64552	Catherine	He must have been dreadfully cruel to her! [MASK] attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which, in spite of all his attentions, he had previously excited; and what had been terror and dislike before, was now absolute aversion.
NorthangerAbbey	50	64763	64748	64798	Catherine	This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck [MASK] as very remarkable. CHAPTER 23 An hour passed away before the general came in, spent, on the part of his young guest, in no very favourable consideration of his character.
NorthangerAbbey	51	65124	65124	65175	Catherine	[MASK] heard, admired, and wondered with more genuine feeling than before gathered all that she could from this storehouse of knowledge, by running over the titles of half a shelf, and was ready to proceed. But suites of apartments did not spring up with her wishes.
NorthangerAbbey	44	66583	66583	66627	Catherine	[MASK] understood her: the general must be watched from home, before that room could be entered. "It remains as it was, I suppose?" said she, in a tone of feeling. "Yes, entirely."
NorthangerAbbey	47	66656	66652	66699	Catherine	And nine years, [MASK] knew, was a trifle of time, compared with what generally elapsed after the death of an injured wife, before her room was put to rights. "You were with her, I suppose, to the last?"
NorthangerAbbey	56	66921	66889	66945	Catherine	"My father," she whispered, "often walks about the room in this way; it is nothing unusual." "So much the worse!" thought [MASK]; such ill-timed exercise was of a piece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks, and boded nothing good.
NorthangerAbbey	49	67035	67023	67072	Catherine	"I have many pamphlets to finish," said he to [MASK], "before I can close my eyes, and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep. Can either of us be more meetly employed? _
NorthangerAbbey	52	67110	67097	67149	Catherine	But neither the business alleged, nor the magnificent compliment, could win [MASK] from thinking that some very different object must occasion so serious a delay of proper repose. To be kept up for hours, after the family were in bed, by stupid pamphlets was not very likely.
NorthangerAbbey	52	67510	67493	67545	Catherine	Down that staircase she had perhaps been conveyed in a state of well-prepared insensibility! [MASK] sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises, and sometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far; but they were supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible.
NorthangerAbbey	50	68378	68353	68403	Eleanor	Her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any endeavour at discourse; she could only look at her companion. [MASK] s countenance was dejected, yet sedate; and its composure spoke her inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing.
NorthangerAbbey	57	68422	68404	68461	Catherine	Again she passed through the folding doors, again her hand was upon the important lock, and [MASK], hardly able to breathe, was turning to close the former with fearful caution, when the figure, the dreaded figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery, stood before her!
NorthangerAbbey	48	68829	68820	68868	Eleanor	It would be much better in every respect that [MASK] should know nothing of the matter. To involve her in the danger of a second detection, to court her into an apartment which must wring her heart, could not be the office of a friend.
NorthangerAbbey	57	69069	69064	69121	Catherine	It was done; and [MASK] found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike. It was no time for thought; she hurried on, slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors, and without stopping to look or breathe, rushed forward to the one in question.
NorthangerAbbey	53	69233	69233	69286	Catherine	[MASK] had expected to have her feelings worked, and worked they were. Astonishment and doubt first seized them; and a shortly succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame. She could not be mistaken as to the room; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!
NorthangerAbbey	54	69691	69649	69703	Catherine	"How came I up that staircase!" he replied, greatly surprised. "Because it is my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber; and why should I not come up it?" [MASK] recollected herself, blushed deeply, and could say no more.
NorthangerAbbey	50	69797	69760	69810	Catherine	This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast-parlour to your apartment, as that staircase can be from the stables to mine." "I have been," said [MASK], looking down, "to see your mother s room."
NorthangerAbbey	44	69941	69917	69961	Eleanor	"No, I was not. You have had a very fine day for your ride." "Very; and does [MASK] leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself?" "Oh!
NorthangerAbbey	49	70003	69959	70008	Henry	"Oh! No; she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only" dropping her voice "your father was with us." "And that prevented you," said [MASK], earnestly regarding her.
NorthangerAbbey	48	70150	70140	70188	Isabella	"No, and I am very much surprised. [MASK] promised so faithfully to write directly." "Promised so faithfully! A faithful promise! That puzzles me. I have heard of a faithful performance. But a faithful promise the fidelity of promising!
NorthangerAbbey	52	70252	70219	70271	Eleanor	Large and cheerful-looking, and the dressing-closets so well disposed! It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house, and I rather wonder that [MASK] should not take it for her own. She sent you to look at it, I suppose?
NorthangerAbbey	56	70339	70291	70347	Eleanor	After a short silence, during which he had closely observed her, he added, "As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity, this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character, as described by [MASK], which does honour to her memory.
NorthangerAbbey	49	70404	70375	70424	Eleanor	The domestic, unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent, venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours. [MASK], I suppose, has talked of her a great deal?" "Yes, a great deal.
NorthangerAbbey	57	70669	70662	70719	Frederick	During the progress of her disorder, [MASK] and I (_we_ were both at home) saw her repeatedly; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her, or which her situation in life could command.
NorthangerAbbey	42	70875	70843	70885	Catherine	His value of her was sincere; and, if not permanently, he was truly afflicted by her death." "I am very glad of it," said [MASK]; "it would have been very shocking!"
NorthangerAbbey	42	71083	71083	71125	Henry	[MASK] s address, short as it had been, had more thoroughly opened her eyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their several disappointments had done. Most grievously was she humbled. Most bitterly did she cry.
NorthangerAbbey	47	71138	71114	71161	Henry	Most grievously was she humbled. Most bitterly did she cry. It was not only with herself that she was sunk but with [MASK]. Her folly, which now seemed even criminal, was all exposed to him, and he must despise her forever.
NorthangerAbbey	46	71267	71228	71274	Eleanor	But now in short, she made herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour, went down when the clock struck five, with a broken heart, and could scarcely give an intelligible answer to [MASK] s inquiry if she was well.
NorthangerAbbey	58	71377	71323	71381	Henry	The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness; and her spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity. She did not learn either to forget or defend the past; but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther, and that it might not cost her [MASK] s entire regard.
NorthangerAbbey	47	72421	72390	72437	Catherine	After my father s consent had been so kindly given but no more of this. She has made me miserable forever! Let me soon hear from you, dear [MASK]; you are my only friend; _your_ love I do build upon.
NorthangerAbbey	44	72702	72678	72722	Catherine	He was prevented, however, from even looking his surprise by his father s entrance. They went to breakfast directly; but [MASK] could hardly eat anything. Tears filled her eyes, and even ran down her cheeks as she sat.
NorthangerAbbey	41	72874	72847	72888	Eleanor	She drew back, trying to beg their pardon, but was, with gentle violence, forced to return; and the others withdrew, after [MASK] had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort to her.
NorthangerAbbey	54	72901	72889	72943	Catherine	After half an hour s free indulgence of grief and reflection, [MASK] felt equal to encountering her friends; but whether she should make her distress known to them was another consideration. Perhaps, if particularly questioned, she might just give an idea just distantly hint at it but not more.
NorthangerAbbey	54	72953	72923	72977	Isabella	Perhaps, if particularly questioned, she might just give an idea just distantly hint at it but not more. To expose a friend, such a friend as [MASK] had been to her and then their own brother so closely concerned in it! She believed she must waive the subject altogether.
NorthangerAbbey	49	73121	73114	73163	Henry	"I am sorry," said [MASK], closing the book he had just opened; "if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome, I should have given it with very different feelings." "It contained something worse than anybody could suppose!
NorthangerAbbey	49	73217	73207	73256	Catherine	"I have one favour to beg," said [MASK], shortly afterwards, in an agitated manner, "that, if your brother should be coming here, you will give me notice of it, that I may go away." "Our brother!
NorthangerAbbey	54	73386	73380	73434	Isabella	I have not heard from her [MASK] has deserted my brother, and is to marry yours! Could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness, and everything that is bad in the world?" "I hope, so far as concerns my brother, you are misinformed.
NorthangerAbbey	48	73563	73522	73570	Catherine	Stay There is one part " recollecting with a blush the last line. "Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother?" "No, read it yourself," cried [MASK], whose second thoughts were clearer.
NorthangerAbbey	49	73771	73767	73816	Isabella	I do not believe [MASK] has any fortune at all: but that will not signify in your family. Your father is so very liberal! He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children.
NorthangerAbbey	45	73832	73828	73873	Eleanor	But," said [MASK], after a short pause, "would it be to promote his happiness, to enable him to marry such a girl? She must be an unprincipled one, or she could not have used your brother so.
NorthangerAbbey	48	73910	73910	73958	Frederick	[MASK] too, who always wore his heart so proudly! Who found no woman good enough to be loved!" "That is the most unpromising circumstance, the strongest presumption against him. When I think of his past declarations, I give him up.
NorthangerAbbey	48	74013	74004	74052	Eleanor	Prepare for your sister-in-law, [MASK], and such a sister-in-law as you must delight in! Open, candid, artless, guileless, with affections strong but simple, forming no pretensions, and knowing no disguise."
NorthangerAbbey	41	74082	74076	74117	Catherine	"But perhaps," observed [MASK], "though she has behaved so ill by our family, she may behave better by yours. Now she has really got the man she likes, she may be constant."
NorthangerAbbey	56	74320	74283	74339	Isabella	"Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present; but we must not, in our concern for his sufferings, undervalue yours. You feel, I suppose, that in losing [MASK], you lose half yourself: you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy.
NorthangerAbbey	54	74537	74523	74577	Catherine	Such feelings ought to be investigated, that they may know themselves." [MASK], by some chance or other, found her spirits so very much relieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being led on, though so unaccountably, to mention the circumstance which had produced it.
NorthangerAbbey	49	75007	74967	75016	Frederick	She proposed it to him accordingly; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected. "No," said he, "my father s hands need not be strengthened, and [MASK] s confession of folly need not be forestalled.
NorthangerAbbey	54	75440	75405	75459	Brockham	Let me see; Monday will be a busy day with you, we will not come on Monday; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me. I expect my surveyor from [MASK] with his report in the morning; and afterwards I cannot in decency fail attending the club.
NorthangerAbbey	44	75574	75554	75598	Henry	Tuesday, therefore, we may say is out of the question. But on Wednesday, I think, [MASK], you may expect us; and we shall be with you early, that we may have time to look about us.
NorthangerAbbey	55	75929	75877	75932	Henry	"Aye, and sadly too for I had much rather stay." "But how can you think of such a thing, after what the general said? When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble, because _anything_ would do." [MASK] only smiled.
NorthangerAbbey	52	76606	76606	76658	Catherine	[MASK] s mind was too full, as she entered the house, for her either to observe or to say a great deal; and, till called on by the general for her opinion of it, she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting.
NorthangerAbbey	48	77181	77176	77224	Catherine	Such a compliment recalled all [MASK] s consciousness, and silenced her directly; and, though pointedly applied to by the general for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings, nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her.
NorthangerAbbey	48	77591	77589	77637	Catherine	My dearest [MASK], I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight, and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner. I really am quite ashamed of my idleness; but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing.
NorthangerAbbey	54	78259	78208	78262	Tilney	I have not been to the rooms this age, nor to the play, except going in last night with the Hodges, for a frolic, at half price: they teased me into it; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up because [MASK] was gone.
NorthangerAbbey	50	78438	78403	78453	Catherine	I wear nothing but purple now: I know I look hideous in it, but no matter it is your dear brother s favourite colour. Lose no time, my dearest, sweetest [MASK], in writing to him and to me, Who ever am, etc.
NorthangerAbbey	47	78485	78467	78514	Isabella	Its inconsistencies, contradictions, and falsehood struck her from the very first. She was ashamed of [MASK], and ashamed of having ever loved her. Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty, and her demands impudent. "
NorthangerAbbey	55	78586	78577	78632	Isabella	When she had finished it "So much for [MASK]," she cried, "and for all our intimacy! She must think me an idiot, or she could not have written so; but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her.
NorthangerAbbey	46	78665	78633	78679	James	I see what she has been about. She is a vain coquette, and her tricks have not answered. I do not believe she had ever any regard either for [MASK] or for me, and I wish I had never known her."
NorthangerAbbey	43	78769	78738	78781	Frederick	Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother, and then fly off himself?" "I have very little to say for [MASK] s motives, such as I believe them to have been.
NorthangerAbbey	53	78875	78861	78914	Henry	"And only made believe to do so for mischief s sake?" [MASK] bowed his assent. "Well, then, I must say that I do not like him at all. Though it has turned out so well for us, I do not like him at all.
NorthangerAbbey	55	78931	78897	78952	Isabella	Though it has turned out so well for us, I do not like him at all. As it happens, there is no great harm done, because I do not think [MASK] has any heart to lose. But, suppose he had made her very much in love with him?"
NorthangerAbbey	52	78959	78953	79005	Isabella	"But we must first suppose [MASK] to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature; and, in that case, she would have met with very different treatment." "It is very right that you should stand by your brother."
NorthangerAbbey	41	79768	79762	79803	Henry	She did almost always believe that [MASK] loved her, and quite always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them; and believing so far, her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive irritations.
NorthangerAbbey	56	80015	79987	80043	Eleanor	After the first perturbation of surprise had passed away, in a "Good heaven! What can be the matter?" it was quickly decided by [MASK] to be her eldest brother, whose arrival was often as sudden, if not quite so unseasonable, and accordingly she hurried down to welcome him.
NorthangerAbbey	49	80607	80578	80627	Catherine	Her voice faltered, and her eyes were turned to the ground as she mentioned his name. His unlooked-for return was enough in itself to make [MASK] s heart sink, and for a few moments she hardly supposed there were anything worse to be told.
NorthangerAbbey	51	80633	80628	80679	Eleanor	She said nothing; and [MASK], endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness, but with eyes still cast down, soon went on. "You are too good, I am sure, to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform.
NorthangerAbbey	46	81009	81004	81050	Eleanor	Do not be distressed, [MASK], I can go on Monday very well. My father and mother s having no notice of it is of very little consequence. The general will send a servant with me, I dare say, half the way
NorthangerAbbey	51	81154	81110	81161	Catherine	tomorrow morning is fixed for your leaving us, and not even the hour is left to your choice; the very carriage is ordered, and will be here at seven o clock, and no servant will be offered you." [MASK] sat down, breathless and speechless.
NorthangerAbbey	48	81336	81327	81375	Catherine	"Have I offended the general?" said [MASK] in a faltering voice. "Alas! For my feelings as a daughter, all that I know, all that I answer for, is that you can have given him no just cause of offence.
NorthangerAbbey	48	81507	81470	81518	Eleanor	"I am sure," said she, "I am very sorry if I have offended him. It was the last thing I would willingly have done. But do not be unhappy, [MASK]. An engagement, you know, must be kept.
NorthangerAbbey	52	81691	81676	81728	Eleanor	I can be ready by seven. Let me be called in time." [MASK] saw that she wished to be alone; and believing it better for each that they should avoid any further conversation, now left her with, "I shall see you in the morning."
NorthangerAbbey	48	81799	81762	81810	Henry	Turned from the house, and in such a way! Without any reason that could justify, any apology that could atone for the abruptness, the rudeness, nay, the insolence of it. [MASK] at a distance not able even to bid him farewell.
NorthangerAbbey	47	82243	82243	82290	Catherine	[MASK] had not loitered; she was almost dressed, and her packing almost finished. The possibility of some conciliatory message from the general occurred to her as his daughter appeared. What so natural, as that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it?
NorthangerAbbey	51	82338	82291	82342	Eleanor	And she only wanted to know how far, after what had passed, an apology might properly be received by her. But the knowledge would have been useless here; it was not called for; neither clemency nor dignity was put to the trial [MASK] brought no message.
NorthangerAbbey	45	82402	82393	82438	Catherine	When everything was done they left the room, [MASK] lingering only half a minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well-known, cherished object, and went down to the breakfast-parlour, where breakfast was prepared.
NorthangerAbbey	48	82685	82676	82724	Catherine	"You _must_ write to me, [MASK]," she cried; "you _must_ let me hear from you as soon as possible. Till I know you to be safe at home, I shall not have an hour s comfort.
NorthangerAbbey	49	82844	82832	82881	Eleanor	There can be no doubt of my getting home safe." [MASK] only replied, "I cannot wonder at your feelings. I will not importune you. I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you."
NorthangerAbbey	50	82958	82944	82994	Catherine	It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home, [MASK] might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey, and, upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation, it proved to be exactly the case.
NorthangerAbbey	59	83217	83165	83224	Catherine	But with this approach to his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings; and, hiding her face as well as she could with her handkerchief, she darted across the hall, jumped into the chaise, and in a moment was driven from the door. CHAPTER 29 [MASK] was too wretched to be fearful.
NorthangerAbbey	55	83586	83581	83636	Henry	Designedly, at least, [MASK] could not have betrayed her. If, indeed, by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for, of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations, she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation.
NorthangerAbbey	41	85151	85151	85192	Catherine	[MASK] sighed. "Well," continued her philosophic mother, "I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time; but now it is all over, perhaps there is no great harm done.
NorthangerAbbey	51	85271	85271	85322	Catherine	[MASK] hoped so too, and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment, but her spirits were quite worn down; and, to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish, she readily agreed to her mother s next counsel of going early to bed.
NorthangerAbbey	45	86661	86634	86679	Catherine	You know, you and I were quite forlorn at first." "Yes, but _that_ did not last long," said [MASK], her eyes brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existence there.
NorthangerAbbey	41	86999	86968	87009	Catherine	There was a great deal of good sense in all this; but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power; and [MASK] s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced.
NorthangerAbbey	43	87088	87086	87129	Catherine	CHAPTER 30 [MASK] s disposition was not naturally sedentary, nor had her habits been ever very industrious; but whatever might hitherto have been her defects of that sort, her mother could not but perceive them now to be greatly increased.
NorthangerAbbey	58	87599	87599	87657	Catherine	[MASK] said no more, and, with an endeavour to do right, applied to her work; but, after a few minutes, sunk again, without knowing it herself, into languor and listlessness, moving herself in her chair, from the irritation of weariness, much oftener than she moved her needle.
NorthangerAbbey	45	90470	90437	90482	Goodwill	His pleasing manners and good sense were self-evident recommendations; and having never heard evil of him, it was not their way to suppose any evil could be told. [MASK] supplying the place of experience, his character needed no attestation.
