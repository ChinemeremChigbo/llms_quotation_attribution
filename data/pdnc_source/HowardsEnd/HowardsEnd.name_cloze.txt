HowardsEnd	49	76	59	108	Paul	We can scarcely pack in as it is, and the dear knows what will happen when [MASK] (younger son) arrives to-morrow. From hall you go right or left into dining-room or drawing-room. Hall itself is practically a room.
HowardsEnd	49	367	331	380	Tibby	We females are that unjust." "I shall be back Saturday; will let you know train later. They are as angry as I am that you did not come too; really [MASK] is too tiresome, he starts a new mortal disease every month.
HowardsEnd	43	673	672	715	Evie	Then [MASK] comes out, and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a green-gage-tree--they put everything to use--and then she says a-tissue, and in she goes.
HowardsEnd	46	777	735	781	Meg	I inflict all this on you because once you said that life is sometimes life and sometimes only a drama, and one must learn to distinguish tother from which, and up to now I have always put that down as [MASK] s clever nonsense.
HowardsEnd	48	1162	1123	1171	Meg	He says the most horrid things about woman s suffrage so nicely, and when I said I believed in equality he just folded his arms and gave me such a setting down as I ve never had. [MASK], shall we ever learn to talk less?
HowardsEnd	50	1359	1345	1395	Evie	The whole clan s here now--it s like a rabbit warren. [MASK] is a dear. They want me to stop over Sunday--I suppose it won t matter if I do. Marvellous weather and the views marvellous--views westward to the high ground.
HowardsEnd	50	1411	1372	1422	HELEN	I suppose it won t matter if I do. Marvellous weather and the views marvellous--views westward to the high ground. Thank you for your letter. Burn this." "Your affectionate" "[MASK]." "Howards End," "Sunday."
HowardsEnd	44	1732	1722	1766	Margaret	"I still feel quite uneasy about this business, [MASK]." "The train crossed by a bridge of boats, and at first sight it looked quite fine. But oh, in five minutes we had seen the whole thing.
HowardsEnd	50	2364	2351	2401	Helen	Are they our sort? Are they likely people? Could they appreciate [MASK], who is to my mind a very special sort of person? Do they care about Literature and Art? That is most important when you come to think of it. Literature and Art.
HowardsEnd	52	2431	2398	2450	Helen	Literature and Art. Most important. How old would the son be? She says younger son. Would he be in a position to marry? Is he likely to make [MASK] happy? Did you gather--" "I gathered nothing." They began to talk at once.
HowardsEnd	51	2489	2444	2495	Helen	They began to talk at once. "Then in that case--" "In that case I can make no plans, don t you see." "On the contrary--" "I hate plans. I hate lines of action. [MASK] isn t a baby."
HowardsEnd	54	2591	2560	2614	Helen	" The affections are more reticent than the passions, and their expression more subtle. If she herself should ever fall in love with a man, she, like [MASK], would proclaim it from the housetops, but as she loved only a sister she used the voiceless language of sympathy.
HowardsEnd	50	2806	2789	2839	Helen	You would say the wrong thing; to a certainty you would. In your anxiety for [MASK] s happiness you would offend the whole of these Wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions--not that one minds offending them." "I shall ask no questions.
HowardsEnd	45	2844	2833	2878	Helen	"I shall ask no questions. I have it in [MASK] s writing that she and a man are in love. There is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that. All the rest isn t worth a straw.
HowardsEnd	49	3131	3114	3163	Helen	I understand it, but most good people would think you mad. Imagine how disconcerting for [MASK]! What is wanted is a person who will go slowly, slowly in this business, and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to."
HowardsEnd	51	3164	3133	3184	Margaret	What is wanted is a person who will go slowly, slowly in this business, and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to." [MASK] was down on this. "But you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off."
HowardsEnd	48	3422	3412	3460	Helen	It was rather difficult. Something must be done about [MASK]. She must be assured that it is not a criminal offence to love at first sight. A telegram to this effect would be cold and cryptic, a personal visit seemed each moment more impossible.
HowardsEnd	49	3469	3424	3473	Tibby	She must be assured that it is not a criminal offence to love at first sight. A telegram to this effect would be cold and cryptic, a personal visit seemed each moment more impossible. Now the doctor arrived, and said that [MASK] was quite bad.
HowardsEnd	44	3601	3597	3641	Helen	Give my letter to [MASK], and say whatever you feel yourself, but do keep clear of the relatives. We have scarcely got their names straight yet, and, besides, that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong."
HowardsEnd	56	3913	3881	3937	Margaret	And he is a chilly Londoner who does not endow his stations with some personality, and extend to them, however shyly, the emotions of fear and love. To [MASK]--I hope that it will not set the reader against her--the station of King s Cross had always suggested Infinity.
HowardsEnd	41	4254	4234	4275	Margaret	But her brother-in-law, who was peculiar and a German, had referred the question to [MASK], who with the crudity of youth had answered, "No, they could manage much better alone."
HowardsEnd	41	4346	4331	4372	Margaret	However, of course she did. She learnt, to her horror, that [MASK], now of age, was taking her money out of the old safe investments and putting it into Foreign Things, which always smash.
HowardsEnd	41	5189	5174	5215	well"--she	"The younger. Can I do anything for you?" "Oh, [MASK] controlled herself with difficulty. "Really. Are you? I--" She moved; away from the ticket boy and lowered her voice.
HowardsEnd	42	5587	5582	5624	Emerging	Just look sharp!" [MASK], he said in quieter tones: "This station s abominably organised; if I had my way, the whole lot of em should get the sack. May I help you in?"
HowardsEnd	53	6027	5977	6030	Margaret	It is rather a longer spin, but I have one or two commissions." "I should love going through the village. Naturally I am very anxious to talk things over with you." As she said this she felt ashamed, for she was disobeying [MASK] s instructions.
HowardsEnd	45	6040	6031	6076	Margaret	Only disobeying them in the letter, surely. [MASK] had only warned her against discussing the incident with outsiders. Surely it was not "uncivilised or wrong" to discuss it with the young man himself, since chance had thrown them together.
HowardsEnd	58	6264	6207	6265	Helen	He could not look her in the face, as his eyes were fixed on his work; he was travelling as quickly as he dared down the High Street. But he inclined his head in her direction, and said: "I beg your pardon; I didn t catch." "About [MASK].
HowardsEnd	52	6717	6714	6766	Paul	But you are [MASK]." "I m not." "Then why did you say so at the station?" "I said nothing of the sort." "I beg your pardon, you did." "I beg your pardon, I did not.
HowardsEnd	50	6770	6767	6817	Charles	My name is [MASK]." "Younger" may mean son as opposed to father, or second brother as opposed to first. There is much to be said for either view, and later on they said it. But they had other questions before them now.
HowardsEnd	53	6826	6773	6826	Paul--	"Younger" may mean son as opposed to father, or second brother as opposed to first. There is much to be said for either view, and later on they said it. But they had other questions before them now. "Do you mean to tell me that [MASK]
HowardsEnd	49	7106	7062	7111	Charles	The thing is impossible, and I will come up and stop it. My niece is a very exceptional person, and I am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her." [MASK] worked his jaws. "
HowardsEnd	42	7749	7738	7780	Paul	A very young man came out of the house. "[MASK], is there any truth in this?" "I didn t--I don t--" "Yes or no, man; plain question, plain answer.
HowardsEnd	49	8311	8310	8359	Helen	But [MASK] was a more serious patient. New ideas had burst upon her like a thunderclap, and by them and by their reverberations she had been stunned. The truth was that she had fallen in love, not with an individual, but with a family.
HowardsEnd	58	8361	8318	8376	Paul	New ideas had burst upon her like a thunderclap, and by them and by their reverberations she had been stunned. The truth was that she had fallen in love, not with an individual, but with a family. Before [MASK] arrived she had, as it were, been tuned up into his key.
HowardsEnd	54	8566	8565	8619	Charles	When [MASK] said, "Why be so polite to servants? they don t understand it," she had not given the Schlegel retort of, "If they don t understand it, I do." No; she had vowed to be less polite to servants in the future.
HowardsEnd	57	8660	8604	8661	Paul	" No; she had vowed to be less polite to servants in the future. "I am swathed in cant," she thought, "and it is good for me to be stripped of it." And all that she thought or did or breathed was a quiet preparation for [MASK].
HowardsEnd	50	8737	8689	8739	Evie	Round the absent brother she began to throw the halo of Romance, to irradiate him with all the splendour of those happy days, to feel that in him she should draw nearest to the robust ideal. He and she were about the same age, [MASK] said.
HowardsEnd	54	8891	8852	8906	Helen	Deep down in him something whispered, "This girl would let you kiss her; you might not have such a chance again." That was "how it happened," or, rather, how [MASK] described it to her sister, using words even more unsympathetic than my own.
HowardsEnd	47	9063	9042	9089	Helen	We do not admit that by collisions of this trivial sort the doors of heaven may be shaken open. To [MASK], at all events, her life was to bring nothing more intense than the embrace of this boy who played no part in it.
HowardsEnd	49	9188	9166	9215	Margaret--	In all the variable years that followed she never saw the like of it again. "I understand," said [MASK] "at least, I understand as much as ever is understood of these things. Tell me now what happened on the Monday morning."
HowardsEnd	47	9227	9216	9263	Helen	"It was over at once." "How, [MASK]?" "I was still happy while I dressed, but as I came downstairs I got nervous, and when I went into the dining-room I knew it was no good.
HowardsEnd	51	9485	9474	9525	Paul	"No, I don t really think that. But [MASK] was so broad-shouldered; all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse, and I knew that it would never do--never. I said to him after breakfast, when the others were practising strokes,
HowardsEnd	44	9972	9929	9973	Margaret	Ugh! but it has been a disgusting business. To think that--" She sighed. "To think that because you and a young man meet for a moment, there must be all these telegrams and anger," supplied [MASK].
HowardsEnd	48	9985	9977	10025	Helen	"I ve often thought about it, [MASK]. It s one of the most interesting things in the world. The truth is that there is a great outer life that you and I have never touched--a life in which telegrams and anger count.
HowardsEnd	50	10100	10081	10131	Meg--	It does breed character. Do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end?" "Oh, [MASK], that s what I felt, only not so clearly, when the Wilcoxes were so competent, and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes."
HowardsEnd	50	10215	10168	10218	Helen	I know that personal relations are the real life, for ever and ever." "Amen!" So the Wilcox episode fell into the background, leaving behind it memories of sweetness and horror that mingled, and the sisters pursued the life that [MASK] had commended.
HowardsEnd	42	10484	10469	10511	Kant	If one classed him at all it would be as the countryman of Hegel and [MASK], as the idealist, inclined to be dreamy, whose Imperialism was the Imperialism of the air. Not that his life had been inactive.
HowardsEnd	46	11071	11045	11091	Margaret	They collect facts, and facts, and empires of facts. But which of them will rekindle the light within?" To all this [MASK] listened, sitting on the haughty nephew s knee. It was a unique education for the little girls.
HowardsEnd	43	11164	11148	11191	Margaret	Were both these loud-voiced parties right? On one occasion they had met and [MASK] with clasped hands had implored them to argue the subject out in her presence. Whereat they blushed, and began to talk about the weather.
HowardsEnd	50	11336	11299	11349	Helen	Her brain darted up and down; it grew pliant and strong. Her conclusion was, that any human being lies nearer to the unseen than any organisation, and from this she never varied. [MASK] advanced along the same lines, though with a more irresponsible tread.
HowardsEnd	49	11544	11522	11571	Beethoven	He was now an intelligent man of sixteen, but dyspeptic and difficile. CHAPTER V It will be generally admitted that [MASK] s Fifth Symphony is the most sublime noise that has ever penetrated into the ear of man. All sorts and conditions are satisfied by it.
HowardsEnd	50	11850	11844	11894	Helen	"I expect so," [MASK] replied. Music enwrapped her, and she could not enter into the distinction that divides young men whom one takes an interest in from young men whom one knows. "You girls are so wonderful in always having--Oh dear!
HowardsEnd	52	12031	11980	12032	Helen	Much did she censure the attenuated Cupids who encircle the ceiling of the Queen s Hall, inclining each to each with vapid gesture, and clad in sallow pantaloons, on which the October sunlight struck. "How awful to marry a man like those Cupids!" thought [MASK].
HowardsEnd	49	12155	12145	12194	Beethoven	What diverse influences had gone to the making! Here [MASK], after humming and hawing with great sweetness, said "Heigho," and the Andante came to an end. Applause, and a round of "wunderschoning" and pracht volleying from the German contingent.
HowardsEnd	47	12290	12266	12313	Helen	"No; look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back," breathed [MASK], as the music started with a goblin walking quietly over the universe, from end to end. Others followed him.
HowardsEnd	53	12329	12314	12367	Helen	They were not aggressive creatures; it was that that made them so terrible to [MASK]. They merely observed in passing that there was no such thing as splendour or heroism in the world. After the interlude of elephants dancing, they returned and made the observation for the second time.
HowardsEnd	51	12435	12397	12448	Beethoven	Panic and emptiness! Panic and emptiness! The goblins were right. Her brother raised his finger; it was the transitional passage on the drum. For, as if things were going too far, [MASK] took hold of the goblins and made them do what he wanted.
HowardsEnd	50	12694	12676	12726	Beethoven	Panic and emptiness! Panic and emptiness! Even the flaming ramparts of the world might fall. [MASK] chose to make all right in the end. He built the ramparts up. He blew with his mouth for the second time, and again the goblins were scattered.
HowardsEnd	44	12953	12947	12991	Margaret	"Excuse me," said [MASK] s young man, who had for some time been preparing a sentence, "but that lady has, quite inadvertently, taken my umbrella." "Oh, good gracious me!--I am so sorry.
HowardsEnd	52	13013	12999	13051	Tibby	"I shall miss the Four Serious Songs if I do." "[MASK], love, you must go." "It isn t of any consequence," said the young man, in truth a little uneasy about his umbrella. "But of course it is.
HowardsEnd	50	13108	13075	13125	Helen	By the time he had tipped up the seat and had found his hat, and had deposited his full score in safety, it was "too late" to go after [MASK]. The Four Serious Songs had begun, and one could not move during their performance.
HowardsEnd	45	13135	13110	13155	Margaret	The Four Serious Songs had begun, and one could not move during their performance. "My sister is so careless," whispered [MASK]. "Not at all," replied the young man; but his voice was dead and cold.
HowardsEnd	41	13194	13156	13197	Margaret	"If you would give me your address--" "Oh, not at all, not at all;" and he wrapped his greatcoat over his knees. Then the Four Serious Songs rang shallow in [MASK] s ears.
HowardsEnd	54	13314	13311	13365	Brahms	As soon as [MASK] had grunted himself out, she gave him her card and said, "That is where we live; if you preferred, you could call for the umbrella after the concert, but I didn t like to trouble you when it has all been our fault."
HowardsEnd	56	14036	14029	14085	Margaret	So when the concert was over and [MASK] said, "We live quite near; I am going there now. Could you walk round with me, and we ll find your umbrella?" he said, "Thank you," peaceably, and followed her out of the Queen s Hall.
HowardsEnd	48	14231	14207	14255	Helen	"Do you go there much?" "When my work permits, I attend the gallery for the Royal Opera." [MASK] would have exclaimed, "So do I. I love the gallery," and thus have endeared herself to the young man.
HowardsEnd	45	14633	14598	14643	Tibby	I never could do that. But music is so different from pictures, to my mind. When it comes to music I am as safe as houses, and I assure you, [MASK], I am by no means pleased by everything.
HowardsEnd	51	14692	14685	14736	Margaret	"Do you agree?" asked [MASK]. "Do you think music is so different from pictures?" "I--I should have thought so, kind of," he said. "So should I. Now, my sister declares they re just the same.
HowardsEnd	50	14804	14775	14825	Helen	What is the good of the Arts if they re interchangeable? What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye? [MASK] s one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting, and pictures into the language of music.
HowardsEnd	50	15006	14957	15007	Wagner	He treats music as music, and oh, my goodness! He makes me angrier than any one, simply furious. With him I daren t even argue." An unhappy family, if talented. "But, of course, the real villain is [MASK].
HowardsEnd	51	15058	15026	15077	Wagner	I do feel that music is in a very serious state just now, though extraordinarily interesting. Every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses, like [MASK], who stir up all the wells of thought at once. For a moment it s splendid.
HowardsEnd	50	15124	15078	15128	Wagner	Such a splash as never was. But afterwards--such a lot of mud; and the wells--as it were, they communicate with each other too easily now, and not one of them will run quite clear. That s what [MASK] s done."
HowardsEnd	46	15417	15381	15427	Margaret	" There had always been something to worry him ever since he could remember, always something that distracted him in the pursuit of beauty. For he did pursue beauty, and, therefore, [MASK] s speeches did flutter away from him like birds.
HowardsEnd	54	15428	15428	15482	Margaret	[MASK] talked ahead, occasionally saying, "Don t you think so? don t you feel the same?" And once she stopped, and said, "Oh, do interrupt me!" which terrified him. She did not attract him, though she filled him with awe.
HowardsEnd	51	15643	15606	15657	Margaret	To the right the fantastic sky-line of the flats towered black against the hues of evening; to the left the older houses raised a square-cut, irregular parapet against the grey. [MASK] fumbled for her latch-key. Of course she had forgotten it.
HowardsEnd	50	15682	15658	15708	Helen	So, grasping her umbrella by its ferrule, she leant over the area and tapped at the dining-room window. "[MASK]! Let us in!" "All right," said a voice. "You ve been taking this gentleman s umbrella."
HowardsEnd	49	15716	15689	15738	Helen	"All right," said a voice. "You ve been taking this gentleman s umbrella." "Taken a what?" said [MASK], opening the door. "Oh, what s that? Do come in! How do you do?"
HowardsEnd	51	15740	15722	15773	Helen	"Oh, what s that? Do come in! How do you do?" "[MASK], you must not be so ramshackly. You took this gentleman s umbrella away from Queen s Hall, and he has had the trouble of coming round for it."
HowardsEnd	48	15784	15774	15822	Helen	"Oh, I am so sorry!" cried [MASK], all her hair flying. She had pulled off her hat as soon as she returned, and had flung herself into the big dining-room chair. "I do nothing but steal umbrellas.
HowardsEnd	52	15872	15836	15888	Helen	Is yours a hooky or a nobbly? Mine s a nobbly--at least, I THINK it is." The light was turned on, and they began to search the hall, [MASK], who had abruptly parted with the Fifth Symphony, commenting with shrill little cries.
HowardsEnd	46	15949	15949	15995	Tibby	[MASK], why don t you ever--No, I can t remember what I was going to say. That wasn t it, but do tell the maids to hurry tea up. What about this umbrella?" She opened it. "
HowardsEnd	52	16056	16006	16058	Margaret	It s an appalling umbrella. It must be mine." But it was not. He took it from her, murmured a few words of thanks, and then fled, with the lilting step of the clerk. "But if you will stop--" cried [MASK]. "
HowardsEnd	50	16061	16059	16109	Helen	Now, [MASK], how stupid you ve been!" "Whatever have I done?" "Don t you see that you ve frightened him away? I meant him to stop to tea. You oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella.
HowardsEnd	51	16132	16097	16148	Helen	You oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella. I saw his nice eyes getting so miserable. No, it s not a bit of good now." For [MASK] had darted out into the street, shouting, "Oh, do stop!"
HowardsEnd	45	16245	16202	16247	Helen	You make me more and more ashamed. I d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that I--Well, I must shut the front-door, I suppose. One more failure for [MASK]."
HowardsEnd	54	16264	16248	16302	Margaret	"Yes, I think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent," said [MASK]. Seeing that her aunt did not understand, she added: "You remember rent ? It was one of father s words--Rent to the ideal, to his own faith in human nature.
HowardsEnd	57	16628	16607	16664	Tibby	And when they joined him she said rather sharply: "Why didn t you make that young man welcome, [MASK]? You must do the host a little, you know. You ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping, instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women."
HowardsEnd	48	16665	16630	16678	Tibby	You must do the host a little, you know. You ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping, instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women." [MASK] sighed, and drew a long strand of hair over his forehead.
HowardsEnd	49	16787	16741	16790	Helen	"How can you say such dreadful things! The number of men you get here has always astonished me. If there is any danger it s the other way round." "Yes, but it s the wrong sort of men, [MASK] means."
HowardsEnd	43	16823	16802	16845	Tibby	"We get the right sort of man, but the wrong side of him, and I say that s [MASK] s fault. There ought to be a something about the house--an--I don t know what."
HowardsEnd	48	17118	17071	17119	Tibby	Just as another house that I can mention, but won t, sounded irrevocably masculine, and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal." "That house being the W s house, I presume," said [MASK].
HowardsEnd	47	17137	17120	17167	Helen	"You re not going to be told about the W s, my child," [MASK] cried, "so don t you think it. And on the other hand, I don t the least mind if you find out, so don t
HowardsEnd	51	17198	17148	17199	Margaret	And on the other hand, I don t the least mind if you find out, so don t you think you ve done anything clever, in either case. Give me a cigarette." "You do what you can for the house," said [MASK].
HowardsEnd	55	17406	17369	17424	Margaret	Beyond them the thoroughfare roared gently--a tide that could never be quiet, while in the east, invisible behind the smokes of Wapping, the moon was rising. "That reminds me, [MASK]. We might have taken that young man into the dining-room, at all events.
HowardsEnd	50	18713	18698	18748	Leonard	It had been too easily gained, and could be relinquished too easily. As [MASK] was kicking off his boots he jarred the three-legged table, and a photograph frame, honourably poised upon it, slid sideways, fell off into the fireplace, and smashed.
HowardsEnd	52	18858	18819	18871	Jacky	Take my word for it, that smile was simply stunning, and it is only you and I who will be fastidious, and complain that true joy begins in the eyes, and that the eyes of [MASK] did not accord with her smile, but were anxious and hungry.
HowardsEnd	54	18872	18872	18926	Leonard	[MASK] tried to pull out the fragments of glass, and cut his fingers and swore again. A drop of blood fell on the frame, another followed, spilling over on to the exposed photograph. He swore more vigorously, and dashed into the kitchen, where he bathed his hands.
HowardsEnd	49	19080	19032	19081	Ruskin	He drank a little tea, black and silent, that still survived upon an upper shelf. He swallowed some dusty crumbs of a cake. Then he went back to the sitting-room, settled himself anew, and began to read a volume of [MASK].
HowardsEnd	58	19429	19374	19432	Leonard	" Those were the words for him. And the voice in the gondola rolled on, piping melodiously of Effort and Self-Sacrifice, full of high purpose, full of beauty, full even of sympathy and the love of men, yet somehow eluding all that was actual and insistent in [MASK] s life.
HowardsEnd	56	19642	19609	19665	Leonard	Fiat, but then, mind you, he s had luck... I m sorry the wife s so late, but she never has any luck over catching trains." [MASK] was superior to these people; he did believe in effort and in a steady preparation for the change that he desired.
HowardsEnd	53	19986	19945	19998	Jacky	The face--the face does not signify. It was the face of the photograph, but older, and the teeth were not so numerous as the photographer had suggested, and certainly not so white. Yes, [MASK] was past her prime, whatever that prime may have been.
HowardsEnd	43	20026	19999	20042	Leonard	She was descending quicker than most women into the colourless years, and the look in her eyes confessed it. "What ho!" said [MASK], greeting the apparition with much spirit, and helping it off with its boa.
HowardsEnd	48	20263	20228	20276	Jacky	"I ve been out to tea at a lady friend s." Her secret being at last given--to the world, and the name of the lady friend being even adumbrated, [MASK] made no further experiments in the difficult and tiring art of conversation.
HowardsEnd	53	20435	20402	20455	Margaret	Then she said, "Is that a book you re reading?" and he said, "That s a book," and drew it from her unreluctant grasp. [MASK] s card fell out of it. It fell face downwards, and he murmured, "Bookmarker."
HowardsEnd	50	20457	20443	20493	Len--	It fell face downwards, and he murmured, "Bookmarker." "[MASK]" "What is it?" he asked, a little wearily, for she only had one topic of conversation when she sat upon his knee. "You do love me?"
HowardsEnd	45	20495	20465	20510	Jacky	he asked, a little wearily, for she only had one topic of conversation when she sat upon his knee. "You do love me?" "[MASK], you know that I do. How can you ask such questions!"
HowardsEnd	49	20518	20503	20552	Len	How can you ask such questions!" "But you do love me, [MASK], don t you?" "Of course I do." A pause. The other remark was still due. "Len--" "Well? What is it?"
HowardsEnd	51	20554	20535	20586	Len	The other remark was still due. "Len--" "Well? What is it?" "[MASK], you will make it all right?" "I can t have you ask me that again," said the boy, flaring up into a sudden passion.
HowardsEnd	49	20680	20636	20685	Jacky	I ve worries enough. It isn t likely I d throw you over, let alone my word, when I ve spent all this money. Besides, I m an Englishman, and I never go back on my word. [MASK], do be reasonable.
HowardsEnd	48	20706	20693	20741	Len	Only do stop badgering me." "When s your birthday, [MASK]?" "I ve told you again and again, the eleventh of November next. Now get off my knee a bit; some one must get supper, I suppose."
HowardsEnd	42	20742	20724	20766	Jacky	Now get off my knee a bit; some one must get supper, I suppose." [MASK] went through to the bedroom, and began to see to her hat. This meant blowing at it with short sharp puffs.
HowardsEnd	48	20767	20757	20805	Leonard	This meant blowing at it with short sharp puffs. [MASK] tidied up the sitting-room, and began to prepare their evening meal. He put a penny into the slot of the gas-meter, and soon the flat was reeking with metallic fumes.
HowardsEnd	43	20965	20923	20966	Jacky	He lowered his voice. "He d stop it." In a tone of horror, that was a little luxurious, he repeated: "My brother d stop it. I m going against the whole world, [MASK].
HowardsEnd	48	20974	20967	21015	Jacky	"That s what I am, [MASK]. I don t take any heed of what any one says. I just go straight forward, I do. That s always been my way. I m not one of your weak knock-kneed chaps.
HowardsEnd	51	21128	21110	21161	Jacky	I can tell you, I enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon." To all his moods [MASK] remained equally indifferent. When supper was ready--and not before--she emerged from the bedroom, saying: "But you do love me, don t you?"
HowardsEnd	45	21170	21133	21178	Leonard	When supper was ready--and not before--she emerged from the bedroom, saying: "But you do love me, don t you?" They began with a soup square, which [MASK] had just dissolved in some hot water.
HowardsEnd	53	21225	21179	21232	Leonard	It was followed by the tongue--a freckled cylinder of meat, with a little jelly at the top, and a great deal of yellow fat at the bottom--ending with another square dissolved in water (jelly: pineapple), which [MASK] had prepared earlier in the day.
HowardsEnd	50	21397	21397	21447	Jacky	[MASK] followed this, and said that, for her part, she thought it a lovely tune. "No; I ll play you something lovely. Get up, dear, for a minute." He went to the piano and jingled out a little Grieg.
HowardsEnd	48	21464	21426	21474	Jacky	Get up, dear, for a minute." He went to the piano and jingled out a little Grieg. He played badly and vulgarly, but the performance was not without its effect, for [MASK] said she thought she d be going to bed.
HowardsEnd	57	21664	21609	21666	Len	Oh, it was no good, this continual aspiration. Some are born cultured; the rest had better go in for whatever comes easy. To see life steadily and to see it whole was not for the likes of him. From the darkness beyond the kitchen a voice called, "[MASK]?"
HowardsEnd	51	22219	22204	22255	Helen	"For a clever girl, dear, how very oddly you do talk. [MASK] ll HAVE to have something more to do with them, now that they re all opposite. She may meet that Paul in the street. She cannot very well not bow."
HowardsEnd	48	22315	22294	22342	Helen	I look on that disastrous episode (over which you were so kind) as the killing of a nerve in [MASK]. It s dead, and she ll never be troubled with it again. The only things that matter are the things that interest one.
HowardsEnd	43	22509	22483	22526	Margaret	She didn t answer it." "How very rude!" "I wonder. Or was it sensible?" "No, [MASK], most rude." "In either case one can class it as reassuring."
HowardsEnd	47	22565	22550	22597	Charles	Other regrets crowded upon her: for instance, how magnificently she would have cut [MASK] if she had met him face to face. She had already seen him, giving an order to the porter--and very common he looked in a tall hat.
HowardsEnd	45	23199	23173	23218	Charles	Such an experience! Such awful coarse-grained people! I know more about them than you do, which you forget, and if [MASK] had taken you that motor drive--well, you d have reached the house a perfect wreck.
HowardsEnd	51	23681	23667	23718	Margaret	"I hope to risk things all my life." "Oh, [MASK], most dangerous." "But after all," she continued with a smile, "there s never any great risk as long as you have money." "Oh, shame!
HowardsEnd	52	23900	23887	23939	Helen	"I call that rather cynical." "So do I. But [MASK] and I, we ought to remember, when we are tempted to criticise others, that we are standing on these islands, and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea.
HowardsEnd	45	24209	24200	24245	Helen	Oh!--" "What is it?" "[MASK] was looking up at the Wilcoxes flat." "Why shouldn t she?" "I beg your pardon, I interrupted you. What was it you were saying about reality?"
HowardsEnd	50	24259	24226	24276	Margaret	"I beg your pardon, I interrupted you. What was it you were saying about reality?" "I had worked round to myself, as usual," answered [MASK] in tones that were suddenly preoccupied. "Do tell me this, at all events.
HowardsEnd	47	24705	24697	24744	Journalism	They were--she saw it clearly--[MASK]; her father, with all his defects and wrong-headedness, had been Literature, and had he lived, he would have persuaded his daughter rightly. The registry office was holding its morning reception.
HowardsEnd	42	24826	24785	24827	Helen	Her failure depressed her, and though she forgot the failure, the depression remained. On her way home she again glanced up at the Wilcoxes flat, and took the rather matronly step of speaking about the matter to [MASK].
HowardsEnd	52	25118	25107	25159	Helen	I shouldn t have referred to it otherwise." But [MASK] s laugh rang true, as she raised a soapy hand to heaven and swore that never, nowhere and nohow, would she again fall in love with any of the Wilcox family, down to its remotest collaterals.
HowardsEnd	53	25219	25195	25248	Helen	Perhaps the elder lady, as she gazed at the vulgar, ruddy cathedral, and listened to the talk of her husband and [MASK], may have detected in the other and less charming of the sisters a deeper sympathy, a sounder judgment. She was capable of detecting such things.
HowardsEnd	49	25653	25635	25684	Tibby	I vow tis my brother. O crimini!" A male--even such a male as [MASK]--was enough to stop the foolery. The barrier of sex, though decreasing among the civilised, is still high, and higher on the side of women.
HowardsEnd	53	25736	25730	25783	Tibby	Nor was it precaution, for [MASK] seldom repeated any news that did not concern himself. It was rather the feeling that she betrayed a secret into the camp of men, and that, however trivial it was on this side of the barrier, it would become important on that.
HowardsEnd	55	25882	25846	25901	Tibby	"Yes, I know; thanks very much." "I thought I did right to tell you." "Ever so many thanks." "What s that?" asked [MASK]. No one told him, and he proceeded into the dining-room, to eat plums.
HowardsEnd	46	25961	25961	26007	Margaret	[MASK] sat by him, thinking. Her mind darted from impulse to impulse, and finally marshalled them all in review. The practical person, who knows what he wants at once, and generally knows nothing else, will accuse her of indecision.
HowardsEnd	55	26418	26416	26471	Margaret	Rudeness affected [MASK] like a bitter taste in the mouth. It poisoned life. At times it is necessary, but woe to those who employ it without due need. She flung on a hat and shawl, just like a poor woman, and plunged into the fog, which still continued.
HowardsEnd	47	26752	26732	26779	Margaret	It is good of you to have come round so promptly." "It does matter," cried [MASK]. "I have been rude to you; and my sister is not even at home, so there was not even that excuse."
HowardsEnd	51	26830	26793	26844	Margaret	"She gone as well," murmured the other. "Yes, certainly, it is quite safe--safe, absolutely, now." "You ve been worrying too!" exclaimed [MASK], getting more and more excited, and taking a chair without invitation.
HowardsEnd	47	26947	26908	26955	Paul	"I think you put it best in your letter--it was an instinct, which may be wrong." "It wasn t that your son still--" "Oh no; he often--my [MASK] is very young, you see."
HowardsEnd	50	27076	27043	27093	Helen	I was merely alarmed when I knew that my boy cared for your sister." "Ah, I have always been wanting to ask you. How DID you know? [MASK] was so surprised when our aunt drove up, and you stepped forward and arranged things.
HowardsEnd	47	27404	27380	27427	Paul	Not to mention people." "The truth is, I am a little tired. First came the wedding, and then [MASK] went off, and, instead of resting yesterday, I paid a round of calls." "A wedding?"
HowardsEnd	43	27458	27441	27484	Paul	"Indeed!" "We took the flat chiefly on that account, and also that [MASK] could get his African outfit. The flat belongs to a cousin of my husband s, and she most kindly offered it to us.
HowardsEnd	44	27498	27465	27509	Dolly	The flat belongs to a cousin of my husband s, and she most kindly offered it to us. So before the day came we were able to make the acquaintance of [MASK] s people, which we had not yet done."
HowardsEnd	42	27555	27521	27563	Helen	The father is in the Indian army--retired; the brother is in the army. The mother is dead." So perhaps these were the "chinless sunburnt men" whom [MASK] had espied one afternoon through the window.
HowardsEnd	45	27686	27672	27717	Dolly	They belong to the same club, and are both devoted to golf. [MASK] plays golf too, though I believe not so well; and they first met in a mixed foursome. We all like her, and are very much pleased.
HowardsEnd	45	28089	28070	28115	Margaret	The last words had an indescribable ring about them. "Where s the pony gone?" asked [MASK] after a pause. "The pony? Oh, dead, ever so long ago." "The wych-elm I remember.
HowardsEnd	50	28490	28454	28504	Margaret	You have cheered me up." "I m so glad!" "I--I wonder whether you ever think about yourself?" "I think of nothing else," said [MASK], blushing, but letting her hand remain in that of the invalid.
HowardsEnd	57	28531	28521	28578	Margaret	"I almost think--" "Yes?" asked [MASK], for there was a long pause--a pause that was somehow akin to the flicker of the fire, the quiver of the reading-lamp upon their hands, the white blur from the window; a pause of shifting and eternal shadows.
HowardsEnd	42	28699	28684	28726	Helen	"Oh, I ve got it--inexperience. I m no better than [MASK], you mean, and yet I presume to advise her." "Yes. You have got it. Inexperience is the word."
HowardsEnd	43	29111	29100	29143	Margaret	The delightful people darted after it with cries of joy, [MASK] leading them, and not till the meal was half over did they realise that the principal guest had taken no part in the chase. There was no common topic.
HowardsEnd	48	29697	29693	29741	Germans	Now don t say [MASK] have no taste, or I shall scream. They haven t. But--but--such a tremendous but!--they take poetry seriously. They do take poetry seriously." "Is anything gained by that?" "Yes, yes.
HowardsEnd	51	30156	30129	30180	Margaret	She was not intellectual, nor even alert, and it was odd that, all the same, she should give the idea of greatness. [MASK], zigzagging with her friends over Thought and Art, was conscious of a personality that transcended their own and dwarfed their activities.
HowardsEnd	48	31070	31047	31095	Margaret	They were silent for a moment. Then, with a newborn emotion, they shook hands. The conversation ceased suddenly when [MASK] re-entered the dining-room; her friends had been talking over her new friend, and had dismissed her as uninteresting.
HowardsEnd	42	31426	31419	31461	Margaret	"First of all," began [MASK], "we must make a list and tick off the people s names. My aunt always does, and this fog may thicken up any moment. Have you any ideas?"
HowardsEnd	50	31543	31497	31547	Margaret	The din is so confusing, and your aunt is quite right--one ought to make a list. Take my notebook, then, and write your own name at the top of the page." "Oh, hooray!" said [MASK], writing it.
HowardsEnd	54	31681	31637	31691	Christmas	A certain austerity of demeanour was best, and she added: "I don t really want a Yuletide gift, though. In fact, I d rather not." "Why?" "Because I ve odd ideas about [MASK]. Because I have all that money can buy.
HowardsEnd	49	31765	31757	31806	Margaret	"If that is so," said [MASK], "if I have happened to be of use to you, which I didn t know, you cannot pay me back with anything tangible." "I suppose not, but one would like to.
HowardsEnd	50	31929	31907	31957	Margaret	"We always give the servants money." "Yes, do you, yes, much easier," replied [MASK] but felt the grotesque impact of the unseen upon the seen, and saw issuing from a forgotten manger at Bethlehem this torrent of coins and toys.
HowardsEnd	52	32029	31996	32048	Margaret	A poster of a woman in tights heralded the Christmas pantomime, and little red devils, who had come in again that year, were prevalent upon the Christmas-cards. [MASK] was no morbid idealist. She did not wish this spate of business and self-advertisement checked.
HowardsEnd	49	32559	32513	32562	Bertha	"If possible, something distinctive," she sighed. At the counter she found a friend, bent on the same errand, and conversed with her insipidly, wasting much time. "My husband and our daughter are motoring." "[MASK], too?
HowardsEnd	49	32684	32666	32715	Evie	There s plenty of time still, isn t there, and I shall be able to get [MASK] s opinion." They returned to the carriage by devious paths; when they were in, she said, "But couldn t you get it renewed?"
HowardsEnd	50	32724	32689	32739	Margaret	They returned to the carriage by devious paths; when they were in, she said, "But couldn t you get it renewed?" "I beg your pardon?" asked [MASK]. "The lease, I mean." "Oh, the lease!
HowardsEnd	48	32907	32866	32914	Margaret	I would rather die than--Oh, poor girls! Can what they call civilisation be right, if people mayn t die in the room where they were born? My dear, I am so sorry." [MASK] did not know what to say.
HowardsEnd	57	33010	32960	33017	Margaret	We are fond of ours, but there is nothing distinctive about it. As you saw, it is an ordinary London house. We shall easily find another." "So you think." "Again my lack of experience, I suppose!" said [MASK], easing away from the subject.
HowardsEnd	49	33126	33093	33142	Margaret	"I want you to see it. You have never seen it. I want to hear what you say about it, for you do put things so wonderfully." [MASK] glanced at the pitiless air and then at the tired face of her companion. "
HowardsEnd	48	33296	33251	33299	Margaret	"Not at all." "It is such a comfort to get the presents off my mind--the Christmas-cards especially. I do admire your choice." It was her turn to receive no answer. In her turn [MASK] became annoyed.
HowardsEnd	51	33788	33774	33825	Tibby	At lunch her brother, seeing her inclined for silence insisted on talking. [MASK] was not ill-natured, but from babyhood something drove him to do the unwelcome and the unexpected. Now he gave her a long account of the day-school that he sometimes patronised.
HowardsEnd	54	34184	34157	34211	Margaret	As she did so, a grave and happy voice saluted her and thanked her. "I will come if I still may," said [MASK], laughing nervously. "You are coming to sleep, dear, too. It is in the morning that my house is most beautiful.
HowardsEnd	50	34600	34559	34609	Margaret	Of course." "--But as we ve insured against third party risks, it won t so much matter--" "--Cart and car being practically at right angles--" The voices of the happy family rose high. [MASK] was left alone. No one wanted her.
HowardsEnd	49	35099	35095	35144	Hilton	The sun set over [MASK]; the grey brows of the evening flushed a little, and were cleft with one scarlet frown. Chattering sadly to each other, the mourners passed through the lych-gate and traversed the chestnut avenues that led down to the village.
HowardsEnd	42	35570	35570	35612	Ruth	[MASK] knew no more of worldly wickedness and wisdom than did the flowers in her garden, or the grass in her field. Her idea of business--"Henry, why do people who have enough money try to get more money?"
HowardsEnd	55	35717	35680	35735	Charles	The rector s sermons had at first repelled her, and she had expressed a desire for "a more inward light," adding, "not so much for myself as for baby" ([MASK]). Inward light must have been granted, for he heard no complaints in later years.
HowardsEnd	43	35914	35887	35930	Evie	It was the only time she had deceived him in those thirty years. He rose to his feet and looked out of the window, for [MASK] had come in with the letters, and he could meet no one s eye.
HowardsEnd	49	36062	36055	36104	Charles	The forehead, too, was like [MASK] s. High and straight, brown and polished, merging abruptly into temples and skull, it had the effect of a bastion that protected his head from the world. At times it had the effect of a blank wall.
HowardsEnd	49	36129	36105	36154	Evie	He had dwelt behind it, intact and happy, for fifty years. "The post s come, father," said [MASK] awkwardly. "Thanks. Put it down." "Has the breakfast been all right?" "Yes, thanks."
HowardsEnd	51	36175	36132	36183	Charles	"Thanks. Put it down." "Has the breakfast been all right?" "Yes, thanks." The girl glanced at him and at it with constraint. She did not know what to do. "[MASK] says do you want the Times?"
HowardsEnd	59	36501	36463	36522	Charles	Crumbling her toast, and too nervous to ask for the butter, she remained almost motionless, thankful only for this, that her father-in-law was having his breakfast upstairs. At last [MASK] spoke. "They had no business to be pollarding those elms yesterday," he said to his sister.
HowardsEnd	50	36598	36598	36648	Charles--	[MASK]" "Yes, dear?" "I didn t know one could pollard elms. I thought one only pollarded willows." "Oh no, one can pollard elms." "Then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded?"
HowardsEnd	48	36649	36616	36664	Charles	I thought one only pollarded willows." "Oh no, one can pollard elms." "Then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded?" [MASK] frowned a little, and turned again to his sister. "Another point.
HowardsEnd	52	36769	36764	36816	Helen	Or it may be as [MASK] supposed: they realised its importance, but were afraid of it. Panic and emptiness, could one glance behind. They were not callous, and they left the breakfast-table with aching hearts. Their mother never had come in to breakfast.
HowardsEnd	47	36838	36817	36864	Charles	It was in the other rooms, and especially in the garden, that they felt her loss most. As [MASK] went out to the garage, he was reminded at every step of the woman who had loved him and whom he could never replace.
HowardsEnd	47	36960	36957	37004	Evie	And so with [MASK], as she stood talking to the cook. Though she could take up her mother s work inside the house, just as the man could take it up without, she felt that something unique had fallen out of her life.
HowardsEnd	59	37117	37061	37120	Charles	There were no legacies, no annuities, none of the posthumous bustle with which some of the dead prolong their activities. Trusting her husband, she had left him everything without reserve. She was quite a poor woman--the house had been all her dowry, and the house would come to [MASK] in time.
HowardsEnd	50	37410	37390	37440	Charles	my new car s been driven!" "Has it, sir?" "Yes," said [MASK], getting rather red; "and whoever s driven it hasn t cleaned it properly, for there s mud on the axle. Take it off."
HowardsEnd	52	37467	37441	37493	Charles	The man went for the cloths without a word. He was a chauffeur as ugly as sin--not that this did him disservice with [MASK], who thought charm in a man rather rot, and had soon got rid of the little Italian beast with whom they had started.
HowardsEnd	47	37727	37719	37766	Charles	No more mud now, sir." [MASK] was vexed. The man was treating him as a fool, and if his heart had not been so heavy he would have reported him to his father. But it was not a morning for complaints.
HowardsEnd	52	37956	37906	37958	Charles	" When they were out of the chauffeur s sight he put his arm round her waist and pressed her against him. All his affection and half his attention--it was what he granted her throughout their happy married life. "But you haven t listened, [MASK]."
HowardsEnd	43	38006	37993	38036	Charles	"What the dickens are you talking about?" "Now, [MASK], you promised not to say those naughty--" "Look here, I m in no mood for foolery. It s no morning for it either."
HowardsEnd	44	38185	38178	38222	Dolly	and as if to complete chaos, [MASK] said, "Oh no, the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her." "Come in, all three of you!" cried his father, no longer inert.
HowardsEnd	51	38312	38267	38318	Charles	Come in." He stood in the porch, transformed, letters in his hand. "Into the dining-room, every one of you. We can t discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants. Here, [MASK], here; read these.
HowardsEnd	52	38444	38441	38493	Evie	"Come, [MASK], don t waste time, sit--down." In silence they drew up to the breakfast-table. The events of yesterday--indeed, of this morning suddenly receded into a past so remote that they seemed scarcely to have lived in it.
HowardsEnd	41	38504	38494	38535	Charles	Heavy breathings were heard. They were calming themselves. [MASK], to steady them further, read the enclosure out loud: "A note in my mother s handwriting, in an envelope addressed to my father, sealed.
HowardsEnd	50	38595	38586	38636	Charles	Houses ought to be done by a lawyer, [MASK], surely." Her husband worked his jaw severely. Little lumps appeared in front of either ear--a symptom that she had not yet learnt to respect, and she asked whether she might see the note.
HowardsEnd	47	38637	38607	38654	Charles	Little lumps appeared in front of either ear--a symptom that she had not yet learnt to respect, and she asked whether she might see the note. [MASK] looked at his father for permission, who said abstractedly, "Give it her."
HowardsEnd	43	38763	38763	38806	Charles	[MASK], vexed both with his father and his wife, then repeated: "The question is--" He had cleared a space of the breakfast-table from plates and knives, so that he could draw patterns on the tablecloth.
HowardsEnd	53	38929	38918	38971	Dolly	"Why, you just said it was!" cried [MASK]. "Never mind if I did," he blazed out; "and hold your tongue." The poor little wife coloured at this, and, drawing her handkerchief from her pocket, shed a few tears.
HowardsEnd	48	38977	38950	38998	Evie	The poor little wife coloured at this, and, drawing her handkerchief from her pocket, shed a few tears. No one noticed her. [MASK] was scowling like an angry boy. The two men were gradually assuming the manner of the committee-room.
HowardsEnd	54	39053	39034	39088	Charles	Caligraphy was the item before them now, and on it they turned their well-trained brains. [MASK], after a little demur, accepted the writing as genuine, and they passed on to the next point. It is the best--perhaps the only--way of dodging emotion.
HowardsEnd	50	39153	39131	39181	Unnoticed	The clock ticked, the coals blazed higher, and contended with the white radiance that poured in through the windows. [MASK], the sun occupied his sky, and the shadows of the tree stems, extraordinarily solid, fell like trenches of purple across the frosted lawn.
HowardsEnd	54	39189	39189	39243	Evie	[MASK] s fox terrier, who had passed for white, was only a dirty grey dog now, so intense was the purity that surrounded him. He was discredited, but the blackbirds that he was chasing glowed with Arabian darkness, for all the conventional colouring of life had been altered.
HowardsEnd	51	39297	39257	39308	Margaret	Other clocks confirmed it, and the discussion moved towards its close. To follow it is unnecessary. It is rather a moment when the commentator should step forward. Ought the Wilcoxes to have offered their home to [MASK]? I think not. The appeal was too flimsy.
HowardsEnd	51	39583	39541	39592	Grief	They did neglect a personal appeal. The woman who had died did say to them, "Do this," and they answered, "We will not." The incident made a most painful impression on them. [MASK] mounted into the brain and worked there disquietingly.
HowardsEnd	53	39979	39971	40024	Charles	"That time may prove," murmured [MASK]. "How?" asked his sister. "Presumably she knows--mother will have told her. She got twice or three times into the nursing home. Presumably she is awaiting developments." "What a horrid woman!"
HowardsEnd	48	40026	40000	40048	Dolly	She got twice or three times into the nursing home. Presumably she is awaiting developments." "What a horrid woman!" And [MASK], who had recovered, cried, "Why, she may be coming down to turn us out now!"
HowardsEnd	42	40049	40049	40091	Charles	[MASK] put her right. "I wish she would," he said ominously. "I could then deal with her." "So could I," echoed his father, who was feeling rather in the cold.
HowardsEnd	55	40092	40092	40147	Charles	[MASK] had been kind in undertaking the funeral arrangements and in telling him to eat his breakfast, but the boy as he grew up was a little dictatorial, and assumed the post of chairman too readily. "I could deal with her, if she comes, but she won t come.
HowardsEnd	55	40299	40258	40313	Charles	She did not hide anything from us, for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are. She, like ourselves, was a dupe--" He stopped for a moment. "You see, [MASK], in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions.
HowardsEnd	51	40483	40467	40518	Charles	"That would explain a lot." "She s a cosmopolitan," said [MASK], looking at his watch. "I admit I m rather down on cosmopolitans. My fault, doubtless. I cannot stand them, and a German cosmopolitan is the limit.
HowardsEnd	48	40537	40490	40538	Chalkeley	"I admit I m rather down on cosmopolitans. My fault, doubtless. I cannot stand them, and a German cosmopolitan is the limit. I think that s about all, isn t it? I want to run down and see [MASK].
HowardsEnd	50	40556	40544	40594	Crane	And, by the way, I wish you d speak to [MASK] some time. I m certain he s had my new car out." "Has he done it any harm?" "No." "In that case I shall let it pass.
HowardsEnd	51	40605	40560	40611	Charles	I m certain he s had my new car out." "Has he done it any harm?" "No." "In that case I shall let it pass. It s not worth while having a row." [MASK] and his father sometimes disagreed.
HowardsEnd	58	40753	40717	40775	Paul	Her mind was bent on other questions now, and by her also it would have been rejected as the fantasy of an invalid. She was parting from these Wilcoxes for the second time. [MASK] and his mother, ripple and great wave, had flowed into her life and ebbed out of it for ever.
HowardsEnd	53	41282	41230	41283	Charles	She had seen so much of them in the final week. They were not "her sort," they were often suspicious and stupid, and deficient where she excelled; but collision with them stimulated her, and she felt an interest that verged into liking, even for [MASK].
HowardsEnd	47	41446	41412	41459	Margaret	It fostered such virtues as neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second rank, no doubt, but they have formed our civilisation. They form character, too; [MASK] could not doubt it; they keep the soul from becoming sloppy.
HowardsEnd	50	41487	41476	41526	Helen	"Don t brood too much," she wrote to [MASK], "on the superiority of the unseen to the seen. It s true, but to brood on it is medieval. Our business is not to contrast the two, but to reconcile them."
HowardsEnd	49	41527	41500	41549	Helen	It s true, but to brood on it is medieval. Our business is not to contrast the two, but to reconcile them." [MASK] replied that she had no intention of brooding on such a dull subject. What did her sister take her for?
HowardsEnd	44	42169	42148	42192	Tibby	The men were down, and the candidates had been housed in various colleges, and had dined in hall. [MASK] was sensitive to beauty, the experience was new, and he gave a description of his visit that was almost glowing.
HowardsEnd	57	42287	42262	42319	Tibby	Perhaps it wants its inmates to love it rather than to love one another; such at all events was to be its effect on [MASK]. His sisters sent him there that he might make friends, for they knew that his education had been cranky, and had severed him from other boys and men.
HowardsEnd	44	42356	42354	42398	Margaret	It pleased [MASK] to hear her brother and sister talking. They did not get on overwell as a rule. For a few moments she listened to them, feeling elderly and benign. Then something occurred to her, and she interrupted.
HowardsEnd	50	42491	42488	42538	Charles	"I hope [MASK] took the hint." "Yes--that is to say, her husband wrote later on, and thanked me for being a little kind to her, and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette. Don t you think that is extraordinarily generous?
HowardsEnd	47	42571	42530	42577	Evie	Don t you think that is extraordinarily generous? It has made me like him very much. He hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance, but that you and I will go and stop with [MASK] some time in the future.
HowardsEnd	46	42706	42698	42744	Margaret	Looking back on the past six months, [MASK] realised the chaotic nature of our daily life, and its difference from the orderly sequence that has been fabricated by historians. Actual life is full of false clues and sign-posts that lead nowhere.
HowardsEnd	54	42903	42872	42926	Margaret	It is indeed unmanageable, but the essence of it is not a battle. It is unmanageable because it is a romance, and its essence is romantic beauty. [MASK] hoped that for the future she would be less cautious, not more cautious, than she had been in the past.
HowardsEnd	44	43255	43250	43294	Nature	It lies beyond everything; [MASK], with all her cruelty, comes nearer to us than do these crowds of men. A friend explains himself; the earth is explicable--from her we came, and we must return to her.
HowardsEnd	51	43704	43693	43744	Tibby	Did he at all know where he wanted to live? [MASK] didn t know that he did know. Did he at all know what he wanted to do? He was equally uncertain, but when pressed remarked that he should prefer to be quite free of any profession.
HowardsEnd	41	44047	44031	44072	Tibby	"I have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude," enunciated [MASK]. "Then we ll leave the subject till you do. I m not going to rattle you round. Take your time.
HowardsEnd	47	44299	44254	44301	Helen	"Labouring under such a delusion, why do you not marry?" "I sometimes jolly well think I would if I got the chance." "Has nobody arst you?" "Only ninnies." "Do people ask [MASK]?"
HowardsEnd	48	44488	44477	44525	Tibby	he protested, suddenly sitting up, alert and angry. [MASK], for all his defects, had a genuine personality. "Well, they re as near the right sort as you can imagine." "No, no--oh, no!"
HowardsEnd	50	44650	44640	44690	Margaret	"I can t bother over results," said [MASK], a little sadly. "They are too difficult for me. I can only look at the men. An Empire bores me, so far, but I can appreciate the heroism that builds it up.
HowardsEnd	51	44752	44724	44775	Tibby	I want activity without civilisation. How paradoxical! Yet I expect that is what we shall find in heaven." "And I," said [MASK], "want civilisation without activity, which, I expect, is what we shall find in the other place."
HowardsEnd	51	44969	44958	45009	Helen	As she spoke, the door was flung open, and [MASK] burst in in a state of extreme excitement. "Oh, my dears, what do you think? You ll never guess. A woman s been here asking me for her husband. Her WHAT?"
HowardsEnd	55	45011	44979	45034	Helen	"Oh, my dears, what do you think? You ll never guess. A woman s been here asking me for her husband. Her WHAT?" ([MASK] was fond of supplying her own surprise.) "Yes, for her husband, and it really is so."
HowardsEnd	44	45143	45122	45166	Helen	Husband? husband? Oh, and she so magnificently dressed and tinkling like a chandelier." "Now, [MASK], what did really happen?" "What I say. I was, as it were, orating my speech.
HowardsEnd	44	45167	45151	45195	Annie	"What I say. I was, as it were, orating my speech. [MASK] opens the door like a fool, and shows a female straight in on me, with my mouth open. Then we began--very civilly.
HowardsEnd	52	45675	45629	45681	Margaret	It means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere, doesn t it?" "I don t think so--she doesn t really mind. The admirable creature isn t capable of tragedy." "Her husband may be, though," said [MASK], moving to the window.
HowardsEnd	47	45781	45753	45800	Tibby	She feared, fantastically, that her own little flock might be moving into turmoil and squalor, into nearer contact with such episodes as these. "[MASK] and I have again been wondering where we ll live next September," she said at last.
HowardsEnd	57	46108	46091	46148	Margaret	Hints of robustness survived in him, more than a hint of primitive good looks, and [MASK], noting the spine that might have been straight, and the chest that might have broadened, wondered whether it paid to give up the glory of the animal for a tail coat and a couple of ideas.
HowardsEnd	54	46149	46149	46203	Culture	[MASK] had worked in her own case, but during the last few weeks she had doubted whether it humanised the majority, so wide and so widening is the gulf that stretches between the natural and the philosophic man, so many the good chaps who are wrecked in trying to cross it.
HowardsEnd	49	46376	46354	46403	Helen	"We hear the Fifth practically every time it s done, so I m not sure--do you remember, [MASK]?" "Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade?" He thought not. "Then I don t remember.
HowardsEnd	50	46486	46472	46522	Margaret	"The mistake arose out of my card, did it?" interposed [MASK]. "Yes, the mistake arose--it was a mistake." "The lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too, and that she could find you?"
HowardsEnd	55	46705	46695	46750	Helen	He explained again, but was obviously lying, and [MASK] didn t see why he should get off. She had the cruelty of youth. Neglecting her sister s pressure, she said, "I still don t understand. When did you say you paid this call?" "Call?
HowardsEnd	56	46800	46751	46807	Tibby	What call?" said he, staring as if her question had been a foolish one, a favourite device of those in mid-stream. "This afternoon call." "In the afternoon, of course!" he replied, and looked at [MASK] to see how the repartee went.
HowardsEnd	50	46907	46882	46932	Margaret	"I know what you mean, and it isn t so." "Oh, don t let us mind," said [MASK], distressed again by odours from the abyss. "It was something else," he asserted, his elaborate manner breaking down.
HowardsEnd	51	47092	47042	47093	Leonard	"That s another beautiful book. You get back to the earth in that. I wanted--" He mouthed affectedly. Then through the mists of his culture came a hard fact, hard as a pebble. "I walked all the Saturday night," said [MASK].
HowardsEnd	54	47129	47128	47182	Helen	Said [MASK], "No doubt it s another beautiful book, but I d rather hear about your road." "Oh, I walked." "How far?" "I don t know, nor for how long. It got too dark to see my watch."
HowardsEnd	51	47276	47231	47282	Helen	The fellows there said one steers by the Pole Star, and I looked it up in the celestial atlas, but once out of doors everything gets so mixed." "Don t talk to me about the Pole Star," interrupted [MASK], who was becoming interested.
HowardsEnd	51	47331	47312	47363	Tibby	First of all the street lamps, then the trees, and towards morning it got cloudy." [MASK], who preferred his comedy undiluted, slipped from the room. He knew that this fellow would never attain to poetry, and did not want to hear him trying.
HowardsEnd	50	47519	47500	47550	Helen	I did get into woods, too, presently." "Yes, go on," said [MASK]. "You ve no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it s dark." "Did you actually go off the roads?" "Oh yes.
HowardsEnd	50	47637	47604	47654	Helen	It s a wonder your walk didn t end in a broken neck. Whatever did your wife say?" "Professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses," said [MASK]. "Besides, they can t walk. It tires them. Go on."
HowardsEnd	48	48305	48304	48352	Leonard	And [MASK] had reached the destination. He had visited the county of Surrey when darkness covered its amenities, and its cosy villas had re-entered ancient night. Every twelve hours this miracle happens, but he had troubled to go and see for himself.
HowardsEnd	47	48482	48456	48503	Helen	Now, my wife would never understand--not if I explained for days." "No, it wasn t foolish!" cried [MASK], her eyes aflame. "You ve pushed back the boundaries; I think it splendid of you."
HowardsEnd	55	48594	48540	48595	Margaret	The hansom had come to take them to their evening party. "Oh, bother, not to say dash--I had forgotten we were dining out; but do, do, come round again and have a talk." "Yes, you must--do," echoed [MASK].
HowardsEnd	49	48624	48611	48660	Margaret	It s better like this." "Why better?" asked [MASK]. "No, it is better not to risk a second interview. I shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life. Really.
HowardsEnd	50	48713	48707	48757	Helen	"I know," flashed [MASK], "but people don t." He could not understand this. He continued in a vein which mingled true imagination and false. What he said wasn t wrong, but it wasn t right, and a false note jarred.
HowardsEnd	47	48950	48936	48983	Leonard	She had never known the clear-cut armies of the purer air. [MASK] hurried through her tinted wonders, very much part of the picture. His was a grey life, and to brighten it he had ruled off a few corners for romance.
HowardsEnd	49	49262	49229	49278	Margaret	But they to him were denizens of Romance, who must keep to the corner he had assigned them, pictures that must not walk out of their frames. His behaviour over [MASK] s visiting-card had been typical. His had scarcely been a tragic marriage.
HowardsEnd	44	49326	49295	49339	Leonard	He could not leave his wife, and he did not want to hit her. Petulance and squalor were enough. Here "that card" had come in. [MASK], though furtive, was untidy, and left it lying about.
HowardsEnd	53	49444	49422	49475	Leonard	It was submitted to third parties. A few inches of pasteboard, it became the battlefield on which the souls of [MASK] and his wife contended. Why did he not say, "A lady took my umbrella, another gave me this that I might call for my umbrella"?
HowardsEnd	41	49477	49450	49491	Jacky	Why did he not say, "A lady took my umbrella, another gave me this that I might call for my umbrella"? Because [MASK] would have disbelieved him? Partly, but chiefly because he was sentimental.
HowardsEnd	52	49508	49483	49535	Jacky	Partly, but chiefly because he was sentimental. No affection gathered round the card, but it symbolised the life of culture, that [MASK] should never spoil. At night he would say to himself, "Well, at all events, she doesn t know about that card.
HowardsEnd	48	49590	49587	49635	Leonard	All the Friday [MASK] had refused to speak to her, and had spent the evening observing the stars. On the Saturday he went up, as usual, to town, but he came not back Saturday night, nor Sunday morning, nor Sunday afternoon.
HowardsEnd	55	49682	49669	49724	Ruskin	The card, the fatal card, was gone from the pages of [MASK], and he guessed what had happened. "Well?" he had exclaimed, greeting her with peals of laughter. "I know where you ve been, but you don t know where I ve been."
HowardsEnd	57	49753	49745	49802	Leonard	Explanations were difficult at this stage, and [MASK] was too silly--or it is tempting to write, too sound a chap to attempt them. His reticence was not entirely the shoddy article that a business life promotes, the reticence that pretends that nothing is something, and hides behind the Daily Telegraph.
HowardsEnd	50	50818	50769	50819	Margaret	I cannot have you speaking out of your role. It makes my poor head go round, and I think you forget that I am very ill." "Your head won t go round if only you ll listen to my argument," said [MASK].
HowardsEnd	50	50992	50948	50998	Margaret	It is these little driblets, distributed among too many, that do the harm. Money s educational. It s far more educational than the things it buys." There was a protest. "In a sense," added [MASK], but the protest continued.
HowardsEnd	51	52078	52068	52119	Helen	"Then did the card see the wife--" "[MASK], come to bed." "No, just a little longer, it is so beautiful. Tell me; oh yes; did you say money is the warp of the world?" "Yes."
HowardsEnd	48	52137	52116	52164	Margaret	"Yes." "Then what s the woof?" "Very much what one chooses," said [MASK]. "It s something that isn t money--one can t say more." "Walking at night?" "Probably."
HowardsEnd	49	52857	52836	52885	Evie	"Sounds a most original entertainment!" he exclaimed, and laughed in his pleasant way. "I wish [MASK] would go to that sort of thing. But she hasn t the time. She s taken to breeding Aberdeen terriers--jolly little dogs."
HowardsEnd	54	53084	53046	53100	Margaret	Time after time I ve missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and I haven t. Oh, I believe in these discussions." The patronising tone, thought [MASK], came well enough from a man who was old enough to be their father.
HowardsEnd	50	53149	53112	53162	Helen	In times of sorrow or emotion his inadequacy had pained her, but it was pleasant to listen to him now, and to watch his thick brown moustache and high forehead confronting the stars. But [MASK] was nettled. The aim of their debates she implied was Truth.
HowardsEnd	47	53181	53153	53200	Margaret	The aim of their debates she implied was Truth. "Oh yes, it doesn t much matter what subject you take," said he. [MASK] laughed and said, "But this is going to be far better than the debate itself."
HowardsEnd	50	53311	53270	53320	Margaret	We ve just come across a young fellow, who s evidently very poor, and who seems interest--" "What s his profession?" "Clerk." "What in?" "Do you remember, [MASK]?" "Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company."
HowardsEnd	47	53492	53457	53504	Margaret	Suppose a millionaire died, and desired to leave money to help such a man. How should he be helped? Should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct, which was [MASK] s plan? Most of them thought this would pauperise him.
HowardsEnd	47	53682	53636	53683	Margaret	I will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested. My only contribution is this: let your young friend clear out of the Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company with all possible speed." "Why?" said [MASK].
HowardsEnd	50	53783	53741	53791	Olympian	"WILL have? Let him leave the ship before it sinks. Let him get one now." "Rather than wait, to make sure?" "Decidedly." "Why s that?" Again the [MASK] laugh, and the lowered voice. "
HowardsEnd	50	53913	53907	53957	Margaret	"Not well," confessed [MASK]. "There you are!" "Then do you really advise us to tell this youth--?" "I advise nothing," he interrupted, glancing up and down the Embankment, in case his indiscretion had been overheard.
HowardsEnd	50	54036	53989	54039	Helen	Now, don t say I said so. It s outside the Tariff Ring." "Certainly I won t say. In fact, I don t know what that means." "I thought an insurance company never smashed," was [MASK] s contribution.
HowardsEnd	41	54296	54260	54301	Evie	How strange are the ways of Fate!" "No; it s let unfurnished. We ve moved." "Why, I thought of you both as anchored there for ever. [MASK] never told me."
HowardsEnd	51	54323	54316	54367	Paul	We only moved a week ago. [MASK] has rather a feeling for the old place, and we held on for him to have his holiday there; but, really, it is impossibly small. Endless drawbacks. I forget whether you ve been up to it?"
HowardsEnd	49	54432	54390	54439	Evie	They don t really do, spend what you will on them. We messed away with a garage all among the wych-elm roots, and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a rockery. [MASK] got rather keen on Alpine plants.
HowardsEnd	49	54811	54767	54816	Margaret	He had a motor, too. There they all are, a very jolly party--he and she and the two grandchildren." "I manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them themselves," said [MASK] as they shook hands.
HowardsEnd	45	55028	55002	55047	Margaret	We shan t be there very long, either." "You, too, on the move?" "Next September," [MASK] sighed. "Every one moving! Good-bye." The tide had begun to ebb.
HowardsEnd	49	55267	55222	55271	Leonard	I m afraid you thought my letter rather odd, but we ll explain--we aren t odd, really--nor affected, really. We re over-expressive--that s all." As a lady s lap-dog [MASK] did not excel.
HowardsEnd	54	55313	55298	55352	Helen	His wit was the Cockney s; it opened no doors into imagination, and [MASK] was drawn up short by "The more a lady has to say, the better," administered waggishly. "Oh yes," she said. "Ladies brighten--" "Yes, I know.
HowardsEnd	43	55377	55335	55378	Margaret	"Oh yes," she said. "Ladies brighten--" "Yes, I know. The darlings are regular sunbeams. Let me give you a plate." "How do you like your work?" interposed [MASK].
HowardsEnd	44	55738	55712	55756	Leonard	"I quite agree, and that s why I was curious to know; is it a solid, well-established concern?" [MASK] had no idea. He understood his own corner of the machine, but nothing beyond it.
HowardsEnd	56	55850	55831	55887	Leonard	A large sum of money was inscribed below, and you drew your own conclusions. This giant caused [MASK] to do arithmetic and write letters, to explain the regulations to new clients, and re-explain them to old ones. A giant was of an impulsive morality--one knew that much.
HowardsEnd	45	55946	55914	55959	Zeus	But his true fighting weight, his antecedents, his amours with other members of the commercial Pantheon--all these were as uncertain to ordinary mortals as were the escapades of [MASK]. While the gods are powerful, we learn little about them.
HowardsEnd	50	56156	56120	56170	Leonard	"I mean I wouldn t say he s right altogether." But this was a blunder. "Then he is right partly," said the elder woman, quick as lightning. [MASK] replied that every one was right partly, if it came to that.
HowardsEnd	49	56243	56211	56260	Helen	"Our friend, who is also a business man, was so positive. He said before Christmas--" "And advised you to clear out of it," concluded [MASK]. "But I don t see why he should know better than you do."
HowardsEnd	45	56261	56245	56290	Leonard	"But I don t see why he should know better than you do." [MASK] rubbed his hands. He was tempted to say that he knew nothing about the thing at all. But a commercial training was too strong for him.
HowardsEnd	47	56462	56421	56468	Leonard	He was itching to talk about books and make the most of his romantic hour. Minute after minute slipped away, while the ladies, with imperfect skill, discussed the subject of reinsurance or praised their anonymous friend. [MASK] grew annoyed--perhaps rightly.
HowardsEnd	43	56626	56608	56651	Jacky	How can we do justice to the pattern otherwise? And the precious minutes slipped away, and [MASK] and squalor came nearer. At last he could bear it no longer, and broke in, reciting the names of books feverishly.
HowardsEnd	51	56856	56855	56906	Leonard	Then [MASK] s gorge arose. Why should he come again? What was the good of it? He said roundly: "No, I shan t; I knew it would be a failure." Most people would have let him go. "A little mistake.
HowardsEnd	50	56937	56925	56975	Helen	They had attempted friendship, and they would take the consequences. [MASK] retorted, "I call that a very rude remark. What do you want to turn on me like that for?" and suddenly the drawing-room re-echoed to a vulgar row.
HowardsEnd	50	57014	56987	57037	Helen	"Yes." "What do you want to have me here for?" "To help you, you silly boy!" cried [MASK]. "And don t shout." "I don t want your patronage. I don t want your tea.
HowardsEnd	50	57122	57108	57158	Margaret	Can we be of any use, or shall we go?" But [MASK] ignored him. "I m connected with a leading insurance company, sir. I receive what I take to be an invitation from these--ladies" (he drawled the word).
HowardsEnd	47	57246	57231	57278	Jacky	" His voice rose; he was falling into the rhythm of a scene with [MASK]. "But as soon as I m useful it s a very different thing. Oh yes, send for him. Cross-question him. Pick his brains.
HowardsEnd	51	57401	57356	57407	Leonard	Laughter. "You tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all--away past books and houses to the truth. You were looking for a real home." "I fail to see the connection," said [MASK], hot with stupid anger.
HowardsEnd	53	57593	57550	57603	Leonard	I struggle by remembering my friends; others I have known by remembering some place--some beloved place or tree--we thought you one of these." "Of course, if there s been any misunderstanding," mumbled [MASK], "all I can do is to go.
HowardsEnd	48	57700	57700	57748	Helen	[MASK] hesitated. "But really--" said their visitor. "Ought she to?" At once she went. He resumed. "I would have chimed in, but I felt that you could polish him off for yourselves--I didn t interfere.
HowardsEnd	51	57836	57806	57857	Margaret	"Yes, indeed," chuckled her father; "all that part about mechanical cheerfulness --oh, fine!" "I m very sorry," said [MASK], collecting herself. "He s a nice creature really. I cannot think what set him off.
HowardsEnd	42	57995	57976	58018	Margaret	"I hardly consider that a fair deduction," he said. "Obviously unfair," said [MASK]. "I was only thinking how tangled things are. It s our fault mostly--neither yours nor his."
HowardsEnd	56	58045	58038	58094	Evie	"Yes, indeed," nodded [MASK], a little contemptuously. "You behave much too well to people, and then they impose on you. I know the world and that type of man, and as soon as I entered the room I saw you had not been treating him properly.
HowardsEnd	54	58160	58128	58182	Margaret	"Ye--es." "Do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman." "I admit it willingly," said [MASK], who was pacing up and down the room. "A gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself."
HowardsEnd	49	58862	58816	58865	Evie	"His wife is an old bore," she said simply. "He never came home last Saturday night because he wanted to be alone, and she thought he was with us." "With YOU?" "Yes." [MASK] tittered. "
HowardsEnd	53	59020	59005	59058	Margaret	With most ladies he would not have discussed it, but he was trading on [MASK] s reputation as an emancipated woman. "He said so, and about such a thing he wouldn t lie." They both began to laugh. "That s where I differ from you.
HowardsEnd	46	59493	59463	59509	Margaret	she called. "Yes!" replied a voice from the library. "You in there?" "Yes--he s gone some time." [MASK] went to her. "Why, you re all alone," she said.
HowardsEnd	48	59636	59628	59676	Helen	Make light of the whole thing." [MASK] came and behaved with a cheerfulness that reassured their visitor--this hen at all events was fancy-free. "He s gone with my blessing," she cried, "and now for puppies."
HowardsEnd	51	59809	59797	59848	Evie	And I shouldn t have called either of them girls." [MASK] had grown up handsome. Dark-eyed, with the glow of youth under sunburn, built firmly and firm-lipped, she was the best the Wilcoxes could do in the way of feminine beauty.
HowardsEnd	48	59928	59903	59951	Margaret	CHAPTER XVII The Age of Property holds bitter moments even for a proprietor. When a move is imminent, furniture becomes ridiculous, and [MASK] now lay awake at nights wondering where, where on earth they and all their belongings would be deposited in September next.
HowardsEnd	53	60841	60805	60858	Evie	" With a smile of pleasure she moved forward to greet him, and her feeling of loneliness vanished. "I thought I d get round if I could," said he. "[MASK] told me of her little plan, so I just slipped in and secured a table.
HowardsEnd	51	60920	60903	60954	Margaret	Been worrying round after your young clerks?" "No, after houses," said [MASK], edging past him into the box. "I m hungry, not tired; I want to eat heaps." "That s good. What ll you have?"
HowardsEnd	50	60980	60944	60994	Simpson	"That s good. What ll you have?" "Fish pie," said she, with a glance at the menu. "Fish pie! Fancy coming for fish pie to [MASK] s. It s not a bit the thing to go for here."
HowardsEnd	43	61086	61047	61090	Margaret	That s the type of thing. I like this place, for a joke, once in a way. It is so thoroughly Old English. Don t you agree?" "Yes," said [MASK], who didn t.
HowardsEnd	45	61144	61142	61187	Evie	He and [MASK] soon fell into a conversation of the "No, I didn t; yes, you did" type--conversation which, though fascinating to those who are engaged in it, neither desires nor deserves the attention of others.
HowardsEnd	49	61395	61351	61400	Evie	"Afraid I don t." "Well, what s the point of being practical if you can t find two distressed females a house? We merely want a small house with large rooms, and plenty of them." "[MASK], I like that!
HowardsEnd	50	61817	61799	61849	Helen	He had heard of astral planes, and censured them. "Just so. Luckily it was [MASK] s aura, not mine, and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses. I just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went."
HowardsEnd	53	61973	61961	62014	Theosophy	Because, though I don t believe in auras, and think [MASK] s only a halfway-house--" "--Yet there may be something in it all the same," he concluded, with a frown. "Not even that. It may be halfway in the wrong direction.
HowardsEnd	50	62083	62045	62095	Margaret	He seemed unsatisfied, and said: "So you wouldn t give me your word that you DON T hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it?" "I could," said [MASK], surprised that the point was of any importance to him.
HowardsEnd	53	62166	62145	62198	Margaret	"Yes, I am," "No, you re not," burst from the lovers opposite. [MASK] was silent for a moment, and then changed the subject. "How s your house?" "Much the same as when you honoured it last week."
HowardsEnd	48	62596	62596	62644	Margaret	[MASK] could not reply. Was he incredibly stupid, or did he understand her better than she understood herself? "You do admit that, if wealth was divided up equally, in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same.
HowardsEnd	59	63093	63063	63122	Margaret	It was a businesslike letter, and stated frankly what he would do for them and what he would not do. Also the rent. If they approved, [MASK] was to come up AT ONCE--the words were underlined, as is necessary when dealing with women--and to go over the house with him.
HowardsEnd	53	63590	63557	63610	Meg	It is now over three years, and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time." "Interesting people don t get one houses." "[MASK], if you start in your honest-English vein, I shall throw the treacle at you."
HowardsEnd	49	63623	63611	63660	Margaret	"It s a better vein than the cosmopolitan," said [MASK], getting up. "Now, children, which is it to be? You know the Ducie Street house. Shall I say yes or shall I say no? Tibby love--which?
HowardsEnd	49	63704	63698	63747	Margaret	"Say no. " Then [MASK] spoke rather seriously. "I think," she said, "that our race is degenerating. We cannot settle even this little thing; what will it be like when we have to settle a big one?"
HowardsEnd	51	63759	63709	63760	Helen	"I think," she said, "that our race is degenerating. We cannot settle even this little thing; what will it be like when we have to settle a big one?" "It will be as easy as eating," returned [MASK].
HowardsEnd	47	63947	63919	63966	Bungle	"I told you so. It is the little things one bungles at. The big, real ones are nothing when they come." "[MASK], my dear! You are too little to recollect--in fact, you weren t there.
HowardsEnd	48	64142	64142	64190	Margaret	[MASK] did that. An interrupted holiday is the worst of the minor worries, and one may be pardoned for feeling morbid when a business letter snatches one away from the sea and friends. She could not believe that her father had ever felt the same.
HowardsEnd	50	64321	64292	64342	Margaret	She had once visited a spinster--poor, silly, and unattractive--whose mania it was that every man who approached her fell in love. How [MASK] s heart had bled for the deluded thing! How she had lectured, reasoned, and in despair acquiesced!
HowardsEnd	53	64716	64665	64718	Margaret	I ve got my work all day--indeed, a great deal too much of it--but when I come home in the evening, I tell you, I can t stand the house." "In my absurd way, I m lonely too," [MASK] replied.
HowardsEnd	50	64813	64813	64863	Helen	[MASK] says it alone endures while men and houses perish, and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas--just imagine it!--rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them." "Your sister always likes her little joke."
HowardsEnd	45	65112	65092	65137	Helen	His complexion was robust, his hair had receded but not thinned, the thick moustache and the eyes that [MASK] had compared to brandy-balls had an agreeable menace in them, whether they were turned towards the slums or towards the stars.
HowardsEnd	51	65331	65318	65369	Margaret	Can you?" "Comforts are of two kinds," said [MASK], who was keeping herself in hand--"those we can share with others, like fire, weather, or music; and those we can t--food, food, for instance. It depends."
HowardsEnd	52	65397	65366	65418	Margaret	It depends." "I mean reasonable comforts, of course. I shouldn t like to think that you--" He bent nearer; the sentence died unfinished. [MASK] s head turned very stupid, and the inside of it seemed to revolve like the beacon in a lighthouse.
HowardsEnd	41	65714	65708	65749	Margaret	The room suggested men, and [MASK], keen to derive the modern capitalist from the warriors and hunters of the past, saw it as an ancient guest-hall, where the lord sat at meat among his thanes.
HowardsEnd	48	65758	65750	65798	Charles	Even the Bible--the Dutch Bible that [MASK] had brought back from the Boer War--fell into position. Such a room admitted loot. "Now the entrance-hall." The entrance-hall was paved. "Here we fellows smoke."
HowardsEnd	50	65826	65819	65869	Margaret	"Oh, jolly!" said [MASK], sinking into one of them. "You do like it?" he said, fixing his eyes on her upturned face, and surely betraying an almost intimate note. "It s all rubbish not making oneself comfortable.
HowardsEnd	42	66000	65992	66034	Chelsea	They proceeded to the drawing-room. [MASK] managed better here. It was sallow and ineffective. One could visualise the ladies withdrawing to it, while their lords discussed life s realities below, to the accompaniment of cigars.
HowardsEnd	49	66212	66206	66255	Margaret	Indeed, yes!" said [MASK]. "I am asking you to be my wife." So deep already was her sympathy, that when he said, "I am asking you to be my wife," she made herself give a little start.
HowardsEnd	48	66305	66265	66313	Margaret	An immense joy came over her. It was indescribable. It had nothing to do with humanity, and most resembled the all-pervading happiness of fine weather. Fine weather is due to the sun, but [MASK] could think of no central radiance here.
HowardsEnd	51	66856	66806	66857	Helen	She would come to no decision yet. "Oh, sir, this is so sudden"--that prudish phrase exactly expressed her when her time came. Premonitions are not preparation. She must examine more closely her own nature and his; she must talk it over judicially with [MASK].
HowardsEnd	52	67623	67585	67637	Munt	Salt water ought to have tides, and go up and down a great deal, or else it smells. Look, for instance, at an aquarium." "An aquarium! Oh, MEESIS [MASK], you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than salt?
HowardsEnd	48	67894	67890	67938	Margaret	"Oh, dearest [MASK], I do hope she won t be overtired." "Oh, I do wonder--I do wonder whether she s taken the house." "I hope she hasn t been hasty." "So do I--
HowardsEnd	41	68191	68187	68228	Frieda	Shall we?" [MASK] assented, and in a few minutes they had crossed the ridge and exchanged the greater view for the lesser. Rather a dull valley lay below, backed by the slope of the coastward downs.
HowardsEnd	53	68623	68586	68639	Helen	If I m certain of anything it s of that." "One is certain of nothing but the truth of one s own emotions." The remark fell damply on the conversation. But [MASK] slipped her arm round her cousin, somehow liking her the better for making it.
HowardsEnd	44	68649	68640	68684	Frieda	It was not an original remark, nor had [MASK] appropriated it passionately, for she had a patriotic rather than a philosophic mind. Yet it betrayed that interest in the universal which the average Teuton possesses and the average Englishman does not.
HowardsEnd	46	68862	68844	68890	Helen	"Have you got the house?" they shouted, long before she could possibly hear. [MASK] ran down to meet her. The highroad passed over a saddle, and a track went thence at right angles alone the ridge of the down.
HowardsEnd	48	68899	68869	68917	Margaret	The highroad passed over a saddle, and a track went thence at right angles alone the ridge of the down. "Have you got the house?" [MASK] shook her head. "Oh, what a nuisance! So we re as we were?
HowardsEnd	43	68937	68904	68947	Tibby	"Oh, what a nuisance! So we re as we were?" "Not exactly." She got out, looking tired. "Some mystery," said [MASK]. "We are to be enlightened presently."
HowardsEnd	53	68968	68968	69021	Helen	[MASK] was amused. She opened the gate on to the downs so that her brother might lead the pony through. "It s just like a widower," she remarked. "They ve cheek enough for anything, and invariably select one of their first wife s friends."
HowardsEnd	49	69022	68990	69039	Margaret	"It s just like a widower," she remarked. "They ve cheek enough for anything, and invariably select one of their first wife s friends." [MASK] s face flashed despair. "That type--" She broke off with a cry. "
HowardsEnd	51	69195	69186	69237	Margaret	She seemed incapable of saying any other word. [MASK], trembling herself, led her forward up the road, till they strayed through another gate on to the down. "Don t, don t do such a thing! I tell you not to--don t!
HowardsEnd	47	69259	69218	69265	Helen	"Don t, don t do such a thing! I tell you not to--don t! I know--don t!" "What do you know?" "Panic and emptiness," sobbed [MASK]. "Don t!"
HowardsEnd	49	69323	69294	69343	Helen	She said: "But we would still see each other very--often, and you--" "It s not a thing like that," sobbed [MASK]. And she broke right away and wandered distractedly upwards, stretching her hands towards the view and crying.
HowardsEnd	51	69353	69325	69376	Margaret	And she broke right away and wandered distractedly upwards, stretching her hands towards the view and crying. "What s happened to you?" called [MASK], following through the wind that gathers at sundown on the northern slopes of hills. "But it s stupid!"
HowardsEnd	51	69426	69416	69467	Helen	"We must both have gone mad." Then [MASK] wiped hers, and they even laughed a little. "Look here, sit down." "All right; I ll sit down if you ll sit down." "There. (One kiss.)
HowardsEnd	41	69538	69538	69579	Helen	[MASK] was silent. "Well?" "Tell me about it first, and meanwhile perhaps I ll have got my head out of the slime." "That s better. Well, where shall I begin?
HowardsEnd	50	69758	69758	69808	Margaret	[MASK] considered. "It is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you," she said. "The mere fact of that grows more tremendous. Remember, I ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years." "But loved him?"
HowardsEnd	53	69809	69761	69814	Margaret	"It is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you," she said. "The mere fact of that grows more tremendous. Remember, I ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years." "But loved him?" [MASK] peered into her past.
HowardsEnd	45	69839	69835	69880	Helen	With her arm round [MASK], and her eyes shifting over the view, as if this country or that could reveal the secret of her own heart, she meditated honestly, and said, "No." "But you will?"
HowardsEnd	49	69886	69881	69930	Margaret	"Yes," said [MASK], "of that I m pretty sure. Indeed, I began the moment he spoke to me." "And have settled to marry him?" "I had, but am wanting a long talk about it now.
HowardsEnd	49	69937	69896	69945	Helen	Indeed, I began the moment he spoke to me." "And have settled to marry him?" "I had, but am wanting a long talk about it now. What is it against him, [MASK]? You must try and say."
HowardsEnd	50	70227	70178	70228	Helen	His sympathy lacks poetry, and so isn t sympathy really. I d even say"--she looked at the shining lagoons--"that, spiritually, he s not as honest as I am. Doesn t that satisfy you?" "No, it doesn t," said [MASK].
HowardsEnd	50	70244	70244	70294	Margaret	[MASK] made a movement of irritation. "I don t intend him, or any man or any woman, to be all my life--good heavens, no! There are heaps of things in me that he doesn t, and shall never, understand."
HowardsEnd	54	70569	70517	70571	Paul	Without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm. More and more do I refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it. There are times when it seems to me--" "And to me, and to all women. So one kissed [MASK]."
HowardsEnd	43	70579	70572	70615	Margaret	"That s brutal," said [MASK]. "Mine is an absolutely different case. I ve thought things out." "It makes no difference thinking things out. They come to the same." "Rubbish!"
HowardsEnd	54	70871	70869	70923	Love	Whom does [MASK] concern beyond the beloved and the lover? Yet his impact deluges a hundred shores. No doubt the disturbance is really the spirit of the generations, welcoming the new generation, and chafing against the ultimate Fate, who holds all the seas in the palm of her hand.
HowardsEnd	50	70925	70880	70930	Love	Yet his impact deluges a hundred shores. No doubt the disturbance is really the spirit of the generations, welcoming the new generation, and chafing against the ultimate Fate, who holds all the seas in the palm of her hand. But [MASK] cannot understand this.
HowardsEnd	55	70985	70969	71024	Fate	He knows that he will survive at the end of things, and be gathered by [MASK] as a jewel from the slime, and be handed with admiration round the assembly of the gods. "Men did produce this" they will say, and, saying, they will give men immortality.
HowardsEnd	47	71061	71025	71072	Theology	But meanwhile--what agitations meanwhile! The foundations of Property and Propriety are laid bare, twin rocks; Family Pride flounders to the surface, puffing and blowing and refusing to be comforted; [MASK], vaguely ascetic, gets up a nasty ground swell.
HowardsEnd	45	71141	71141	71186	Margaret	[MASK] had expected the disturbance, and was not irritated by it. For a sensitive woman she had steady nerves, and could bear with the incongruous and the grotesque; and, besides, there was nothing excessive about her love-affair.
HowardsEnd	53	71212	71212	71265	Henry	[MASK] did not encourage romance, and she was no girl to fidget for it. An acquaintance had become a lover, might become a husband, but would retain all that she had noted in the acquaintance; and love must confirm an old relation rather than reveal a new one.
HowardsEnd	48	71334	71330	71378	Margaret	After dinner he asked [MASK] if she wouldn t care for a turn on the Parade. She accepted, and could not repress a little tremor; it would be her first real love scene. But as she put on her hat she burst out laughing.
HowardsEnd	50	71528	71483	71533	Henry	Did you?" "I don t know about that; I shouldn t like to say." "Why, was it earlier?" she cried. "Did you think of me this way earlier! How extraordinarily interesting, [MASK]! Tell me."
HowardsEnd	52	71535	71530	71582	Henry	Tell me." But [MASK] had no intention of telling. Perhaps he could not have told, for his mental states became obscure as soon as he had passed through them. He misliked the very word "interesting," connoting it with wasted energy and even with morbidity.
HowardsEnd	54	71754	71702	71756	Tibby	"I was thinking, if you didn t mind, that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk; there will be so much to settle." "I think so too. Tell me, in the first place, how did you get on with [MASK]?"
HowardsEnd	44	71997	71958	72002	Helen	"I wasn t aware, and, if I can manage it, you will never do such a thing again." She said more gravely: "You haven t found time for a talk with [MASK] yet, I suppose?
HowardsEnd	45	72121	72077	72122	Charles	"Exactly. The girl s madly in love with him. A very good sort of fellow, but he demands--and rightly--a suitable provision with her. And in the second place you will naturally understand, there is [MASK].
HowardsEnd	50	72323	72286	72336	Charles	I am determined that my children shall have me." "Be generous to them," she said sharply. "Bother justice!" "I am determined--and have already written to [MASK] to that effect--" "But how much have you got?"
HowardsEnd	53	72381	72329	72382	Charles	But how much have you got?" "What?" "How much have you a year? I ve six hundred." "My income?" "Yes. We must begin with how much you have, before we can settle how much you can give [MASK].
HowardsEnd	52	72574	72564	72616	Margaret	"Yes, we ve settled that," said [MASK], undisturbed by his strategic blunderings. "Go ahead; give away all you can, bearing in mind that I ve a clear six hundred. What a mercy it is to have all this money about one."
HowardsEnd	46	72637	72603	72649	Helen	What a mercy it is to have all this money about one." "We ve none too much, I assure you; you re marrying a poor man." "[MASK] wouldn t agree with me here," she continued. "
HowardsEnd	47	72650	72649	72696	Helen	"[MASK] daren t slang the rich, being rich herself, but she would like to. There s an odd notion, that I haven t yet got hold of, running about at the back of her brain, that poverty is somehow real.
HowardsEnd	52	72724	72712	72764	Helen	Sovereigns in a stocking wouldn t bother her; cheques do. [MASK] is too relentless. One can t deal in her high-handed manner with the world." "There s this other point, and then I must go back to my hotel and write some letters.
HowardsEnd	51	72910	72866	72917	Evie	" They moved away quietly enough, but were only biding their time, and the rest of the conversation was punctuated by peals of ungovernable laughter. Lowering his voice and infusing a hint of reproof into it, he said: "[MASK] will probably be married in September.
HowardsEnd	49	73365	73328	73377	Ducie	"Yes, in summer especially, the mews is a serious nuisance. The smoking-room, too, is an abominable little den. The house opposite has been taken by operatic people. [MASK] Street s going down, it s my private opinion."
HowardsEnd	55	73716	73666	73721	Margaret	"It isn t meant as a compliment, my dear. I just won t have you going about in the dark. Such people about too! It s dangerous." "Can t I look after myself? I do wish--" "Come along, [MASK]; no wheedling."
HowardsEnd	58	73733	73722	73780	Margaret	A younger woman might have resented his masterly ways, but [MASK] had too firm a grip of life to make a fuss. She was, in her own way, as masterly. If he was a fortress she was a mountain peak, whom all might tread, but whom the snows made nightly virginal.
HowardsEnd	51	74098	74096	74147	Charles	CHAPTER XXI [MASK] had just been scolding his Dolly. She deserved the scolding, and had bent before it, but her head, though bloody was unsubdued and her chirrupings began to mingle with his retreating thunder. "You ve waked the baby. I knew you would.
HowardsEnd	48	74214	74192	74240	Charles	Who asked my sister down to meet him? Who sent them out in the motor day after day?" "[MASK], that reminds me of some poem." "Does it indeed? We shall all be dancing to a very different music presently.
HowardsEnd	51	74440	74407	74458	diddums	"I call the way you twist things round and make them hang together most unfair. You couldn t have been nastier if you d caught me flirting. Could he, [MASK]?" "We re in a bad hole, and must make the best of it.
HowardsEnd	47	74486	74443	74490	Schlegels	"We re in a bad hole, and must make the best of it. I shall answer the pater s letter civilly. He s evidently anxious to do the decent thing. But I do not intend to forget these [MASK] in a hurry.
HowardsEnd	43	74655	74653	74696	Margaret	CHAPTER XXII [MASK] greeted her lord with peculiar tenderness on the morrow. Mature as he was, she might yet be able to help him to the building of the rainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us with the passion.
HowardsEnd	56	74743	74720	74776	Happy	With it love is born, and alights on the highest curve, glowing against the grey, sober against the fire. [MASK] the man who sees from either aspect the glory of these outspread wings. The roads of his soul lie clear, and he and his friends shall find easy-going.
HowardsEnd	51	74961	74956	75007	Margaret	And it was here that [MASK] hoped to help him. It did not seem so difficult. She need trouble him with no gift of her own. She would only point out the salvation that was latent in his own soul, and in the soul of every man.
HowardsEnd	56	75117	75079	75135	Henry	It need not take the form of a good "talking." By quiet indications the bridge would be built and span their lives with beauty. But she failed. For there was one quality in [MASK] for which she was never prepared, however much she reminded herself of it: his obtuseness.
HowardsEnd	50	75327	75290	75340	Helen	And this morning he concentrated with a vengeance. They met in the rhododendrons of yesterday. In the daylight the bushes were inconsiderable and the path was bright in the morning sun. She was with [MASK], who had been ominously quiet since the affair was settled. "
HowardsEnd	50	75390	75389	75439	Henry	"[MASK], she has had such a nice letter from the queer, cross boy. Do you remember him? He had a sad moustache, but the back of his head was young." "I have had a letter too. Not a nice one--
HowardsEnd	59	75586	75586	75645	Bryce	[MASK] has been ordered abroad, and wants to sublet it--I am far from sure that I shall give him permission. There was no clause in the agreement. In my opinion, subletting is a mistake. If he can find me another tenant, whom I consider suitable, I may cancel the agreement.
HowardsEnd	50	75648	75610	75660	Schlegel	There was no clause in the agreement. In my opinion, subletting is a mistake. If he can find me another tenant, whom I consider suitable, I may cancel the agreement. Morning, [MASK]. Don t you think that s better than subletting?"
HowardsEnd	47	76033	76005	76052	Margaret	Things may be done for which no money can compensate. For instance, I shouldn t want that fine wych-elm spoilt. It hangs--[MASK], we must go and see the old place some time. It s pretty in its way.
HowardsEnd	48	76124	76107	76155	Margaret	"But you can give that up now." "Er--no," said [MASK], after a moment s thought. "Oh, that ll be all right. I ll speak to her." "This visit is a high solemnity.
HowardsEnd	50	76183	76165	76215	Frieda	She turns the house upside down for us; she invites our special friends--she scarcely knows [MASK], and we can t leave her on her hands. I missed one day, and she would be so hurt if I didn t stay the full ten."
HowardsEnd	50	76233	76195	76245	Henry	I missed one day, and she would be so hurt if I didn t stay the full ten." "But I ll say a word to her. Don t you bother." "[MASK], I won t go. Don t bully me."
HowardsEnd	49	76501	76470	76519	Margaret	"No, the fellow needn t." "--and needn t have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary." "He only says reduced, " corrected [MASK], seeing trouble ahead. "With a man so poor, every reduction must be great.
HowardsEnd	46	76573	76555	76601	Helen	What s that? Do you mean that I m responsible?" "You re ridiculous, [MASK]." "You seem to think--" He looked at his watch. "Let me explain the point to you. It is like this.
HowardsEnd	50	76682	76653	76703	Helen--	I am not sure that I shall succeed, but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency, and I am trying. My dear [MASK]" "Is that your point? A man who had little money has less--that s mine."
HowardsEnd	53	76835	76783	76836	Helen	No one s to blame." "Is no one to blame for anything?" "I wouldn t say that, but you re taking it far too seriously. Who is this fellow?" "We have told you about the fellow twice already," said [MASK].
HowardsEnd	49	76937	76906	76955	Margaret	"I require no more advice." "A word of advice. Don t take up that sentimental attitude over the poor. See that she doesn t, [MASK]. The poor are poor, and one s sorry for them, but there it is.
HowardsEnd	52	77040	77018	77070	Helen	It s just the shoe pinching--no one can help it; and it might easily have been worse." [MASK] quivered with indignation. "By all means subscribe to charities--subscribe to them largely--but don t get carried away by absurd schemes of Social Reform.
HowardsEnd	54	77524	77502	77556	Helen	"Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie?" "Because I m an old maid," said [MASK], biting her lip. "I can t think why I go on like this myself." She shook off her sister s hand and went into the house.
HowardsEnd	43	77557	77530	77573	Margaret	"I can t think why I go on like this myself." She shook off her sister s hand and went into the house. [MASK], distressed at the day s beginning, followed the Bournemouth steamer with her eyes.
HowardsEnd	47	77827	77805	77852	Helen	She censured her, not for disapproving of the engagement, but for throwing over her disapproval a veil of mystery. [MASK] was equally frank. "Yes," she said, with the air of one looking inwards, "there is a mystery.
HowardsEnd	49	77875	77865	77914	Helen	It s the way life has been made." [MASK] in those days was over-interested in the subconscious self. She exaggerated the Punch and Judy aspect of life, and spoke of mankind as puppets, whom an invisible showman twitches into love and war.
HowardsEnd	44	77915	77888	77932	Margaret	She exaggerated the Punch and Judy aspect of life, and spoke of mankind as puppets, whom an invisible showman twitches into love and war. [MASK] pointed out that if she dwelt on this she, too, would eliminate the personal.
HowardsEnd	45	77933	77933	77978	Helen	[MASK] was silent for a minute, and then burst into a queer speech, which cleared the air. "Go on and marry him. I think you re splendid; and if any one can pull it off, you will."
HowardsEnd	50	78159	78145	78195	Greek	"You mean to keep proportion, and that s heroic, it s [MASK], and I don t see why it shouldn t succeed with you. Go on and fight with him and help him. Don t ask me for help, or even for sympathy.
HowardsEnd	52	78235	78184	78236	Tibby	Don t ask me for help, or even for sympathy. Henceforward I m going my own way. I mean to be thorough, because thoroughness is easy. I mean to dislike your husband, and to tell him so. I mean to make no concessions to [MASK].
HowardsEnd	50	78238	78237	78287	Tibby	If [MASK] wants to live with me, he must lump me. I mean to love you more than ever. Yes, I do. You and I have built up something real, because it is purely spiritual. There s no veil of mystery over us.
HowardsEnd	51	78336	78300	78351	Margaret	The popular view is, as usual, exactly the wrong one. Our bothers are over tangible things--money, husbands, house-hunting. But Heaven will work of itself." [MASK] was grateful for this expression of affection, and answered, "Perhaps."
HowardsEnd	46	78920	78887	78933	Henry	Another map hung opposite, on which the whole continent appeared, looking like a whale marked out for a blubber, and by its side was a door, shut, but [MASK] s voice came through it, dictating a "strong" letter.
HowardsEnd	50	79145	79105	79155	Margaret	I wonder what you ll think of the place. I wouldn t touch it with tongs myself. Do sit down! It s a measly little place." "I shall enjoy seeing it," said [MASK], feeling, for the first time, shy.
HowardsEnd	48	79166	79156	79204	Bryce	"You ll see it at its worst, for [MASK] decamped abroad last Monday without even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him. I never saw such a disgraceful mess. It s unbelievable. He wasn t in the house a month."
HowardsEnd	51	79301	79291	79342	Charles	"Yes, I flung them down," said [MASK] modestly. "I ve sent a telegram after him, and a pretty sharp one, too. He, and he in person, is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next three years."
HowardsEnd	57	79365	79321	79378	Dolly	He, and he in person, is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next three years." "The keys are at the farm; we wouldn t have the keys." "Quite right." "[MASK] would have taken them, but I was in, fortunately."
HowardsEnd	50	79473	79473	79523	Charles	[MASK] saw them in, civil to the last, and in a moment the offices of the Imperial and West African Rubber Company faded away. But it was not an impressive drive. Perhaps the weather was to blame, being grey and banked high with weary clouds.
HowardsEnd	46	79705	79675	79721	Margaret	The chauffeur could not travel as quickly as he had hoped, for the Great North Road was full of Easter traffic. But he went quite quick enough for [MASK], a poor-spirited creature, who had chickens and children on the brain.
HowardsEnd	43	79910	79892	79935	Dolly	She hated war and liked soldiers--it was one of her amiable inconsistencies. But here was [MASK], dressed up to the nines, standing at the door to greet them, and here were the first drops of the rain.
HowardsEnd	47	80195	80187	80234	Henry	"What do you suppose?" said [MASK]. A little porch was close up against her face. "Are we there already?" "We are." "Well, I never! In years ago it seemed so far away."
HowardsEnd	51	80264	80225	80276	Henry	In years ago it seemed so far away." Smiling, but somehow disillusioned, she jumped out, and her impetus carried her to the front-door. She was about to open it, when [MASK] said: "That s no good; it s locked.
HowardsEnd	51	80339	80332	80383	Margaret	Then he said rather crossly: "[MASK], you wait in the dry. I ll go down for the key. It isn t a hundred yards." "Mayn t I come too?" "No; I shall be back before I m gone."
HowardsEnd	55	80421	80400	80455	Helen	For the second time that day she saw the appearance of the earth. There were the greengage-trees that [MASK] had once described, there the tennis lawn, there the hedge that would be glorious with dog-roses in June, but the vision now was of black and palest green.
HowardsEnd	54	80693	80677	80731	Margaret	The obvious dead, the intangible alive, and no connection at all between them! [MASK] smiled. Would that her own fancies were as clear-cut! Would that she could deal as high-handedly with the world! Smiling and sighing, she laid her hand upon the door.
HowardsEnd	48	80752	80720	80768	Henry	Smiling and sighing, she laid her hand upon the door. It opened. The house was not locked up at all. She hesitated. Ought she to wait for [MASK]? He felt strongly about property, and might prefer to show her over himself.
HowardsEnd	48	81261	81260	81308	Henry	"[MASK], have you got in?" But it was the heart of the house beating, faintly at first, then loudly, martially. It dominated the rain. It is the starved imagination, not the well-nourished, that is afraid.
HowardsEnd	48	81309	81269	81317	Margaret	But it was the heart of the house beating, faintly at first, then loudly, martially. It dominated the rain. It is the starved imagination, not the well-nourished, that is afraid. [MASK] flung open the door to the stairs.
HowardsEnd	49	81961	81923	81972	Dolly	His attitude to his dead wife was curious. He would allude to her, and hear her discussed, but never mentioned her by name. Nor was he interested in the dim, bucolic past. [MASK] was--for the following reason. "Then hadn t
HowardsEnd	45	82027	82016	82061	Charlie	(Oh, I say, that s rather good! [MASK] s Aunt ! I must chaff him about that this evening.) And the man went out and was killed. Yes, I m certain I ve got it right now.
HowardsEnd	48	82149	82134	82182	Dolly	"Because, if he has had enough tea, we ought to go--[MASK] s a good little woman," he continued, "but a little of her goes a long way. I couldn t live near her if you paid me."
HowardsEnd	53	82588	82562	82615	Henry	Then, veering back into warmth, it dwelt on ruddy bricks, flowering plum-trees, and all the tangible joys of spring. [MASK], after allaying her agitation, had taken her over his property, and had explained to her the use and dimensions of the various rooms.
HowardsEnd	56	83838	83797	83853	Henry	She would be told, "Oh, So-and-so s a good sort--a thundering good sort," and find, on meeting him, that he was a brute or a bore. If [MASK] had shown real affection, she would have understood, for affection explains everything.
HowardsEnd	51	83897	83854	83905	Margaret	But he seemed without sentiment. The "thundering good sort" might at any moment become "a fellow for whom I never did have much use, and have less now," and be shaken off cheerily into oblivion. [MASK] had done the same as a schoolgirl.
HowardsEnd	41	84885	84866	84907	Charles	Her chauffeur was not the faithful Crane, but an Italian, who dearly loved making her late. [MASK], watch in hand, though with a level brow, was standing in front of the hotel when they returned.
HowardsEnd	47	85666	85657	85704	Margaret	" There was a concourse of males, and [MASK] and her companions were hustled out and received into the second car. What had happened? As it started off again, the door of a cottage opened, and a girl screamed wildly at them.
HowardsEnd	49	85715	85684	85733	Charles	As it started off again, the door of a cottage opened, and a girl screamed wildly at them. "What is it?" the ladies cried. [MASK] drove them a hundred yards without speaking. Then he said: "It s all right.
HowardsEnd	43	85782	85771	85814	Margaret	"No." "Do PLEASE stop!" said [MASK], leaning forward. She was standing up in the car, the other occupants holding her knees to steady her. "I want to go back, please."
HowardsEnd	48	85910	85910	85958	Charles	[MASK] took no notice. The motor, loaded with refugees, continued to travel very slowly down the hill. "The men are there," chorused the others. "They will see to it." "The men CAN T see to it.
HowardsEnd	58	85965	85915	85973	Charles	The motor, loaded with refugees, continued to travel very slowly down the hill. "The men are there," chorused the others. "They will see to it." "The men CAN T see to it. Oh, this is ridiculous! [MASK], I ask you to stop."
HowardsEnd	48	86032	86001	86049	Charles	She fell on her knees, cut her gloves, shook her hat over her ear. Cries of alarm followed her. "You ve hurt yourself," exclaimed [MASK], jumping after her. "Of course I ve hurt myself!" she retorted.
HowardsEnd	53	86065	86038	86091	Margaret	"Of course I ve hurt myself!" she retorted. "May I ask what--" "There s nothing to ask," said [MASK]. "Your hand s bleeding." "I know." "I m in for a frightful row from the pater."
HowardsEnd	50	86104	86104	86154	Charles	[MASK] had never been in such a position before. It was a woman in revolt who was hobbling away from him--and the sight was too strange to leave any room for anger. He recovered himself when the others caught them up: their sort he understood.
HowardsEnd	48	86192	86187	86235	Charles	"There!" exclaimed [MASK] triumphantly. "It s only a rotten cat." "Got room in your car for a little un? I cut as soon as I saw it wasn t a dog; the chauffeurs are tackling the girl."
HowardsEnd	46	86237	86195	86241	Margaret	"It s only a rotten cat." "Got room in your car for a little un? I cut as soon as I saw it wasn t a dog; the chauffeurs are tackling the girl." But [MASK] walked forward steadily.
HowardsEnd	54	86327	86309	86363	Crane	The second motor came round the corner. "It is all right, madam," said [MASK] in his turn. He had taken to calling her madam. "What s all right? The cat?" "Yes, madam. The girl will receive compensation for it."
HowardsEnd	50	86374	86364	86414	Angelo	"She was a very ruda girla," said [MASK] from the third motor thoughtfully. "Wouldn t you have been rude?" The Italian spread out his hands, implying that he had not thought of rudeness, but would produce it if it pleased her.
HowardsEnd	53	86544	86514	86567	Henry	They were dust, and a stink, and cosmopolitan chatter, and the girl whose cat had been killed had lived more deeply than they. "Oh, [MASK]," she exclaimed, "I have been so naughty," for she had decided to take up this line.
HowardsEnd	47	86668	86654	86701	Margaret	"A dog ll remember you." "Have you hurt yourself, [MASK]?" "Not to speak about; and it s my left hand." "Well, hurry up and change." She obeyed, as did the others.
HowardsEnd	50	86814	86784	86834	Margaret	After walking a little on the road, she had calmed down and had said that she was sorry. His father accepted this explanation, and neither knew that [MASK] had artfully prepared the way for it. It fitted in too well with their view of feminine nature.
HowardsEnd	43	86924	86924	86967	Charles	[MASK] was depressed. That woman had a tongue. She would bring worse disgrace on his father before she had done with them. He strolled out on to the castle mound to think the matter over. The evening was exquisite.
HowardsEnd	46	87095	87053	87099	Evie	"It is all very well," he reflected, "the pater s saying that he will be just to all, but one can t be just indefinitely. Money isn t elastic. What s to happen if [MASK] has a family?
HowardsEnd	45	87302	87280	87325	Margaret	As he sat thinking, one of the ladies left the terrace and walked into the meadow; he recognised her as [MASK] by the white bandage that gleamed on her arm, and put out his cigar, lest the gleam should betray him.
HowardsEnd	48	87357	87326	87374	Charles	She climbed up the mound in zigzags, and at times stooped down, as if she was stroking the turf. It sounds absolutely incredible, but for a moment [MASK] thought that she was in love with him, and had come out to tempt him.
HowardsEnd	42	87409	87409	87451	Margaret	[MASK], who was engaged to his father, and his sister s wedding-guest, kept on her way without noticing him, and he admitted that he had wronged her on this point. But what was she doing?
HowardsEnd	49	87494	87446	87495	Hullo	But what was she doing? Why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her dress in brambles and burrs? As she edged round the keep, she must have got to windward and smelt his cigar-smoke, for she exclaimed, "[MASK]!
HowardsEnd	49	87587	87579	87628	Charles	"That woman means mischief," thought [MASK], and compressed his lips. In a few minutes he followed her indoors, as the ground was getting damp. Mists were rising from the river, and presently it became invisible, though it whispered more loudly.
HowardsEnd	51	87668	87642	87693	Margaret	Next morning a fine mist covered the peninsula. The weather promised well, and the outline of the castle mound grew clearer each moment that [MASK] watched it. Presently she saw the keep, and the sun painted the rubble gold, and charged the white sky with blue.
HowardsEnd	49	87849	87813	87862	Henry	The house was insignificant, but the prospect from it would be an eternal joy, and she thought of all the friends she would have to stop in it, and of the conversion of [MASK] himself to a rural life. Society, too, promised favourably.
HowardsEnd	56	88058	88058	88114	Charles	[MASK] stood by the riverside with folded hands, tragical, while the servant shouted, and was misunderstood by another servant in the garden. Then came a difficulty about a springboard, and soon three people were running backwards and forwards over the meadow, with orders and counter orders and recriminations and apologies.
HowardsEnd	53	88383	88333	88386	Evie	it sounded like, "--cut-yoke--sack-back--" "I can t hear." "--On the bed--tissue-paper--" Gathering that the wedding-dress was on view, and that a visit would be seemly, she went to [MASK] s room.
HowardsEnd	45	88392	88387	88432	Evie	All was hilarity here. [MASK], in a petticoat, was dancing with one of the Anglo-Indian ladies, while the other was adoring yards of white satin. They screamed, they laughed, they sang, and the dog barked.
HowardsEnd	42	88433	88419	88461	Margaret	They screamed, they laughed, they sang, and the dog barked. [MASK] screamed a little too, but without conviction. She could not feel that a wedding was so funny. Perhaps something was missing in her equipment.
HowardsEnd	43	88657	88657	88700	Henry	[MASK] treated a marriage like a funeral, item by item, never raising his eyes to the whole, and "Death, where is thy sting? Love, where is thy victory?" one would exclaim at the close.
HowardsEnd	50	88743	88720	88770	Helen	She asked for the interview, because he was going on to shoot grouse to-morrow, and she was returning to [MASK] in town. "Certainly, dear," said he. "Of course, I have the time. What do you want?"
HowardsEnd	49	89027	88999	89048	Evie	"If there is this nasty curve," she suggested, "couldn t we walk to the church? Not, of course, you and [MASK]; but the rest of us might very well go on first, and that would mean fewer carriages."
HowardsEnd	54	89073	89061	89115	Charles	The Fussells wouldn t like it; they were awfully particular at [MASK] s wedding. My--she--our party was anxious to walk, and certainly the church was just round the corner, and I shouldn t have minded; but the Colonel made a great point of it."
HowardsEnd	52	89127	89077	89129	Margaret	My--she--our party was anxious to walk, and certainly the church was just round the corner, and I shouldn t have minded; but the Colonel made a great point of it." "You men shouldn t be so chivalrous," said [MASK] thoughtfully.
HowardsEnd	48	89177	89130	89178	Burton	"Why not?" She knew why not, but said that she did not know. He then announced that, unless she had anything special to say, he must visit the wine-cellar, and they went off together in search of [MASK].
HowardsEnd	52	89251	89217	89269	Margaret	The wedding-breakfast must be in readiness when they come back from church, and tea would be served in the garden. The sight of so many agitated and serious people made [MASK] smile, but she reflected that they were paid to be serious, and enjoyed being agitated.
HowardsEnd	51	89281	89270	89321	Evie	Here were the lower wheels of the machine that was tossing [MASK] up into nuptial glory. A little boy blocked their way with pig-pails. His mind could not grasp their greatness, and he said: "By your leave; let me pass, please."
HowardsEnd	52	89694	89681	89733	Evie	No one dropped the ring or mispronounced the responses, or trod on [MASK] s train, or cried. In a few minutes the clergymen performed their duty, the register was signed, and they were back in their carriages, negotiating the dangerous curve by the lych-gate.
HowardsEnd	55	89734	89734	89789	Margaret	[MASK] was convinced that they had not been married at all, and that the Norman church had been intent all the time on other business. There were more documents to sign at the house, and the breakfast to eat, and then a few more people dropped in for the garden party.
HowardsEnd	56	89813	89761	89817	Margaret	There were more documents to sign at the house, and the breakfast to eat, and then a few more people dropped in for the garden party. There had been a great many refusals, and after all it was not a very big affair--not as big as [MASK] s would be.
HowardsEnd	46	89834	89818	89864	Henry	She noted the dishes and the strips of red carpet, that outwardly she might give [MASK] what was proper. But inwardly she hoped for something better than this blend of Sunday church and fox-hunting. If only some one had been upset!
HowardsEnd	54	90075	90067	90121	Henry	I am so very glad about it, [MASK] dear; I only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable. You must all remember that we have no practical person among us, except my aunt, and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale."
HowardsEnd	50	90204	90161	90211	Henry	"You desire a hotel?" "Yes, because--well, I mustn t interfere with you. No doubt you want to be married from your old home." "My old home s falling into pieces, [MASK]. I only want my new.
HowardsEnd	45	90320	90280	90325	Charles	Then she turned westward, to gaze at the swirling gold. Just where the river rounded the hill the sun caught it. Fairyland must lie above the bend, and its precious liquid was pouring towards them past [MASK] s bathing-shed.
HowardsEnd	50	90385	90360	90410	Henry	A parlour-maid was preceding them. "Who are those people?" she asked. "They re callers!" exclaimed [MASK]. "It s too late for callers." "Perhaps they re town people who want to see the wedding presents."
HowardsEnd	55	90445	90396	90451	Margaret	"Perhaps they re town people who want to see the wedding presents." "I m not at home yet to townees." "Well, hide among the ruins, and if I can stop them, I will." He thanked her. [MASK] went forward, smiling socially.
HowardsEnd	41	90553	90553	90594	Helen	[MASK] spoke to her two companions, who fell back. Then she bore forward furiously. "They re starving!" she shouted. "I found them starving!" "Who? Why have you come?"
HowardsEnd	51	90678	90633	90684	Helen	Yes, he s done for. We upper classes have ruined him, and I suppose you ll tell me it s the battle of life. Starving. His wife is ill. Starving. She fainted in the train." "[MASK], are you mad?"
HowardsEnd	52	90761	90761	90813	Helen	[MASK] was checked. She had not thought of this, and her hysteria abated. "There was a restaurant car on the train," she said. "Don t be absurd. They aren t starving, and you know it. Now, begin from the beginning.
HowardsEnd	50	90845	90814	90864	Evie	I won t have such theatrical nonsense. How dare you! Yes, how dare you!" she repeated, as anger filled her, "bursting in to [MASK] s wedding in this heartless way. My goodness! but you ve a perverted notion of philanthropy.
HowardsEnd	53	90865	90865	90918	Look"--she	[MASK] indicated the house--"servants, people out of the windows. They think it s some vulgar scandal, and I must explain, Oh no, it s only my sister screaming, and only two hangers-on of ours, whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason. "
HowardsEnd	46	90931	90889	90935	Helen	Oh no, it s only my sister screaming, and only two hangers-on of ours, whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason. " "Kindly take back that word hangers-on, " said [MASK], ominously calm.
HowardsEnd	49	90942	90936	90985	Margaret	"Very well," conceded [MASK], who for all her wrath was determined to avoid a real quarrel. "I, too, am sorry about them, but it beats me why you ve brought them here, or why you re here yourself."
HowardsEnd	53	91450	91432	91485	Helen	"And went into a bank instead?" "I told you all that," said [MASK]; "and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month, and now he s penniless, and I consider that we and our informant are directly to blame."
HowardsEnd	43	91563	91551	91594	Helen	"I brought them. I did it all," cried [MASK]. "I can only advise you to go at once. My sister has put you in a false position, and it is kindest to tell you so.
HowardsEnd	46	91684	91646	91692	Helen	"You re very kind, and no doubt it s a false position, but you make me miserable. I seem no good at all." "It s work he wants," interpreted [MASK]. "Can t you see?"
HowardsEnd	50	91698	91693	91743	Jacky	Then he said: "[MASK], let s go. We re more bother than we re worth. We re costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us, and they never will. There s nothing we re good enough to do."
HowardsEnd	50	91755	91713	91763	Margaret	We re costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us, and they never will. There s nothing we re good enough to do." "We would like to find you work," said [MASK] rather conventionally. "We want to--
HowardsEnd	50	91808	91807	91857	Leonard	But [MASK] was near the abyss, and at such moments men see clearly. "You don t know what you re talking about," he said. "I shall never get work now. If rich people fail at one profession, they can try another.
HowardsEnd	55	92011	91957	92012	Margaret	Their friends gave them money for a little, but in the end they fall over the edge. It s no good. It s the whole world pulling. There always will be rich and poor." He ceased. "Won t you have something to eat?" said [MASK].
HowardsEnd	42	92122	92082	92124	Leonard	They moved to a long table behind which a servant was still standing. Iced cakes, sandwiches innumerable, coffee, claret-cup, champagne, remained almost intact; their overfed guests could do no more. [MASK] refused.
HowardsEnd	48	92225	92186	92234	Henry	"Let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude, I ll do nothing. No doubt you re right logically, and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about [MASK]. Only, I won t have it.
HowardsEnd	48	92333	92324	92372	Helen	"It s his duty to," grumbled [MASK]. "Nor am I concerned with duty. I m concerned with the characters of various people whom we know, and how, things being as they are, things may be made a little better.
HowardsEnd	52	92467	92443	92495	Helen	but they look tired." As they parted, she added: "I haven t nearly done with you, though, [MASK]. You have been most self-indulgent. I can t get over it. You have less restraint rather than more as you grow older.
HowardsEnd	50	92514	92484	92534	Henry	You have less restraint rather than more as you grow older. Think it over and alter yourself, or we shan t have happy lives." She rejoined [MASK]. Fortunately he had been sitting down: these physical matters were important. "Was it townees?"
HowardsEnd	44	92554	92516	92560	Margaret	Fortunately he had been sitting down: these physical matters were important. "Was it townees?" he asked, greeting her with a pleasant smile. "You ll never believe me," said [MASK], sitting down beside him.
HowardsEnd	52	92576	92561	92613	Helen	"It s all right now, but it was my sister." "[MASK] here?" he cried, preparing to rise. "But she refused the invitation. I thought hated weddings." "Don t get up. She has not come to the wedding.
HowardsEnd	51	92658	92614	92665	Henry	I ve bundled her off to the George." Inherently hospitable, he protested. "No; she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them." "Let em all come." "My dear [MASK], did you see them?"
HowardsEnd	48	92687	92666	92714	Helen	"I did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman, certainly." "The brown bunch was [MASK], but did you catch sight of a sea-green and salmon bunch?" "What! are they out bean-feasting?"
HowardsEnd	48	93090	93088	93136	Margaret	But, [MASK], this mustn t be taken as a precedent." "No, of course--of course--" "I can t fit in your proteges every day. Business would suffer." "I can promise you he s the last.
HowardsEnd	49	93256	93234	93283	Prospero	Perhaps the whole visible world rests on it, and if they were one, life itself, like the spirits when [MASK] was reconciled to his brother, might vanish into air, into thin air. "Your protege has made us late," said he.
HowardsEnd	49	93370	93370	93419	Oniton	[MASK], like herself, was imperfect. Its apple-trees were stunted, its castle ruinous. It, too, had suffered in the border warfare between the Anglo-Saxon and the Celt, between things as they are and as they ought to be.
HowardsEnd	50	93629	93606	93656	Margaret	"This won t do. I can t have her in my garden in this state." "Is she--" [MASK] hesitated to add "drunk." Now that she was going to marry him, he had grown particular. He discountenanced risque conversations now.
HowardsEnd	45	93657	93651	93696	Henry	He discountenanced risque conversations now. [MASK] went up to the woman. She raised her face, which gleamed in the twilight like a puff-ball. "Madam, you will be more comfortable at the hotel," he said sharply.
HowardsEnd	51	93825	93812	93863	Henry	She yawned. "There now, I love you." "[MASK], I am awfully sorry." "And pray why?" he asked, and looked at her so sternly that she feared he was ill. He seemed more scandalised than the facts demanded.
HowardsEnd	48	93952	93952	94000	Margaret	[MASK] began to grow frightened. "I don t know what it is all about," she said. "Let s come in." But he thought she was acting. He thought he was trapped. He saw his whole life crumbling. "
HowardsEnd	51	94031	93987	94038	Helen	He thought he was trapped. He saw his whole life crumbling. "Don t you indeed?" he said bitingly. "I do. Allow me to congratulate you on the success of your plan." "This is [MASK] s plan, not mine."
HowardsEnd	48	94061	94054	94102	Margaret	I am amused at your caution, [MASK]. You are quite right--it was necessary. I am a man, and have lived a man s past. I have the honour to release you from your engagement." Still she could not understand.
HowardsEnd	50	94126	94085	94135	Jacky	I have the honour to release you from your engagement." Still she could not understand. She knew of life s seamy side as a theory; she could not grasp it as a fact. More words from [MASK] were necessary--words unequivocal, undenied. "
HowardsEnd	44	94179	94174	94218	Henry	"We were saying--[MASK] and I were just having the fiercest argument, my point being--" Seizing his fur coat from a footman, she offered to help him on. He protested, and there was a playful little scene.
HowardsEnd	50	94229	94219	94269	Henry	"No, let me do that," said [MASK], following. "Thanks so much! You see--he has forgiven me!" The Colonel said gallantly: "I don t expect there s much to forgive." He got into the car.
HowardsEnd	50	94316	94278	94328	Margaret	Maids, courier, and heavier luggage had been sent on earlier by the branch-line. Still chattering, still thanking their host and patronising their future hostess, the guests were borne away. Then [MASK] continued: "So that woman has been your mistress?"
HowardsEnd	49	94820	94793	94842	Nietzsche	If his benefactress wanted intellectual conversation, she must have it. She was more important than his ruined past. "I never got on to [MASK]," he said. "But I always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists."
HowardsEnd	45	94853	94826	94871	Helen	"But I always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists." "Oh no, that s wrong," replied [MASK]. "No superman ever said I want, because I want must lead to the question,
HowardsEnd	47	95053	95042	95089	Helen	"Quite so, quite so," he agreed. [MASK] asked herself why she had snubbed him. Once or twice during the day she had encouraged him to criticise, and then had pulled him up short. Was she afraid of him presuming?
HowardsEnd	48	95233	95233	95281	Margaret	[MASK], though not unkind, was severe and remote. He would not presume to help her, for instance. He had never liked her, and began to think that his original impression was true, and that her sister did not like her either.
HowardsEnd	55	95282	95244	95299	Helen	He would not presume to help her, for instance. He had never liked her, and began to think that his original impression was true, and that her sister did not like her either. [MASK] was certainly lonely. She, who gave away so much, was receiving too little.
HowardsEnd	53	95324	95324	95377	Jacky	[MASK] had announced her discovery when he fetched her from the lawn. After the first shock, he did not mind for himself. By now he had no illusions about his wife, and this was only one new stain on the face of a love that had never been pure.
HowardsEnd	51	95462	95434	95485	Leonard	she asked, half mischievously, and then, "Is she very tired?" "It s better she stops in her room," said [MASK]. "Shall I sit up with her?" "No, thank you; she does not need company."
HowardsEnd	48	95581	95541	95589	Jacky	Don t pretend your marriage has been a happy one. You and she can have nothing in common." He did not deny it, but said shyly: "I suppose that s pretty obvious; but [MASK] never meant to do anybody any harm.
HowardsEnd	49	95695	95655	95704	Helen	"What did your people say?" "They will not have anything to do with us. They had a sort of family council when they heard I was married, and cut us off altogether." [MASK] began to pace up and down the room.
HowardsEnd	51	95764	95726	95777	Leonard	He could answer this. His parents, who were dead, had been in trade; his sisters had married commercial travellers; his brother was a lay-reader. "And your grandparents?" [MASK] told her a secret that he had held shameful up to now.
HowardsEnd	49	95845	95797	95846	Lancashire	"So! From which part?" "Lincolnshire mostly, but my mother s father--he, oddly enough, came from these parts round here." "From this very Shropshire. Yes, that is odd. My mother s people were [MASK].
HowardsEnd	52	95928	95884	95936	Helen	I can bear anything you tell me, and the more you tell the more I shall be able to help. Have they heard anything against her?" He was silent. "I think I have guessed now," said [MASK] very gravely. "I don t think
HowardsEnd	49	96005	95991	96040	Leonard	I blame, not your wife for these things, but men." [MASK] left it at that--so long as she did not guess the man. She stood at the window and slowly pulled up the blinds. The hotel looked over a dark square.
HowardsEnd	52	96159	96115	96167	Helen	I can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again. It stops one thinking." "Settle down to what?" "Oh, just settle down." "And that s to be life!" said [MASK], with a catch in her throat.
HowardsEnd	48	96305	96263	96311	Helen	My books are back again, thanks to you, but they ll never be the same to me again, and I shan t ever again think night in the woods is wonderful." "Why not?" asked [MASK], throwing up the window.
HowardsEnd	44	96423	96423	96467	Leonard	[MASK] could not understand. "If we lived forever, what you say would be true. But we have to die, we have to leave life presently. Injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever.
HowardsEnd	55	96480	96428	96483	Death	"If we lived forever, what you say would be true. But we have to die, we have to leave life presently. Injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever. As it is, we must hold to other things, because [MASK] is coming.
HowardsEnd	48	96873	96828	96876	Love	Behind the coffins and the skeletons that stay the vulgar mind lies something so immense that all that is great in us responds to it. Men of the world may recoil from the charnel-house that they will one day enter, but [MASK] knows better.
HowardsEnd	54	96958	96917	96971	Leonard	"So never give in," continued the girl, and restated again and again the vague yet convincing plea that the Invisible lodges against the Visible. Her excitement grew as she tried to cut the rope that fastened [MASK] to the earth. Woven of bitter experience, it resisted her.
HowardsEnd	45	97032	97025	97070	Henry	She was too bruised to speak to [MASK]; she could pity him, and even determine to marry him, but as yet all lay too deep in her heart for speech. On the surface the sense of his degradation was too strong.
HowardsEnd	54	97176	97129	97183	Henry	It happened long before we ever met, and even if it had happened since, I should be writing the same, I hope. I do understand." But she crossed out "I do understand"; it struck a false note. [MASK] could not bear to be understood.
HowardsEnd	53	97197	97184	97237	Henry	She also crossed out, "It is everything or nothing." [MASK] would resent so strong a grasp of the situation. She must not comment; comment is unfeminine. "I think that ll about do," she thought. Then the sense of his degradation choked her.
HowardsEnd	59	97384	97379	97438	Nature	She knew that out of [MASK] s device we have built a magic that will win us immortality. Far more mysterious than the call of sex to sex is the tenderness that we throw into that call; far wider is the gulf between us and the farmyard than between the farmyard and the garbage that nourishes it.
HowardsEnd	41	97454	97439	97480	Theology	We are evolving, in ways that Science cannot measure, to ends that [MASK] dares not contemplate. "Men did produce one jewel," the gods will say, and, saying, will give us immortality.
HowardsEnd	47	97855	97844	97891	Henry	Her task was not yet over; she ought to tell [MASK] what she had done. This came easily, for she saw him in the hall. The night wind had been rattling the pictures against the wall, and the noise had disturbed him.
HowardsEnd	50	97905	97861	97911	Margaret	This came easily, for she saw him in the hall. The night wind had been rattling the pictures against the wall, and the noise had disturbed him. "Who s there?" he called, quite the householder. [MASK] walked in and past him.
HowardsEnd	45	97951	97924	97969	Henry	"She is best here; so don t lock the front-door." "I thought some one had got in," said [MASK]. "At the same time I told the man that we could do nothing for him.
HowardsEnd	49	98039	98001	98050	Helen	"Probably." "Is she to be shown up to your room?" "I have naturally nothing to say to her; I am going to bed. Will you tell the servants about [MASK]? Could some one go to carry her bag?"
HowardsEnd	54	98082	98041	98095	Henry	Could some one go to carry her bag?" He tapped a little gong, which had been bought to summon the servants. "You must make more noise than that if you want them to hear." [MASK] opened a door, and down the corridor came shouts of laughter.
HowardsEnd	52	98112	98096	98148	Margaret	"Far too much screaming there," he said, and strode towards it. [MASK] went upstairs, uncertain whether to be glad that they had met, or sorry. They had behaved as if nothing had happened, and her deepest instincts told her that this was wrong.
HowardsEnd	58	98208	98208	98266	Henry	[MASK] s inner life had long laid open to her--his intellectual confusion, his obtuseness to personal influence, his strong but furtive passions. Should she refuse him because his outer life corresponded? Perhaps. Perhaps, if the dishonour had been done to her, but it was done long before her day.
HowardsEnd	58	98316	98285	98343	Henry	But she was not a barren theorist. As she undressed, her anger, her regard for the dead, her desire for a scene, all grew weak. [MASK] must have it as he liked, for she loved him, and some day she would use her love to make him a better man.
HowardsEnd	49	98629	98628	98677	Henry	"[MASK] dear, look at me. No, I won t have you shirking. Look at me. There. That s all." "You re referring to last evening," he said huskily. "I have released you from your engagement.
HowardsEnd	51	99022	99013	99064	Margaret	"It is difficult for us," said [MASK]; "but if we are worth marrying, we do guess." "Cut off from decent society and family ties, what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas? Isolated. No one near.
HowardsEnd	48	99091	99081	99129	Margaret	"Not to me." He laughed bitterly. [MASK] went to the sideboard and helped herself to one of the breakfast dishes. Being the last down, she turned out the spirit-lamp that kept them warm. She was tender, but grave.
HowardsEnd	42	99133	99123	99165	Henry	She was tender, but grave. She knew that [MASK] was not so much confessing his soul as pointing out the gulf between the male soul and the female, and she did not desire to hear him on this point.
HowardsEnd	48	99302	99260	99308	Margaret	"I heard of none." "Would you ring the bell, please?" "What to do?" "Why, to inquire." He swaggered up to it tragically, and sounded a peal. [MASK] poured herself out some coffee.
HowardsEnd	52	99363	99355	99407	Henry	"It is no good," said [MASK]. "Those things leak out; you cannot stop a story once it has started. I have known cases of other men--I despised them once, I thought that I m different, I shall never be tempted.
HowardsEnd	46	99410	99365	99411	Margaret--	"Those things leak out; you cannot stop a story once it has started. I have known cases of other men--I despised them once, I thought that I m different, I shall never be tempted. Oh, [MASK]"
HowardsEnd	51	99648	99611	99662	Henry	He is humble and hides it, if, indeed, it still exists. Only in legend does the sinner come forth penitent, but terrible, to conquer pure woman by his resistless power. [MASK] was anxious to be terrible, but had not got it in him.
HowardsEnd	58	99754	99730	99788	Henry	Now and then he asked her whether she could possibly forgive him, and she answered, "I have already forgiven you, [MASK]." She chose her words carefully, and so saved him from panic. She played the girl, until he could rebuild his fortress and hide his soul from the world.
HowardsEnd	57	99797	99770	99827	Henry	She played the girl, until he could rebuild his fortress and hide his soul from the world. When the butler came to clear away, [MASK] was in a very different mood--asked the fellow what he was in such a hurry for, complained of the noise last night in the servants hall.
HowardsEnd	53	100112	100063	100116	Margaret	I don t like to think what it all means." "What did you say in the notes?" "I told you last night." "Oh--ah--yes! Dear, would you like one turn in the garden?" [MASK] took his arm.
HowardsEnd	54	100451	100414	100468	Margaret	"At all events, you mustn t worry," he said. "This is a man s business." He thought intently. "On no account mention it to anybody." [MASK] flushed at advice so elementary, but he was really paving the way for a lie.
HowardsEnd	53	100712	100670	100723	Margaret	He lived for the five minutes that have past, and the five to come; he had the business mind. How did he stand now, as his motor slipped out of Oniton and breasted the great round hills? [MASK] had heard a certain rumour, but was all right.
HowardsEnd	41	101286	101259	101300	Chinese	He had done well in Mods, much to the surprise of those who attended lectures and took proper exercise, and was now glancing disdainfully at [MASK] in case he should some day consent to qualify as a Student Interpreter.
HowardsEnd	43	101458	101416	101459	Tibby	"Why such an early start?" he asked. "Sunrise or something--when I could get away." "So I surmise. Why?" "I don t know what s to be done, [MASK].
HowardsEnd	49	101721	101685	101734	Tibby	Why shouldn t I post it, though?" She sat down again. "My head is rather wretched. I hope that none of your friends are likely to come in." [MASK] locked the door. His friends often found it in this condition.
HowardsEnd	42	101954	101950	101992	Helen	To him thus employed [MASK] returned. She had pulled herself together, but the grave appeal had not vanished from her eyes. "Now for the explanation," she said. "Why didn t I begin with it?
HowardsEnd	50	102068	102055	102105	Tibbikins	"Shall I lock the door again?" "No thanks, [MASK]. You re being very good to me. I want to tell you the story before I go abroad, you must do exactly what you like--treat it as part of the furniture.
HowardsEnd	46	102106	102070	102116	Meg	You re being very good to me. I want to tell you the story before I go abroad, you must do exactly what you like--treat it as part of the furniture. [MASK] cannot have heard it yet, I think.
HowardsEnd	43	102511	102470	102513	Meg	It is only common justice that he should employ the man himself. But he meets the woman, and, like the cur that he is, he refuses, and tries to get rid of them. He makes [MASK] write.
HowardsEnd	51	102853	102818	102869	Helen	The epigram, with its faint whiff of the eighties, meant nothing. But he might have let it off now if his sister had not been ceaselessly beautiful. "You see, [MASK]--have a cigarette--I don t see what I m to do."
HowardsEnd	48	102926	102879	102927	Helen	I dare say you are right. Let them marry. There remains the question of compensation." "Do you want me to adjudicate that too? Had you not better consult an expert?" "This part is in confidence," said [MASK].
HowardsEnd	43	102935	102928	102971	Meg	"It has nothing to do with [MASK], and do not mention it to her. The compensation--I do not see who is to pay it if I don t, and I have already decided on the minimum sum.
HowardsEnd	55	103032	103025	103080	Tibby	"Good God alive!" said [MASK], and went crimson. "Now, what is the good of driblets? To go through life having done one thing--to have raised one person from the abyss; not these puny gifts of shillings and blankets--making the grey more grey.
HowardsEnd	46	103203	103180	103226	Helen	It isn t enough." He could not recover. He was not angry or even shocked, and he saw that [MASK] would still have plenty to live on. But it amazed him to think what haycocks people can make of their lives.
HowardsEnd	41	103400	103400	103441	Helen	[MASK], rehearsing her commission, noticed nothing; the Basts were in her brain, and she retold the crisis in a meditative way, which might have made other men curious. She was seeing whether it would hold.
HowardsEnd	41	103573	103560	103601	Henry	Then she said: "Did she seem worried at any rumour about [MASK]?" He answered, "Yes." "I knew it was that!" she exclaimed. "I ll write to her."
HowardsEnd	41	104307	104307	104348	Paul	[MASK] did send a cablegram. In a few minutes, and without the aid of music, the clergyman made them man and wife, and soon the glass shade had fallen that cuts off married couples from the world.
HowardsEnd	45	104582	104549	104594	Helen	"I don t say there is no standard, for that would destroy morality; only that there can be no standard until our impulses are classified and better understood." [MASK] thanked her for her kind letter--rather a curious reply.
HowardsEnd	55	104960	104916	104971	Margaret	Nerves make her jump out of a moving motor-car, or refuse to be married fashionably. The warrior may well allow her to triumph on such occasions; they move not the imperishable plinth of things that touch his peace. [MASK] had a bad attack of these nerves during the honeymoon.
HowardsEnd	47	105040	105005	105052	Margaret	"I didn t want to bother you," he replied. "Besides, I have only heard for certain this morning." "Where are we to live?" said [MASK], trying to laugh. "I loved the place extraordinarily.
HowardsEnd	48	105063	105046	105094	Henry	"I loved the place extraordinarily. Don t you believe in having a permanent home, [MASK]?" He assured her that she misunderstood him. It is home life that distinguishes us from the foreigner. But he did not believe in a damp home.
HowardsEnd	50	105333	105293	105343	Evie	One might; but he was only gaining time for a plausible answer. Out it came, and he believed it as soon as it was spoken. "The truth is, I took Oniton on account of [MASK]. Don t let this go any further."
HowardsEnd	49	105461	105420	105469	Henry	Well, no harm s done. She has had her country wedding, and I ve got rid of my goose to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school." "Where shall we live, then, [MASK]? I should enjoy living somewhere."
HowardsEnd	49	105589	105545	105594	Henry	Trees and meadows and mountains will only be a spectacle, and the binding force that they once exercised on character must be entrusted to Love alone. May Love be equal to the task! "It is now what?" continued [MASK]. "Nearly October.
HowardsEnd	48	105666	105622	105670	Margaret	I can t be as young as I was, for these alterations don t suit me." "But, my dear, which would you rather have--alterations or rheumatism?" "I see your point," said [MASK], getting up.
HowardsEnd	50	105708	105690	105740	Evie	Only, in the spring, let us look before we leap. I will take warning by [MASK], and not hurry you. Remember that you have a free hand this time. These endless moves must be bad for the furniture, and are certainly expensive."
HowardsEnd	52	105822	105819	105871	Henry	In the morning [MASK] went to business, and his sandwich--a relic this of some prehistoric craving--was always cut by her own hand. He did not rely upon the sandwich for lunch, but liked to have it by him in case he grew hungry at eleven.
HowardsEnd	55	105895	105847	105902	Helen	He did not rely upon the sandwich for lunch, but liked to have it by him in case he grew hungry at eleven. When he had gone, there was the house to look after, and the servants to humanise, and several kettles of [MASK] s to keep on the boil.
HowardsEnd	51	106203	106165	106216	Dolly	"Here s a surprise! How are the boys and the baby?" Boys and the baby were well, and in describing a great row that there had been at the Hilton Tennis Club, [MASK] forgot her news. The wrong people had tried to get in.
HowardsEnd	48	106300	106279	106327	Charles	"Are those the plans? Does it matter my seeing them?" "Of course not." "[MASK] has never seen the plans." "They have only just arrived. Here is the ground floor--no, that s rather difficult.
HowardsEnd	50	106358	106315	106365	Dolly	Here is the ground floor--no, that s rather difficult. Try the elevation. We are to have a good many gables and a picturesque sky-line." "What makes it smell so funny?" said [MASK], after a moment s inspection.
HowardsEnd	50	106422	106382	106432	Margaret	"And WHICH way up is it?" "Just the ordinary way up. That s the sky-line and the part that smells strongest is the sky." "Well, ask me another. [MASK]--oh--what was I going to say?
HowardsEnd	51	106564	106523	106574	Evie	Do write her a line. I will look it up for you." "No, don t bother. That s eight months she has been away, surely?" "Exactly. She left just after [MASK] s wedding. It would be eight months."
HowardsEnd	44	106590	106568	106612	Dolly	It would be eight months." "Just when baby was born, then?" "Just so." [MASK] sighed, and stared enviously round the drawing-room. She was beginning to lose her brightness and good looks.
HowardsEnd	50	106796	106749	106799	Dolly	"Ask another. I suppose you ordered her to." "I gave no such orders. Perhaps she was airing the things. She did undertake to light an occasional fire." "It was far more than an air," said [MASK] solemnly. "
HowardsEnd	48	107099	107082	107130	Dolly	"But the present was so expensive." "Why does that make any difference, [MASK]?" "Still, when it costs over five pounds--I didn t see it, but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a Bond Street shop.
HowardsEnd	47	107286	107278	107325	Charles	"It was a perfectly awful letter. [MASK] said it was the letter of a madman. In the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duck-pond." "Did she give any reasons?"
HowardsEnd	42	107489	107454	107496	Dolly	"Oh yes." "I wonder, then, why he let me ask her to look after the house." "But she s only a farm woman," said [MASK], and her explanation proved correct.
HowardsEnd	44	107590	107556	107600	Margaret	Paradoxical as it may sound, he had something of the artist about him; he would pass over an insult to his daughter sooner than lose a good charwoman for his wife. [MASK] judged it better to settle the little trouble herself.
HowardsEnd	51	107664	107628	107679	Tibby	Then, at the first convenient opportunity, she went down herself, intending to repack her belongings and store them properly in the local warehouse; the plan had been amateurish and a failure. [MASK] promised to accompany her, but at the last moment begged to be excused.
HowardsEnd	43	107754	107750	107793	Dolly	She had also eluded [MASK] s invitation to luncheon. Walking straight up from the station, she crossed the village green and entered the long chestnut avenue that connects it with the church. The church itself stood in the village once.
HowardsEnd	50	108206	108200	108250	Margaret	Left to itself," was [MASK] s opinion, "this county would vote Liberal." The comradeship, not passionate, that is our highest gift as a nation, was promised by it, as by the low brick farm where she called for the key.
HowardsEnd	47	108469	108433	108480	Wilcox	"I cannot let you go on alone. Now don t. You really mustn t. I will direct you myself if it comes to that. I must get my hat. Now"--roguishly--"Mrs. [MASK], don t you move while I m gone."
HowardsEnd	54	108483	108481	108535	Margaret	Stunned, [MASK] did not move from the best parlour, over which the touch of art nouveau had fallen. But the other rooms looked in keeping, though they conveyed the peculiar sadness of a rural interior. Here had lived an elder race, to which we look back with disquietude.
HowardsEnd	51	108795	108774	108825	Evie	The wind was rising, scattering the straw and ruffling the tails of the ducks as they floated in families over [MASK] s pendant. One of those delicious gales of spring, in which leaves still in bud seem to rustle, swept over the land and then fell silent.
HowardsEnd	51	108881	108864	108915	Celandines	The hedge was a half-painted picture which would be finished in a few days. [MASK] grew on its banks, lords and ladies and primroses in the defended hollows; the wild rose-bushes, still bearing their withered hips, showed also the promise of blossom.
HowardsEnd	43	109397	109388	109431	Auntie	The servants need seeing to at the farm. [MASK] is so odd at times." Gathering up her elegancies, she retired defeated, and, as if her departure had loosed a spring, the front door opened at once.
HowardsEnd	52	109674	109640	109692	Margaret	When you kindly undertook to look after things, we never expected you to do so much." "The house has been empty long enough," said the old woman. [MASK] refused to argue. "I dare say we didn t explain," she said civilly.
HowardsEnd	45	109792	109776	109821	Margaret	"Mistake upon mistake." "Well, I don t know," said [MASK], sitting down in one of her own chairs. "I really don t know what s to be done." She could not help laughing.
HowardsEnd	42	110176	110155	110197	Circumstances	"We have no intention of doing so for the present. We happen to need a much larger house. [MASK] oblige us to give big parties. Of course, some day--one never knows, does one?"
HowardsEnd	51	110263	110217	110268	Margaret	You are living here now." "Am I?" "You are living here, and have been for the last ten minutes, if you ask me." It was a senseless remark, but with a queer feeling of disloyalty [MASK] rose from her chair.
HowardsEnd	47	110272	110269	110316	Henry	She felt that [MASK] had been obscurely censured. They went into the dining-room, where the sunlight poured in upon her mother s chiffonier, and upstairs, where many an old god peeped from a new niche. The furniture fitted extraordinarily well.
HowardsEnd	48	110354	110346	110394	Margaret	"The nursery," she said. [MASK] turned away without speaking. At last everything was seen. The kitchen and lobby were still stacked with furniture and straw, but, as far as she could make out, nothing had been broken or scratched.
HowardsEnd	51	110440	110395	110446	Evie	A pathetic display of ingenuity! Then they took a friendly stroll in the garden. It had gone wild since her last visit. The gravel sweep was weedy, and grass had sprung up at the very jaws of the garage. And [MASK] s rockery was only bumps.
HowardsEnd	49	111139	111134	111183	Henry	It was a criticism of [MASK] s character far more trenchant than any of her own. She felt dissatisfied. "But that s all over," she went on. "A better time is coming now, though you ve kept me long enough waiting.
HowardsEnd	51	111217	111168	111219	Margaret	A better time is coming now, though you ve kept me long enough waiting. In a couple of weeks I ll see your light shining through the hedge of an evening. Have you ordered in coals?" "We are not coming," said [MASK] firmly.
HowardsEnd	42	111349	111317	111359	Henry	She had intended to go to the furniture warehouse and give directions for removal, but the muddle had turned out more extensive than she expected, so she decided to consult [MASK]. It was as well that she did this.
HowardsEnd	42	111525	111497	111539	Margaret	On a perfect day, when the sky seemed blue porcelain, and the waves of the discreet little bay beat gentlest of tattoos upon the sand, [MASK] hurried up through the rhododendrons, confronted again by the senselessness of Death.
HowardsEnd	44	111922	111900	111944	Margaret	She returned, without emotion, as fidgety as ever. On the fourth day she was out of danger. "[MASK]--important," it went on: "I should like you to have some companion to take walks with.
HowardsEnd	55	112129	112123	112178	Helen	A sick-bed could recall [MASK], but she was deaf to more human calls; after a glimpse at her aunt, she would retire into her nebulous life behind some poste restante. She scarcely existed; her letters had become dull and infrequent; she had no wants and no curiosity.
HowardsEnd	50	112342	112329	112379	Margaret	What hope was there for her as an old woman? The more [MASK] thought about it the more alarmed she became. For many months she had put the subject away, but it was too big to be slighted now. There was almost a taint of madness.
HowardsEnd	51	112382	112352	112403	Helen	For many months she had put the subject away, but it was too big to be slighted now. There was almost a taint of madness. Were all [MASK] s actions to be governed by a tiny mishap, such as may happen to any young man or woman?
HowardsEnd	41	112451	112424	112465	Helen	It propagated itself where graver intercourse lay barren; it was stronger than sisterly intimacy, stronger than reason or books. In one of her moods [MASK] had confessed that she still "enjoyed" it in a certain sense.
HowardsEnd	56	112466	112466	112522	Paul	[MASK] had faded, but the magic of his caress endured. And where there is enjoyment of the past there may also be reaction--propagation at both ends. Well, it is odd and sad that our minds should be such seed-beds, and we without power to choose the seed.
HowardsEnd	50	112848	112799	112849	Meg	I am living abroad at present, and want to get back as quickly as possible. Will you please tell me where our furniture is? I should like to take out one or two books; the rest are for you. "Forgive me, dearest [MASK].
HowardsEnd	52	112931	112904	112956	Helen	We cannot be in contact with those who are in a morbid state without ourselves deteriorating. To "act for the best" might do [MASK] good, but would do herself harm, and, at the risk of disaster, she kept her colours flying a little longer.
HowardsEnd	44	112987	112976	113020	Oxford	Mellowing rapidly, he was a pleasanter companion than before. [MASK] had done much for him. He had lost his peevishness, and could hide his indifference to people and his interest in food. But he had not grown more human.
HowardsEnd	49	113135	113132	113181	Helen	" "About [MASK]?" "Perhaps he has come across that sort of thing." "He would do all he could, but--" "Oh, you know best. But he is practical." It was the student s belief in experts.
HowardsEnd	48	113284	113283	113331	Tibby	"[MASK] love, what next?" He replied: "It is extraordinary." "Dear, your judgment s often clearer than mine. Have you any notion what s at the back?" "None, unless it s something mental."
HowardsEnd	50	113339	113291	113341	Margaret	He replied: "It is extraordinary." "Dear, your judgment s often clearer than mine. Have you any notion what s at the back?" "None, unless it s something mental." "Oh--that!" said [MASK]. "
HowardsEnd	47	113426	113396	113443	Helen	The familiar barriers, the streets along which she moved, the houses between which she had made her little journeys for so many years, became negligible suddenly. [MASK] seemed one with grimy trees and the traffic and the slowly-flowing slabs of mud.
HowardsEnd	43	113458	113458	113501	Margaret	[MASK] s own faith held firm. She knew the human soul will be merged, if it be merged at all, with the stars and the sea. Yet she felt that her sister had been going amiss for many years.
HowardsEnd	46	113551	113531	113577	Tibby	He might know of some paths in the chaos that were hidden from them, and she determined to take [MASK] s advice and lay the whole matter in his hands. They must call at his office. He could not well make it worse.
HowardsEnd	45	113744	113736	113781	Helen	"But why should it be just like [MASK]? Why should she be allowed to be so queer, and to grow queerer?" "Don t ask me. I m a plain man of business. I live and let live.
HowardsEnd	49	113793	113762	113811	Margaret	"Don t ask me. I m a plain man of business. I live and let live. My advice to you both is, don t worry. [MASK], you ve got black marks again under your eyes. You know that s strictly forbidden.
HowardsEnd	47	114044	114006	114053	Tibby	"I m afraid I cannot. What are the facts? We are all mad more or less, you know, in these days." "The facts are as follows," replied [MASK], who had at times a pedantic lucidity.
HowardsEnd	50	114122	114109	114159	Henry	"She has never behaved like this before, then?" asked [MASK]. "Of course not!" said his wife, with a frown. "Well, my dear, how am I to know?" A senseless spasm of annoyance came over her.
HowardsEnd	50	114166	114138	114188	Helen	"Well, my dear, how am I to know?" A senseless spasm of annoyance came over her. "You know quite well that [MASK] never sins against affection," she said. "You must have noticed that much in her, surely."
HowardsEnd	42	114207	114176	114218	Henry	"You must have noticed that much in her, surely." "Oh yes; she and I have always hit it off together." "No, [MASK]--can t you see?--I don t mean that."
HowardsEnd	48	114226	114219	114267	Charles	She recovered herself, but not before [MASK] had observed her. Stupid and attentive, he was watching the scene. "I was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past, one could trace it back to the heart in the long-run.
HowardsEnd	46	114312	114284	114330	Mad	There s no possible excuse for her now. She is grieving us deeply, and that is why I am sure that she is not well. [MASK] is too terrible a word, but she is not well. I shall never believe it.
HowardsEnd	51	114355	114355	114406	Henry	[MASK] began to grow serious. Ill-health was to him something perfectly definite. Generally well himself, he could not realise that we sink to it by slow gradations. The sick had no rights; they were outside the pale; one could lie to them remorselessly.
HowardsEnd	48	114434	114434	114482	Helen	[MASK], too, was ill. And the plan that he sketched out for her capture, clever and well-meaning as it was, drew its ethics from the wolf-pack. "You want to get hold of her?" he said.
HowardsEnd	51	114635	114624	114675	Henry	Then you can meet her there." "But, [MASK], that s just what she won t let me do. It s part of her--whatever it is--never to see me." "Of course you won t tell her you re going.
HowardsEnd	50	114727	114692	114742	Margaret	If nothing is wrong with her, so much the better. But there ll be the motor round the corner, and we can run her to a specialist in no time." [MASK] shook her head. "It s quite impossible." "Why?"
HowardsEnd	47	114754	114732	114779	Tibby	"It s quite impossible." "Why?" "It doesn t seem impossible to me," said [MASK]; "it is surely a very tippy plan." "It is impossible, because--" She looked at her husband sadly.
HowardsEnd	47	114788	114766	114813	Helen	"It is impossible, because--" She looked at her husband sadly. "It s not the particular language that [MASK] and I talk, if you see my meaning. It would do splendidly for other people, whom I don t blame."
HowardsEnd	49	114854	114851	114900	Henry	"No, [MASK]; it s sweet of you, but I couldn t." "I see," he said; "you have scruples." "I suppose so." "And sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer.
HowardsEnd	47	114993	114993	115040	Margaret	[MASK]!" he groaned. "No education can teach a woman logic. Now, my dear, my time is valuable. Do you want me to help you or not?" "Not in that way." "Answer my question.
HowardsEnd	47	115049	115008	115055	Charles	Now, my dear, my time is valuable. Do you want me to help you or not?" "Not in that way." "Answer my question. Plain question, plain answer. Do--" [MASK] surprised them by interrupting. "
HowardsEnd	51	115158	115117	115168	Charles	"We don t want any more mess." "Who s we ?" asked his father. "My boy, pray who s we ?" "I am sure I beg your pardon," said [MASK]. "I appear always to be intruding."
HowardsEnd	47	115200	115187	115234	Helen	He was determined to push the matter to a satisfactory conclusion, and [MASK] faded as he talked. Her fair, flying hair and eager eyes counted for nothing, for she was ill, without rights, and any of her friends might hunt her.
HowardsEnd	42	115382	115375	115417	Charles	"Is anything wrong with you, [MASK], this afternoon?" "No, pater; but you may be taking on a bigger business than you reckon." "How?" "Don t ask me."
HowardsEnd	49	115570	115564	115613	Henry	She protested no more. Whether [MASK] was right or wrong, he was most kind, and she knew of no other standard by which to judge him. She must trust him absolutely. As soon as he had taken up a business, his obtuseness vanished.
HowardsEnd	53	115798	115798	115851	Dolly	[MASK] stole glances at her father-in-law which he did not answer. In the silence the motor came round to the door. "You re not fit for it," he said anxiously. "Let me go alone. I know exactly what to do."
HowardsEnd	48	115862	115825	115873	Margaret	"You re not fit for it," he said anxiously. "Let me go alone. I know exactly what to do." "Oh yes, I am fit," said [MASK], uncovering her face. "Only most frightfully worried.
HowardsEnd	50	115879	115874	115924	Helen	I cannot feel that [MASK] is really alive. Her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else. Her voice isn t in them. I don t believe your driver really saw her at the station. I wish I d never mentioned it.
HowardsEnd	47	115928	115884	115931	Charles	Her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else. Her voice isn t in them. I don t believe your driver really saw her at the station. I wish I d never mentioned it. I know that [MASK] is vexed.
HowardsEnd	48	115963	115954	116002	Henry	There. Now we ll be off." [MASK] had been looking at her closely. He did not like this breakdown. "Don t you want to tidy yourself?" he asked. "Have I time?" "Yes, plenty."
HowardsEnd	48	116382	116377	116425	Crane	A certain gentleman"--he pointed at [MASK] s back--"won t drive in, but will wait a little short of the front gate, behind the laurels. Have you still the keys of the house?" "Yes." "Well, they aren t wanted.
HowardsEnd	51	116574	116545	116596	Margaret	Was she normal? Was there anything congenital or hereditary? Had anything occurred that was likely to alienate her from her family? "Nothing," answered [MASK], wondering what would have happened if she had added: "Though she did resent my husband s immorality."
HowardsEnd	53	116606	116597	116650	Henry	"She always was highly strung," pursued [MASK], leaning back in the car as it shot past the church. "A tendency to spiritualism and those things, though nothing serious. Musical, literary, artistic, but I should say normal--a very charming girl."
HowardsEnd	51	116651	116621	116672	Margaret	A tendency to spiritualism and those things, though nothing serious. Musical, literary, artistic, but I should say normal--a very charming girl." [MASK] s anger and terror increased every moment. How dare these men label her sister! What horrors lay ahead!
HowardsEnd	48	116848	116815	116863	Helen	She nodded, and the next moment they caught sight of it, at the end of the lane. The car ran silently like a beast of prey. So unsuspicious was [MASK] that she was sitting in the porch, with her back to the road.
HowardsEnd	51	116912	116868	116919	Margaret	Only her head and shoulders were visible. She sat framed in the vine, and one of her hands played with the buds. The wind ruffled her hair, the sun glorified it; she was as she had always been. [MASK] was seated next to the door.
HowardsEnd	49	117140	117132	117181	Helen	She heard him wonder why she had let [MASK] in. "You might have given me a knock with the gate," was another of his remarks. Presently she heard herself speaking. She, or someone for her, said, "Go away."
HowardsEnd	42	117182	117143	117185	Henry	"You might have given me a knock with the gate," was another of his remarks. Presently she heard herself speaking. She, or someone for her, said, "Go away." [MASK] came nearer.
HowardsEnd	51	117210	117205	117256	Helen	What are you doing with [MASK]?" "Oh, dearest, do go away, and I will manage it all." "Manage what?" He stretched out his hand for the keys. She might have obeyed if it had not been for the doctor.
HowardsEnd	48	117280	117235	117283	Helen	He stretched out his hand for the keys. She might have obeyed if it had not been for the doctor. "Stop that at least," she said piteously; the doctor had turned back, and was questioning the driver of [MASK] s cab.
HowardsEnd	44	117443	117422	117466	Margaret	"Could you go in and persuade your sister to come out?" "On what grounds?" said [MASK], suddenly looking him straight in the eyes. Thinking it professional to prevaricate, he murmured something about a nervous breakdown.
HowardsEnd	49	117599	117577	117626	Margaret	Open the door." "Forgive me, but I will not." "I don t agree." [MASK] was silent. "This business is as broad as it s long," contributed the doctor. "We had better all work together.
HowardsEnd	48	117758	117736	117784	Margaret	He himself might need support, for there was trouble ahead. "It all turns on affection now," said [MASK]. "Affection. Don t you see?" Resuming her usual methods, she wrote the word on the house with her finger.
HowardsEnd	50	117859	117847	117897	Margaret	"You don t know what you want yourselves," said [MASK], folding her arms. "For one sensible remark I will let you in. But you cannot make it. You would trouble my sister for no reason. I will not permit it.
HowardsEnd	46	117949	117946	117992	Henry	"Now, [MASK], you," she said gently. None of her bitterness had been directed at him. "Go away now, dear. I shall want your advice later, no doubt. Forgive me if I have been cross.
HowardsEnd	47	118156	118147	118194	Helen	Then she would have kissed her sister, but [MASK], in a dignified voice, that came strangely from her, said: "Convenient! You did not tell me that the books were unpacked. I have found nearly everything that I want."
HowardsEnd	46	118242	118235	118281	Helen	"I suppose not," said [MASK], turning away, and crying a very little. "But one loses faith in everything after this." "We thought it was illness, but even then--I haven t behaved worthily."
HowardsEnd	53	118282	118253	118306	Helen	"But one loses faith in everything after this." "We thought it was illness, but even then--I haven t behaved worthily." [MASK] selected another book. "I ought not to have consulted any one. What would our father have thought of me?"
HowardsEnd	50	118341	118307	118357	Helen	She did not think of questioning her sister, or of rebuking her. Both might be necessary in the future, but she had first to purge a greater crime than any that [MASK] could have committed--that want of confidence that is the work of the devil.
HowardsEnd	52	118577	118538	118590	Helen	It would not be right for them to pardon it. So I must live where I am not known." "But why didn t you tell me, dearest?" "Yes," replied [MASK] judicially. "I might have, but decided to wait."
HowardsEnd	48	118657	118634	118682	Monica	But for her, I am and have been and always wish to be alone." "I have not heard of [MASK]." "You wouldn t have. She s an Italian--by birth at least. She makes her living by journalism.
HowardsEnd	45	118772	118759	118804	Helen	"You must not think that we shall never meet," said [MASK], with a measured kindness. "I shall always have a room for you when you can be spared, and the longer you can be with me the better.
HowardsEnd	51	118812	118779	118830	Meg	"I shall always have a room for you when you can be spared, and the longer you can be with me the better. But you haven t understood yet, [MASK], and of course it is very difficult for you. This is a shock to you.
HowardsEnd	51	118899	118896	118947	Meg	"Oh, [MASK] dear, why do we talk at all?" She dropped a book and sighed wearily. Then, recovering herself, she said: "Tell me, how is it that all the books are down here?" "Series of mistakes."
HowardsEnd	49	118996	118960	119009	Margaret	"All." "Who lives here, then?" "No one." "I suppose you are letting it, though." "The house is dead," said [MASK], with a frown. "Why worry on about it?"
HowardsEnd	45	119032	119002	119047	Helen	"Why worry on about it?" "But I am interested. You talk as if I had lost all my interest in life. I am still [MASK], I hope. Now this hasn t the feel of a dead house.
HowardsEnd	41	119173	119163	119204	Meg	"I have stopped being a schoolgirl, and, [MASK], once again, I m not being unkind. But as for fitting in with your English life--no, put it out of your head at once.
HowardsEnd	49	119219	119214	119263	Margaret	It s unthinkable." [MASK] could not contradict her. It was appalling to see her quietly moving forward with her plans, not bitter or excitable, neither asserting innocence nor confessing guilt, merely desiring freedom and the company of those who would not blame her.
HowardsEnd	51	119272	119225	119276	Margaret	It was appalling to see her quietly moving forward with her plans, not bitter or excitable, neither asserting innocence nor confessing guilt, merely desiring freedom and the company of those who would not blame her. She had been through--how much? [MASK] did not know.
HowardsEnd	46	119301	119277	119323	Helen	But it was enough to part her from old habits as well as old friends. "Tell me about yourself," said [MASK], who had chosen her books, and was lingering over the furniture. "There s nothing to tell."
HowardsEnd	53	119332	119316	119369	Meg	"There s nothing to tell." "But your marriage has been happy, [MASK]?" "Yes, but I don t feel inclined to talk." "You feel as I do." "Not that, but I can t." "No more can I.
HowardsEnd	49	119396	119348	119397	Helen	"You feel as I do." "Not that, but I can t." "No more can I. It is a nuisance, but no good trying." Something had come between them. Perhaps it was Society, which henceforward would exclude [MASK].
HowardsEnd	48	119438	119419	119467	Meg	Both suffered acutely, and were not comforted by the knowledge that affection survived. "Look here, [MASK], is the coast clear?" "You mean that you want to go away from me?" "I suppose so--dear old lady!
HowardsEnd	50	119580	119550	119600	Margaret	"I am glad to have seen you and the things." She looked at the bookcase lovingly, as if she was saying farewell to the past. [MASK] unbolted the door. She remarked: "The car has gone, and here s your cab."
HowardsEnd	51	119649	119616	119667	Henry	The spring had never seemed more beautiful. The driver, who was leaning on the gate, called out, "Please, lady, a message," and handed her [MASK] s visiting-card through the bars. "How did this come?" she asked.
HowardsEnd	48	119721	119712	119760	Helen	Il faut dormir sur ce sujet." while [MASK] was to be found une comfortable chambre a l hotel. The final sentence displeased her greatly until she remembered that the Charles s had only one spare room, and so could not invite a third guest.
HowardsEnd	50	120109	120076	120126	Helen	There s no carpet there." They went in, and each minute their talk became more natural. "Oh, WHAT a place for mother s chiffonier!" cried [MASK]. "Look at the chairs, though." "Oh, look at them!
HowardsEnd	48	120211	120211	120259	Helen	[MASK] sat down in it. "Ye--es. The window s too high." "Try a drawing-room chair." "No, I don t like the drawing-room so much. The beam has been match-boarded.
HowardsEnd	50	120270	120252	120302	Helen	The beam has been match-boarded. It would have been so beautiful otherwise." "[MASK], what a memory you have for some things! You re perfectly right. It s a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women.
HowardsEnd	52	120333	120286	120338	Tibby	It s a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women. Men don t know what we want--" "And never will." "I don t agree. In two thousand years they ll know. Look where [MASK] spilt the soup."
HowardsEnd	48	120476	120431	120479	Tibby	There was some rhyme, Tea, coffee--coffee tea, that she said to him every morning at breakfast. Wait a minute--how did it go?" "I know--no, I don t. What a detestable boy [MASK] was!"
HowardsEnd	51	120508	120480	120531	Helen	"But the rhyme was simply awful. No decent person could put up with it." "Ah, that greengage-tree," cried [MASK], as if the garden was also part of their childhood. "Why do I connect it with dumb-bells?
HowardsEnd	53	120550	120532	120585	Margaret	And there come the chickens. The grass wants cutting. I love yellow-hammers." [MASK] interrupted her. "I have got it," she announced. " Tea, tea, coffee, tea, Or chocolaritee.'" "That every morning for three weeks.
HowardsEnd	53	120756	120713	120766	Helen	And all the time their salvation was lying round them--the past sanctifying the present; the present, with wild heart-throb, declaring that there would after all be a future with laughter and the voices of children. [MASK], still smiling, came up to her sister.
HowardsEnd	50	120803	120803	120853	Margaret	[MASK] went to the kitchen, and struggled between packing-cases to the window. Their visitor was only a little boy with a tin can. And triviality returned. "Little boy, what do you want?" "Please, I am the milk."
HowardsEnd	44	120891	120868	120912	Helen	"Yes, please." "Then take it back and say we require no milk." While she called to [MASK], "No, it s not the siege, but possibly an attempt to provision us against one."
HowardsEnd	41	120921	120913	120954	Helen	"But I like milk," cried [MASK]. "Why send it away?" "Do you? Oh, very well. But we ve nothing to put it in, and he wants the can."
HowardsEnd	50	121035	120995	121045	Helen	"Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week?" The child hung his head. "Well, run away and do it again." "Nice little boy," whispered [MASK]. "I say, what s your name?
HowardsEnd	51	121214	121170	121221	Helen	"What do you mean?" "I don t know." "Because I probably agree with you." "It kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live." "I do agree," said [MASK], as she sipped the milk.
HowardsEnd	53	121341	121329	121382	Helen	"No, I won t tell you yet," said [MASK], "because you may laugh or be angry. Let s go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing." They opened window after window, till the inside, too, was rustling to the spring.
HowardsEnd	47	121391	121365	121412	Helen	They opened window after window, till the inside, too, was rustling to the spring. Curtains blew, picture frames tapped cheerfully. [MASK] uttered cries of excitement as she found this bed obviously in its right place, that in its wrong one.
HowardsEnd	45	121498	121454	121499	Margaret	As they leant out, looking westward, she said: "About my idea. Couldn t you and I camp out in this house for the night?" "I don t think we could well do that," said [MASK].
HowardsEnd	44	121525	121500	121544	Henry	"Here are beds, tables, towels--" "I know; but the house isn t supposed to be slept in, and [MASK] s suggestion was--" "I require no suggestions. I shall not alter anything in my plans.
HowardsEnd	44	121665	121638	121682	Tom	This is ours. Our furniture, our sort of people coming to the door. Do let us camp out, just one night, and [MASK] shall feed us on eggs and milk. Why not? It s a moon."
HowardsEnd	48	121855	121827	121875	Helen	"Because my plans--" "--which you change in a moment." "Then because my life is great and theirs are little," said [MASK], taking fire. "I know of things they can t know of, and so do you.
HowardsEnd	50	121950	121936	121986	Margaret	"It would be lovely to have you once more alone," said [MASK]. "It may be a chance in a thousand." "Yes, and we could talk." She dropped her voice. "It won t be a very glorious story.
HowardsEnd	54	122090	122069	122123	Henry	In spite of imagination and poetry--perhaps on account of them--she could sympathise with the technical attitude that [MASK] would adopt. If possible, she would be technical, too. A night s lodging--and they demanded no more--need not involve the discussion of general principles.
HowardsEnd	45	122169	122134	122179	Helen	"We shan t consult him." "Go if you like; I should have stopped without leave." It was the touch of selfishness, which was not enough to mar [MASK] s character, and even added to its beauty.
HowardsEnd	56	122330	122307	122363	Henry	The tragedy began quietly enough, and, like many another talk, by the man s deft assertion of his superiority. [MASK] heard her arguing with the driver, stepped out and settled the fellow, who was inclined to be rude, and then led the way to some chairs on the lawn.
HowardsEnd	56	122364	122364	122420	Dolly	[MASK], who had not been "told," ran out with offers of tea. He refused them, and ordered them to wheel baby s perambulator away, as they desired to be alone. "But the diddums can t listen; he isn t nine months old," she pleaded.
HowardsEnd	53	122439	122403	122456	Baby	But the diddums can t listen; he isn t nine months old," she pleaded. "That s not what I was saying," retorted her father-in-law. [MASK] was wheeled out of earshot, and did not hear about the crisis till later years.
HowardsEnd	56	122463	122457	122513	Margaret	It was now the turn of [MASK]. "Is it what we feared?" he asked. "It is." "Dear girl," he began, "there is a troublesome business ahead of us, and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through.
HowardsEnd	52	122515	122515	122567	Margaret	[MASK] bent her head. "I am obliged to question you on subjects we d both prefer to leave untouched. As you know, I am not one of your Bernard Shaws who consider nothing sacred. To speak as I must will pain me, but there are occasions--
HowardsEnd	50	122595	122577	122627	Margaret	I am a man of the world, and you are a most exceptional woman." All [MASK] s senses forsook her. She blushed, and looked past him at the Six Hills, covered with spring herbage. Noting her colour, he grew still more kind.
HowardsEnd	50	122672	122628	122678	Margaret	"I see that you feel as I felt when--My poor little wife! Oh, be brave! Just one or two questions, and I have done with you. Was your sister wearing a wedding-ring?" [MASK] stammered a "No."
HowardsEnd	52	122835	122791	122843	Margaret	Then speech came, and she said slowly: "Seducer? No; I do not know her seducer s name." "Would she not tell you?" "I never even asked her who seduced her," said [MASK], dwelling on the hateful word thoughtfully.
HowardsEnd	47	122955	122940	122987	Henry	"As you like." "Have you anything else to ask me, [MASK]?" "Next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything. I have often noticed your insight, dear. I only wish my own was as good.
HowardsEnd	46	123023	122979	123025	Charles	I only wish my own was as good. You may have guessed something, even though your sister said nothing. The slightest hint would help us." "Who is we ?" "I thought it best to ring up [MASK]."
HowardsEnd	55	123043	123038	123093	Charles	"This news will give [MASK] disproportionate pain." "He has at once gone to call on your brother." "That too was unnecessary." "Let me explain, dear, how the matter stands. You don t think that I and my son are other than gentlemen?
HowardsEnd	48	123097	123068	123116	Helen	"Let me explain, dear, how the matter stands. You don t think that I and my son are other than gentlemen? It is in [MASK] s interests that we are acting. It is still not too late to save her name."
HowardsEnd	41	123118	123105	123146	Margaret	It is still not too late to save her name." Then [MASK] hit out for the first time. "Are we to make her seducer marry her?" she asked. "If possible, yes."
HowardsEnd	50	123150	123147	123197	Henry	"But, [MASK], suppose he turned out to be married already? One has heard of such cases." "In that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct, and be thrashed within an inch of his life." So her first blow missed.
HowardsEnd	50	123215	123198	123248	Henry	She was thankful of it. What had tempted her to imperil both of their lives. [MASK] s obtuseness had saved her as well as himself. Exhausted with anger, she sat down again, blinking at him as he told her as much as he thought fit.
HowardsEnd	48	123429	123418	123466	Helen	"It is an odd request, but you know what [MASK] is and what women in her state are." He frowned, and moved irritably. "She has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good.
HowardsEnd	50	123559	123549	123599	Helen	"I don t agree there, my dear! [MASK] will have her share of the goods wherever she goes--possibly more than her share, for you are so fond of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies, wouldn t you?
HowardsEnd	46	123716	123685	123731	Margaret	I do not see why she wants to stay the night there. She will only catch cold." "Leave it that you don t see," cried [MASK]. "Call it fancy. But realise that fancy is a scientific fact.
HowardsEnd	51	123732	123732	123783	Helen	[MASK] is fanciful, and wants to." Then he surprised her--a rare occurrence. He shot an unexpected bolt. "If she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two. We shall never get her out of the house, perhaps."
HowardsEnd	51	123789	123771	123822	Margaret	We shall never get her out of the house, perhaps." "Well?" said [MASK], with the precipice in sight. "And suppose we don t get her out of the house? Would it matter? She would do no one any harm."
HowardsEnd	47	123831	123798	123845	Henry	And suppose we don t get her out of the house? Would it matter? She would do no one any harm." Again the irritated gesture. "No, [MASK]," she panted, receding. "I didn t mean that.
HowardsEnd	49	123999	123993	124042	Helen	"In what way? Will [MASK] s condition depreciate the property?" "My dear, you are forgetting yourself." "I think you yourself recommended plain speaking." They looked at each other in amazement. The precipice was at their feet now.
HowardsEnd	50	124125	124095	124145	Helen	I should be false to my position in society if I did." She controlled herself for the last time. "No, let us go back to [MASK] s request," she said. "It is unreasonable, but the request of an unhappy girl.
HowardsEnd	49	124256	124233	124282	Margaret	"As I have actually been forgiven--?" "Never mind for the moment what I mean by that," said [MASK]. "Answer my question." Perhaps some hint of her meaning did dawn on him. If so, he blotted it out.
HowardsEnd	50	124443	124417	124467	Henry	She was transfigured. "Not any more of this!" she cried. "You shall see the connection if it kills you, [MASK]! You have had a mistress--I forgave you. My sister has a lover--you drive her from the house.
HowardsEnd	42	124615	124581	124623	Helen	No one has ever told what you are--muddled, criminally muddled. Men like you use repentance as a blind, so don t repent. Only say to yourself, What [MASK] has done, I ve done. "
HowardsEnd	52	124782	124782	124834	Margaret	[MASK] loosed his hands. He went into the house, wiping first one and then the other on his handkerchief. For a little she stood looking at the Six Hills, tombs of warriors, breasts of the spring. Then she passed out into what was now the evening.
HowardsEnd	41	124984	124963	125004	Charles	But this was a concession to morality, it formed no part of his main scheme. Honest and hearty was [MASK] s dislike, and the past spread itself out very clearly before him; hatred is a skilful compositor.
HowardsEnd	49	125406	125366	125415	Tibby	"In what sense?" "If a man played about with my sister, I d send a bullet through him, but perhaps you don t mind." "I mind very much," protested [MASK]. "Who d ye suspect, then?
HowardsEnd	51	125460	125437	125488	Charles	" Involuntarily he blushed. He had remembered the scene in his Oxford rooms. "You are hiding something," said [MASK]. As interviews go, he got the best of this one. "When you saw her last, did she mention any one s name?
HowardsEnd	49	125596	125550	125599	Tibby	My aunt told me about some rag-tag. Was she full of them when you saw her? Is there a man? Did she speak of the man? Or--look here--have you had any dealings with him?" [MASK] was silent.
HowardsEnd	49	125664	125628	125677	Helen	He had a strong regard for honesty, and his word, once given, had always been kept up to now. He was deeply vexed, not only for the harm he had done [MASK], but for the flaw he had discovered in his own equipment.
HowardsEnd	46	125777	125740	125786	Leonard	The foot of the tree was in shadow, since the moon was still hidden behind the house. But above, to right, to left, down the long meadow the moonlight was streaming. [MASK] seemed not a man, but a cause.
HowardsEnd	53	125818	125818	125871	Helen	[MASK] forgot people. They were husks that had enclosed her emotion. She could pity, or sacrifice herself, or have instincts, but had she ever loved in the noblest way, where man and woman, having lost themselves in sex, desire to lose sex itself in comradeship?
HowardsEnd	50	125872	125831	125881	Margaret	She could pity, or sacrifice herself, or have instincts, but had she ever loved in the noblest way, where man and woman, having lost themselves in sex, desire to lose sex itself in comradeship? [MASK] wondered, but said no word of blame.
HowardsEnd	42	125884	125882	125924	Helen	This was [MASK] s evening. Troubles enough lay ahead of her--the loss of friends and of social advantages, the agony, the supreme agony, of motherhood, which is not even yet a matter of common knowledge.
HowardsEnd	46	125970	125925	125971	Helen	For the present let the moon shine brightly and the breezes of the spring blow gently, dying away from the gale of the day, and let the earth, that brings increase, bring peace. Not even to herself dare she blame [MASK].
HowardsEnd	47	126016	125989	126036	Helen	Morality can tell us that murder is worse than stealing, and group most sins in an order all must approve, but it cannot group [MASK]. The surer its pronouncements on this point, the surer may we be that morality is not speaking.
HowardsEnd	50	126287	126273	126323	Leonard	I had not seen her, and had talked for a long time to [MASK]--I had snubbed him for no reason, and that should have warned me I was in danger. So when the notes came I wanted us to go to you for an explanation.
HowardsEnd	50	126470	126431	126481	Meg	He is not to blame. He would have gone on worshipping me. I want never to see him again, though it sounds appalling. I wanted to give him money and feel finished. Oh, [MASK], the little that is known about these things!"
HowardsEnd	46	126524	126524	126570	Margaret	[MASK] did not speak for a moment. So tired was she that her attention had actually wandered to the teeth--the teeth that had been thrust into the tree s bark to medicate it. From where she sat she could see them gleam.
HowardsEnd	59	126580	126532	126591	Leonard	So tired was she that her attention had actually wandered to the teeth--the teeth that had been thrust into the tree s bark to medicate it. From where she sat she could see them gleam. She had been trying to count them. "[MASK] is a better growth than madness," she said.
HowardsEnd	50	126737	126717	126767	Henry	"Because in death--I agree." "Not quite. I feel that you and I and [MASK] are only fragments of that woman s mind. She knows everything. She is everything. She is the house, and the tree that leans over it.
HowardsEnd	50	126842	126796	126846	Henry	I cannot believe that knowledge such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine. She knew about realities. She knew when people were in love, though she was not in the room. I don t doubt that she knew when [MASK] deceived her."
HowardsEnd	42	127018	126978	127020	Helen	"We shall be that everywhere, and for ever." "But affectionate tourists." "But tourists who pretend each hotel is their home." "I can t pretend very long," said [MASK]. "
HowardsEnd	43	127148	127142	127185	Monica	Should I get on with your [MASK]?" "You would not, but I am serious in asking you." "Still, no more plans now. And no more reminiscences." They were silent for a little.
HowardsEnd	50	127393	127350	127400	Margaret	They passed upstairs, kissed, and amidst the endless iterations fell asleep. The house had enshadowed the tree at first, but as the moon rose higher the two disentangled, and were clear for a few moments at midnight. [MASK] awoke and looked into the garden.
HowardsEnd	51	127535	127534	127585	Jacky	Even [MASK] noticed the change in him. Most terrible were his sufferings when he awoke from sleep. Sometimes he was happy at first, but grew conscious of a burden hanging to him and weighing down his thoughts when they would move. Or little irons scorched his body.
HowardsEnd	50	127712	127700	127750	Leonard	It is a knife that probes far deeper than the evil. [MASK] was driven straight through its torments and emerged pure, but enfeebled--a better man, who would never lose control of himself again, but also a smaller man, who had less to control.
HowardsEnd	48	127776	127751	127799	Leonard	Nor did purity mean peace. The use of the knife can become a habit as hard to shake off as passion itself, and [MASK] continued to start with a cry out of dreams. He built up a situation that was far enough from the truth.
HowardsEnd	53	127806	127787	127840	Helen	He built up a situation that was far enough from the truth. It never occurred to him that [MASK] was to blame. He forgot the intensity of their talk, the charm that had been lent him by sincerity, the magic of Oniton under darkness and of the whispering river.
HowardsEnd	58	127846	127846	127904	Leonard	[MASK] had been ruined absolutely, and had appeared to her as a man apart, isolated from the world. A real man, who cared for adventure and beauty, who desired to live decently and pay his way, who could have travelled more gloriously through life than the juggernaut car that was crushing him.
HowardsEnd	49	128179	128175	128224	Helen	It is true that [MASK] offered him five thousand pounds, but such a sum meant nothing to him. He could not see that the girl was desperately righting herself, and trying to save something out of the disaster, if it was only five thousand pounds.
HowardsEnd	41	128423	128391	128432	Leonard	Society is based on the family, and the clever wastrel can exploit this indefinitely. Without a generous thought on either side, pounds and pounds passed. The donors disliked [MASK], and he grew to hate them intensely.
HowardsEnd	57	128522	128498	128555	Jacky	When his brother, the lay-reader, did not reply to a letter, he wrote again, saying that he and [MASK] would come down to his village on foot. He did not intend this as blackmail. Still the brother sent a postal order, and it became part of the system.
HowardsEnd	57	128673	128641	128698	Jacky	It is a hard saying, and a hard man wrote it, but it lies at the root of all character. And the other bright spot was his tenderness for [MASK]. He pitied her with nobility now--not the contemptuous pity of a man who sticks to a woman through thick and thin.
HowardsEnd	44	129229	129195	129239	Helen	He wanted her hardness now. That cold, intellectual nature of hers would be just, if unkind. He would do whatever she told him, even if he had to see [MASK]. That was the supreme punishment she would exact.
HowardsEnd	48	129406	129374	129422	Leonard	Most of them stared, some said, "What s that to you?" but one, who had not yet acquired reticence, told him what he wished. [MASK] could not learn the private address. That necessitated more trouble with directories and tubes.
HowardsEnd	47	129479	129479	129526	Leonard	[MASK] lowered his eyes to them after ringing the bell. He felt in curious health; doors seemed to be opening and shutting inside his body, and he had been obliged to sleep sitting up in bed, with his back propped against the wall.
HowardsEnd	46	129584	129553	129599	Margaret	he asked. "She s out," was the answer. "When will she be back?" "I ll ask," said the parlourmaid. [MASK] had given instructions that no one who mentioned her name should ever be rebuffed.
HowardsEnd	50	130075	130058	130108	Jacky	" By a rending effort of the will he woke the rest of the room up. [MASK], the bed, their food, their clothes on the chair, gradually entered his consciousness, and the horror vanished outwards, like a ring that is spreading through water.
HowardsEnd	48	130113	130109	130157	Jacky	"I say, [MASK], I m going out for a bit." She was breathing regularly. The patch of light fell clear of the striped blanket, and began to cover the shawl that lay over her feet. Why had he been afraid?
HowardsEnd	43	130330	130330	130373	Leonard	[MASK] passed out and made his way down to the station. The train, though it did not start for an hour, was already drawn up at the end of the platform, and he lay down in it and slept.
HowardsEnd	51	130779	130754	130805	England	That they were men of the finest type only the sentimentalists can declare. But they kept to the life of daylight. They are [MASK] s hope. Clumsily they carry forward the torch of the sun, until such time as the nation sees fit to take it up.
HowardsEnd	46	130938	130908	130954	Leonard	He is a destroyer. He prepares the way for cosmopolitanism, and though his ambitions may be fulfilled, the earth that he inherits will be grey. To [MASK], intent on his private sin, there came the conviction of innate goodness elsewhere.
HowardsEnd	54	131029	131029	131083	Squalor	[MASK] and tragedy can beckon to all that is great in us, and strengthen the wings of love. They can beckon; it is not certain that they will, for they are not love s servants. But they can beckon, and the knowledge of this incredible truth comforted him.
HowardsEnd	49	131193	131148	131197	Margaret	He entered a garden, steadied himself against a motor-car that he found in it, found a door open and entered a house. Yes, it would be very easy. From a room to the left he heard voices, [MASK] s amongst them.
HowardsEnd	51	131316	131275	131326	Charles	A stick, very bright, descended. It hurt him, not where it descended, but in the heart. Books fell over him in a shower. Nothing had sense. "Get some water," commanded [MASK], who had all through kept very calm. "
HowardsEnd	44	131614	131592	131636	Charles	He raised his eyes, and gave his son more open a look of tenderness than he usually ventured. He saw [MASK] as little boy and strong man in one. Though his wife had proved unstable his children were left to him.
HowardsEnd	52	131642	131624	131676	Charles	Though his wife had proved unstable his children were left to him. After midnight he tapped on [MASK] s door. "I can t sleep," he said. "I had better have a talk with you and get it over." He complained of the heat.
HowardsEnd	50	131677	131646	131696	Charles	"I can t sleep," he said. "I had better have a talk with you and get it over." He complained of the heat. [MASK] took him out into the garden, and they paced up and down in their dressing-gowns.
HowardsEnd	50	131779	131772	131822	Charles	The house is mine--and, [MASK], it will be yours--and when I say that no one is to live there, I mean that no one is to live there. I won t have it." He looked angrily at the moon. "
HowardsEnd	50	131910	131903	131953	Helen	I shall do what I can for [MASK], but on the understanding that they clear out of the house at once. Do you see? That is a sine qua non." "Then at eight to-morrow I may go up in the car?"
HowardsEnd	49	131977	131930	131979	Charles	That is a sine qua non." "Then at eight to-morrow I may go up in the car?" "Eight or earlier. Say that you are acting as my representative, and, of course, use no violence, [MASK]."
HowardsEnd	49	132083	132060	132109	Charles	He found his father in the garden shading his eyes from the sun. "It has been pretty horrible," said [MASK] gravely. "They were there, and they had the man up there with them too." "What--what man?"
HowardsEnd	43	132143	132136	132179	Charles	"In your mother s house! [MASK], in your mother s house!" "I know, pater. That was what I felt. As a matter of fact, there is no need to trouble about the man.
HowardsEnd	51	132600	132579	132630	Charles	"Then what?" "He pulled over the bookcase, as I said, and fell," said [MASK], with a sigh. It was no fun doing errands for his father, who was never quite satisfied. "But the real cause was heart disease?
HowardsEnd	47	132667	132631	132678	Charles	Of that you re sure?" "That or a fit. However, we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury topics." They went in to breakfast. [MASK] had a racking headache, consequent on motoring before food.
HowardsEnd	42	132712	132706	132748	Hilton	He saw himself obliged to leave [MASK]. One could not afford to live near the scene of a scandal--it was not fair on one s wife. His comfort was that the pater s eyes were opened at last.
HowardsEnd	46	132763	132736	132782	Margaret	His comfort was that the pater s eyes were opened at last. There would be a horrible smash-up, and probably a separation from [MASK]; then they would all start again, more as they had been in his mother s time.
HowardsEnd	51	132811	132783	132834	Dolly	"I think I ll go round to the police-station," said his father when breakfast was over. "What for?" cried [MASK], who had still not been "told." "Very well, sir. Which car will you have?"
HowardsEnd	52	132910	132910	132962	Charles	[MASK] hardened his mouth. "You young fellows one idea is to get into a motor. I tell you, I want to walk; I m very fond of walking." "Oh, all right; I m about the house if you want me for anything.
HowardsEnd	42	133005	133005	133047	Charles	[MASK] did not like it; he was uneasy about his father, who did not seem himself this morning. There was a petulant touch about him--more like a woman. Could it be that he was growing old?
HowardsEnd	44	133271	133266	133310	Margaret	, it seemed impossible to [MASK] that healthy life should re-emerge. Events succeeded in a logical, yet senseless, train. People lost their humanity, and took values as arbitrary as those in a pack of playing-cards.
HowardsEnd	52	133658	133618	133670	Leonard	She moved through the sunlit garden, gathering narcissi, crimson-eyed and white. There was nothing else to be done; the time for telegrams and anger was over and it seemed wisest that the hands of [MASK] should be folded on his breast and be filled with flowers.
HowardsEnd	51	133682	133681	133732	Squalor	Let [MASK] be turned into Tragedy, whose eyes are the stars, and whose hands hold the sunset and the dawn. And even the influx of officials, even the return of the doctor, vulgar and acute, could not shake her belief in the eternity of beauty.
HowardsEnd	50	134512	134497	134547	Henry	He would settle down--though she could not realise this. In her eyes [MASK] was always moving and causing others to move, until the ends of the earth met. But in time he must get too tired to move, and settle down. What next?
HowardsEnd	54	134568	134530	134584	Margaret	But in time he must get too tired to move, and settle down. What next? The inevitable word. The release of the soul to its appropriate Heaven. Would they meet in it? [MASK] believed in immortality for herself. An eternal future had always seemed natural to her.
HowardsEnd	51	134586	134585	134636	Henry	And [MASK] believed in it for himself. Yet, would they meet again? Are there not rather endless levels beyond the grave, as the theory that he had censured teaches? And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers?
HowardsEnd	51	134650	134619	134670	Crane	And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as hers? Thus gravely meditating, she was summoned by him. He sent up [MASK] in the motor. Other servants passed like water, but the chauffeur remained, though impertinent and disloyal.
HowardsEnd	55	134781	134733	134788	Henry	It was pitiable to see in it the stirrings of warmth that would be quenched for ever. She raked out the fire that was blazing in the kitchen, and spread the coals in the gravelled yard. She closed the windows and drew the curtains. [MASK] would probably sell the place now.
HowardsEnd	50	134872	134836	134886	Margaret	When his wife got out he said hoarsely: "I prefer to discuss things with you outside." "It will be more appropriate in the road, I am afraid," said [MASK]. "Did you get my message?" "What about?"
HowardsEnd	51	134943	134897	134948	Henry	I must tell you now that I shall make it my permanent home. Our talk last night was more important than you have realised. I am unable to forgive you and am leaving you." "I am extremely tired," said [MASK], in injured tones.
HowardsEnd	53	134994	134949	135002	Henry	"I have been walking about all the morning, and wish to sit down." "Certainly, if you will consent to sit on the grass." The Great North Road should have been bordered all its length with glebe. [MASK] s kind had filched most of it.
HowardsEnd	45	135044	135036	135081	Margaret	"Here are your keys," said [MASK]. She tossed them towards him. They fell on the sunlit slope of grass, and he did not pick them up. "I have something to tell you," he said gently.
HowardsEnd	53	135245	135244	135297	Charles	"[MASK] may go to prison. I dare not tell him. I don t know what to do--what to do. I m broken--I m ended." No sudden warmth arose in her. She did not see that to break him was her only hope.
HowardsEnd	50	135329	135308	135358	Charles	But all through that day and the next a new life began to move. The verdict was brought in. [MASK] was committed for trial. It was against all reason that he should be punished, but the law, notwithstanding, sentenced him to three years imprisonment.
HowardsEnd	55	135528	135525	135580	Tom	"Now, [MASK], baby is not to stand; he is not to lie on his face; he is not to lie so that his head wags; he is not to be teased or tickled; and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter.
HowardsEnd	44	135625	135609	135653	Helen	"He is fond of baby. That s why he does it!" was [MASK] s answer. "They re going to be lifelong friends." "Starting at the ages of six and one?" "Of course.
HowardsEnd	45	135661	135629	135674	Tom	"They re going to be lifelong friends." "Starting at the ages of six and one?" "Of course. It will be a great thing for [MASK]." "It may be a greater thing for baby."
HowardsEnd	51	135844	135835	135886	Margaret	"What can they be doing inside?" [MASK], who was growing less talkative, made no answer. The noise of the cutter came intermittently, like the breaking of waves. Close by them a man was preparing to scythe out one of the dell-holes.
HowardsEnd	48	135928	135901	135949	Margaret	"This lovely weather and to be shut up in the house! It s very hard." "It has to be," said [MASK]. "The hay fever is his chief objection against living here, but he thinks it worth while."
HowardsEnd	50	135951	135950	136000	Meg	"[MASK], is or isn t he ill? I can t make out." "Not ill. Eternally tired. He has worked very hard all his life, and noticed nothing. Those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing."
HowardsEnd	47	136023	136001	136048	Dolly	"I suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle." "Dreadfully. That is why I wish [MASK] had not come, too, to-day. Still, he wanted them all to come. It has to be."
HowardsEnd	43	136190	136180	136223	Helen	"And he likes you because you don t." [MASK] sighed. She seemed humiliated, and buried her face in her hands. After a time she said: "About love," a transition less abrupt than it appeared.
HowardsEnd	53	136224	136224	136277	Margaret	[MASK] never stopped working. "I mean a woman s love for a man. I supposed I should hang my life on to that once, and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me. But everything is peaceful now; I seem cured.
HowardsEnd	47	136432	136403	136450	Leonard	"I tempted him, and killed him, and it is surely the least I can do. I would like to throw out all my heart to [MASK] on such an afternoon as this. But I cannot. It is no good pretending.
HowardsEnd	51	136483	136440	136491	Tommy	But I cannot. It is no good pretending. I am forgetting him." Her eyes filled with tears. "How nothing seems to match--how, my darling, my precious--" She broke off. "[MASK]!" "Yes, please?"
HowardsEnd	55	136545	136531	136586	Margaret	But I--Is it some awful, appalling, criminal defect?" [MASK] silenced her. She said: "It is only that people are far more different than is pretended. All over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop.
HowardsEnd	50	136606	136566	136616	Helen	All over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop. Here and there they have the matter out, and it comforts them. Don t fret yourself, [MASK]. Develop what you have; love your child.
HowardsEnd	52	136773	136749	136801	Leonard	Don t drag in the personal when it will not come. Forget him." "Yes, yes, but what has [MASK] got out of life?" "Perhaps an adventure." "Is that enough?" "Not for us. But for him."
HowardsEnd	50	136802	136797	136847	Helen	But for him." [MASK] took up a bunch of grass. She looked at the sorrel, and the red and white and yellow clover, and the quaker grass, and the daisies, and the bents that composed it. She raised it to her face.
HowardsEnd	47	136856	136810	136857	Margaret	She looked at the sorrel, and the red and white and yellow clover, and the quaker grass, and the daisies, and the bents that composed it. She raised it to her face. "Is it sweetening yet?" asked [MASK].
HowardsEnd	46	136880	136877	136923	Meg	"Oh, [MASK], you are a person," she said. "Think of the racket and torture this time last year. But now I couldn t stop unhappy if I tried. What a change--and all through you!"
HowardsEnd	49	136934	136903	136952	Henry	But now I couldn t stop unhappy if I tried. What a change--and all through you!" "Oh, we merely settled down. You and [MASK] learnt to understand one another and to forgive, all through the autumn and the winter."
HowardsEnd	47	136990	136985	137032	Helen	"You!" cried [MASK]. "You did it all, sweetest, though you re too stupid to see. Living here was your plan--I wanted you; he wanted you; and everyone said it was impossible, but you knew.
HowardsEnd	53	137100	137061	137114	Charles	But you picked up the pieces, and made us a home. Can t it strike you--even for a moment--that your life has been heroic? Can t you remember the two months after [MASK] s arrest, when you began to act, and did all?"
HowardsEnd	53	137126	137115	137168	Margaret	"You were both ill at the time," said [MASK]. "I did the obvious things. I had two invalids to nurse. Here was a house, ready furnished and empty. It was obvious. I didn t know myself it would turn into a permanent home.
HowardsEnd	54	137203	137156	137210	Helen	I didn t know myself it would turn into a permanent home. No doubt I have done a little towards straightening the tangle, but things that I can t phrase have helped me." "I hope it will be permanent," said [MASK], drifting away to other thoughts.
HowardsEnd	52	137751	137727	137779	Margaret	The room was a little dark and airless; they were obliged to keep it like this until the carting of the hay. [MASK] joined the family without speaking; the five of them had met already at tea, and she knew quite well what was going to be said.
HowardsEnd	50	137806	137796	137846	Henry	"Is this going to suit everyone?" said [MASK] in a weary voice. He used the old phrases, but their effect was unexpected and shadowy. "Because I don t want you all coming here later on and complaining that I have been unfair."
HowardsEnd	47	137858	137812	137859	Paul	He used the old phrases, but their effect was unexpected and shadowy. "Because I don t want you all coming here later on and complaining that I have been unfair." "It s apparently got to suit us," said [MASK].
HowardsEnd	51	137886	137886	137937	Paul	[MASK] frowned ill-temperedly, and began scratching at his arm. "As I ve given up the outdoor life that suited me, and I have come home to look after the business, it s no good my settling down here," he said at last.
HowardsEnd	56	138135	138113	138169	Margaret	"And let everyone understand that; and after I am dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise." [MASK] did not answer. There was something uncanny in her triumph. She, who had never expected to conquer anyone, had charged straight through these Wilcoxes and broken up their lives.
HowardsEnd	51	138183	138140	138191	Henry	There was something uncanny in her triumph. She, who had never expected to conquer anyone, had charged straight through these Wilcoxes and broken up their lives. "In consequence, I leave my wife no money," said [MASK]. "That is her own wish.
HowardsEnd	47	138285	138243	138290	Paul	She intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years; she intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew, down in the field. Is all that clear? Does everyone understand?" [MASK] rose to his feet.
HowardsEnd	53	138759	138713	138766	Henry	"I didn t do wrong, did I?" he asked, bending down. "You didn t, darling. Nothing has been done wrong." From the garden came laughter. "Here they are at last!" exclaimed [MASK], disengaging himself with a smile.
