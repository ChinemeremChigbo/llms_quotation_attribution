ARoomWithAView	50	413	406	456	Lucy	Your mother would never forgive me, [MASK]." "She would never forgive me." The ladies' voices grew animated, and--if the sad truth be owned--a little peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled.
ARoomWithAView	49	692	644	693	George	So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: "A view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!" "This is my son," said the old man; "his name's [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	50	838	796	846	Lucy	"Why?" said the old man, with both fists on the table. "Because it is quite out of the question, thank you." "You see, we don't like to take--" began [MASK]. Her cousin again repressed her. "
ARoomWithAView	50	887	867	917	George	And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying, "[MASK], persuade them!" "It's so obvious they should have the rooms," said the son. "There's nothing else to say."
ARoomWithAView	44	1158	1158	1202	Lucy	[MASK] mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite. "Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will make a change." Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it.
ARoomWithAView	58	1239	1203	1261	Lucy	The curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for his lateness. [MASK], who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: "Oh, oh!
ARoomWithAView	56	1386	1370	1426	Lucy	But he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by [MASK]. "I AM so glad to see you," said the girl, who was in a state of spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it.
ARoomWithAView	52	1676	1669	1721	Florence	He asked the girl whether she knew [MASK] well, and was informed at some length that she had never been there before. It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the field. "Don't neglect the country round," his advice concluded.
ARoomWithAView	46	1939	1907	1953	George	That place is too sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know." The young man named [MASK] glanced at the clever lady, and then returned moodily to his plate.
ARoomWithAView	52	2282	2253	2305	Emerson	He expressed his regret. "Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner?" "[MASK]." "Is he a friend of yours?" "We are friendly--as one is in pensions."
ARoomWithAView	49	2346	2326	2375	Lucy	"I am, as it were," she concluded, "the chaperon of my young cousin, [MASK], and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing. His manner was somewhat unfortunate.
ARoomWithAView	49	2550	2528	2577	Lucy	It is so difficult--at least, I find it difficult--to understand people who speak the truth." [MASK] was pleased, and said: "I was hoping that he was nice; I do so always hope that people will be nice."
ARoomWithAView	54	2751	2747	2801	George	"I hardly know [MASK], for he hasn't learnt to talk yet. He seems a nice creature, and I think he has brains. Of course, he has all his father's mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist."
ARoomWithAView	45	2925	2918	2963	Lucy	"Why didn't you talk, [MASK]? He prefers young people, I'm sure. I do hope I haven't monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all dinner-time."
ARoomWithAView	50	2971	2936	2986	Lucy	I do hope I haven't monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all dinner-time." "He is nice," exclaimed [MASK]. "Just what I remember. He seems to see good in everyone.
ARoomWithAView	54	3537	3497	3551	Lucy	Of course, I was holding back on my cousin's account." "Of course," said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl. [MASK] tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool.
ARoomWithAView	48	3970	3950	3998	Lucy	The clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her message. "Remember, [MASK], I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the acceptance to come from you. Grant me that, at all events."
ARoomWithAView	50	4398	4376	4426	Charlotte	It is my affair." "But I would like to help you." "No, dear." [MASK]'s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself.
ARoomWithAView	48	4428	4427	4475	Lucy	So [MASK] felt, or strove to feel. And yet--there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
ARoomWithAView	49	4537	4537	4586	Lucy	[MASK] was bewildered. "If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him. I am a woman of the world, in my small way, and I know where things lead to.
ARoomWithAView	41	5932	5903	5944	Lucy	a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has its own smell." "Is it a very nice smell?" said [MASK], who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt.
ARoomWithAView	44	6127	6095	6139	Lucy	That is the true democracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you're shocked." "Indeed, I'm not!" exclaimed [MASK]. "We are Radicals, too, out and out.
ARoomWithAView	52	6218	6201	6253	Freddy	And as it is, the glass over our front door was broken last election, and [MASK] is sure it was the Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp." "Shameful! A manufacturing district, I suppose?" "No--in the Surrey hills.
ARoomWithAView	49	6944	6912	6961	Nasty	The adventure was over. "Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to them. I do detest conventional intercourse. [MASK]! they are going into the church, too. Oh, the Britisher abroad!"
ARoomWithAView	49	7170	7127	7176	Lucy	And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm. [MASK] waited for nearly ten minutes.
ARoomWithAView	51	7398	7391	7442	Giotto	Of course, it contained frescoes by [MASK], in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper. But who was to tell her which they were? She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date.
ARoomWithAView	49	8256	8229	8278	Lucy	"I'm glad it's THAT you minded. It's worth minding, the loss of a Baedeker. THAT'S worth minding." [MASK] was puzzled. She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not sure whither it would lead her.
ARoomWithAView	48	8284	8279	8327	Baedeker	"If you've no [MASK]," said the son, "you'd better join us." Was this where the idea would lead? She took refuge in her dignity. "Thank you very much, but I could not think of that.
ARoomWithAView	54	8487	8438	8492	Lucy	To take you to it will be a real pleasure." Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been furious. But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one's temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it. [MASK] could not get cross.
ARoomWithAView	54	8652	8612	8666	Giotto	She felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly. The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship [MASK], not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.
ARoomWithAView	56	8709	8707	8763	Giotto	Observe how [MASK] in these frescoes--now, unhappily, ruined by restoration--is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective. Could anything be more majestic, more pathetic, beautiful, true? How little, we feel, avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!"
ARoomWithAView	47	8882	8874	8921	Lucy	The audience shifted uneasily, and so did [MASK]. She was sure that she ought not to be with these men; but they had cast a spell over her. They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave.
ARoomWithAView	47	8939	8906	8953	George	They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave. "Now, did this happen, or didn't it? Yes or no?" [MASK] replied: "It happened like this, if it happened at all.
ARoomWithAView	46	9307	9262	9308	George	Why did he go? Did we talk too loud? How vexatious. I shall go and say we are sorry. Hadn't I better? Then perhaps he will come back." "He will not come back," said [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	52	9327	9327	9379	Lucy	[MASK], apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent. The son, who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.
ARoomWithAView	46	9460	9452	9498	Lucy	"How silly of them!" said [MASK], though in her heart she sympathized; "I think that a kind action done tactfully--" "Tact!" He threw up his head in disdain. Apparently she had given the wrong answer.
ARoomWithAView	50	9903	9888	9938	Giotto	he said uneasily. "I saw nothing in it." "I like [MASK]," she replied. "It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values. Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better." "So you ought.
ARoomWithAView	49	10114	10070	10119	Charlotte	She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old man, as well as a very irreligious one. She also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that [MASK] would object most strongly.
ARoomWithAView	50	10176	10168	10218	Lucy	Eh? What did you say?" [MASK] had made no suggestion. Suddenly he said: "Now don't be stupid over this. I don't require you to fall in love with my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him.
ARoomWithAView	50	10318	10285	10335	George	Let yourself go. Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand, and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them. By understanding [MASK] you may learn to understand yourself. It will be good for both of you."
ARoomWithAView	50	10372	10345	10395	Lucy	"I only know what it is that's wrong with him; not why it is." "And what is it?" asked [MASK] fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale. "The old trouble; things won't fit." "What things?"
ARoomWithAView	49	10474	10425	10474	George	In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry, he said: "'From far, from eve and morning, And yon twelve-winded sky, The stuff of life to knit me Blew hither: here am I' [MASK]
ARoomWithAView	41	10796	10756	10797	Baedeker	Indeed, he no longer alarmed her at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly. Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically, before she lost [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	42	11039	11035	11077	Lucy	It so happened that [MASK], who found daily life rather chaotic, entered a more solid world when she opened the piano. She was then no longer either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.
ARoomWithAView	51	11745	11734	11785	Beethoven	I do not consider her choice of a piece happy. [MASK] is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if anything, disturbs." "Introduce me." "She will be delighted.
ARoomWithAView	49	12092	12050	12099	Lucy	She has never got over it. Of course, I didn't mean that I played well; I only meant--" "Of course," said he, wondering why she bothered to explain. "Music--" said [MASK], as if attempting some generality.
ARoomWithAView	58	13323	13266	13324	Lucy	Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose. She took to it, practically in despair, after her life's work was carried away in a landslip. Surely that makes it more excusable." "What was that?" asked [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	50	13427	13423	13473	Italians	But you know what [MASK] are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written. The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted into cigarettes.
ARoomWithAView	50	14105	14069	14119	S.	I honour the woman for her Irish visit.' The woman! I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on account of [MASK] having been mentioned in the first place. But that was not all.
ARoomWithAView	42	14281	14251	14293	Lucy	She went. At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience." "Whatever happened?" cried [MASK]. "No one knows. No one will ever know.
ARoomWithAView	51	14699	14653	14704	Lucy	This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl: he would rather it should fail. After all, he knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are flimsy things; whereas [MASK] would be his parishioner.
ARoomWithAView	49	14769	14742	14791	Charlotte	"But aren't they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?" said the little lady inquisitively. "Only once. [MASK] didn't like it, and said something--quite politely, of course." "Most right of her.
ARoomWithAView	59	14867	14816	14875	Lucy	They had given up their attempt--if it was one--to conquer society, and now the father was almost as silent as the son. He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left--some expedition, perhaps, with [MASK] well chaperoned to be nice to them.
ARoomWithAView	46	14998	14980	15026	Lucy	"All the galleries are shut." "I think I shall go out," said [MASK]. "I want to go round the town in the circular tram--on the platform by the driver." Her two companions looked grave.
ARoomWithAView	51	15266	15253	15304	Charlotte	It was unladylike. Why? Why were most big things unladylike? [MASK] had once explained to her why. It was not that ladies were inferior to men; it was that they were different. Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.
ARoomWithAView	51	15305	15291	15342	Indirectly	Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves. [MASK], by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much. But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured, then despised, and finally ignored.
ARoomWithAView	52	15566	15540	15592	Lucy	Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self. [MASK] does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious.
ARoomWithAView	47	15926	15909	15956	Neptune	The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to strike it. [MASK] was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge.
ARoomWithAView	46	17198	17162	17208	Lucy	Then the boy verged into a man. "For something tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting muddled. It isn't exactly that a man has died." Something warned [MASK] that she must stop him. "It has happened
ARoomWithAView	54	18606	18589	18643	Lucy	Now, you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning." [MASK] poked at the ground with her parasol. "But perhaps you would rather not?" "I'm sorry--if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not."
ARoomWithAView	43	19496	19487	19530	Baedekers	He knew the people who never walked about with [MASK], who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of, and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.
ARoomWithAView	49	20051	20027	20076	Lucy	I trust that neither of you was at all--that it was not in your immediate proximity?" Of the many things [MASK] was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood.
ARoomWithAView	57	20335	20332	20389	Lucy	He appealed to [MASK]; would not she intercede? He was poor--he sheltered a family--the tax on bread. He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied, he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.
ARoomWithAView	51	21089	21078	21129	Lucy	I will say no more." For the first time [MASK]'s rebellious thoughts swept out in words--for the first time in her life. "You have said very little." "It was my intention to say very little," was his frigid reply.
ARoomWithAView	51	21285	21247	21298	Lucy	"Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you. But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them." "I'm not defending them," said [MASK], losing her courage, and relapsing into the old chaotic methods.
ARoomWithAView	49	21976	21965	22014	Eleanor	You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and [MASK] will follow behind. A one-horse carriage would do for us. Yet how difficult it is!" "It is indeed," replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded sympathetic.
ARoomWithAView	53	22780	22777	22830	Eager	To her Mr. [MASK] objected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard against imposition. But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god.
ARoomWithAView	52	22831	22801	22853	Phaethon	But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god. [MASK] at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist.
ARoomWithAView	51	23955	23939	23990	Lucy	During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully. [MASK] had a spasm of envy. Granted that they wished to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so. They were probably the only people enjoying the expedition.
ARoomWithAView	51	24774	24772	24823	Lucy	He commanded [MASK] to agree with him; he shouted for support to his son. "We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money. He has bargained to drive us, and he is doing it. We have no rights over his soul."
ARoomWithAView	52	26561	26538	26590	Spring	In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct. For the first time she felt the influence of [MASK]. His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other things, existed in great profusion there; "would she like to see them?"
ARoomWithAView	54	26767	26715	26769	Eccolo	He shrugged his shoulders. An Italian's ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge. She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen. The view was forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other hills. "[MASK]!"
ARoomWithAView	59	27386	27340	27399	Lucy	He alone had played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had used scraps of their intelligence. He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be. He alone had interpreted the message that [MASK] had received five days before from the lips of a dying man.
ARoomWithAView	50	27400	27400	27450	Persephone	[MASK], who spends half her life in the grave--she could interpret it also. Not so these English. They gain knowledge slowly, and perhaps too late. The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of his employers.
ARoomWithAView	52	27759	27748	27800	Lucy	Courage--courage and faith." Under the rug, [MASK] felt the kindly pressure of her cousin's hand. At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards.
ARoomWithAView	53	27986	27941	27994	Lucy	"He may be killed!" "Typical behaviour," said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage. "In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down." "What does he know?" whispered [MASK] as soon as they were alone. "
ARoomWithAView	47	28105	28076	28123	Lucy	and offered him a franc. "Va bene," he replied, and accepted it. As well this ending to his day as any. But [MASK], a mortal maid, was disappointed in him. There was an explosion up the road.
ARoomWithAView	52	28598	28570	28622	Lucy	Indeed, she had little more to learn. With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her. All the way back [MASK]'s body was shaken by deep sighs, which nothing could repress. "I want to be truthful," she whispered.
ARoomWithAView	54	28905	28858	28912	Lucy	Music seemed to her the employment of a child. She sat close to her cousin, who, with commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage. When it was over she capped it by a story of her own. [MASK] became rather hysterical with the delay.
ARoomWithAView	45	29124	29115	29160	Lucy	A tram roared by in the dark, and [MASK] felt unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes. She lifted them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague, the very ghosts of joy.
ARoomWithAView	42	29380	29375	29417	Lucy	"Yes," said [MASK], whom at the time the argument had pleased. "Well, I am no prude. There is no need to call him a wicked young man, but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined.
ARoomWithAView	47	29456	29444	29491	Lucy	What do you propose to do?" An idea rushed across [MASK]'s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her, might have proved victorious. "I propose to speak to him," said she.
ARoomWithAView	51	29505	29501	29552	Charlotte	"You see, [MASK], your kindness--I shall never forget it. But--as you said--it is my affair. Mine and his." "And you are going to IMPLORE him, to BEG him to keep silence?" "Certainly not.
ARoomWithAView	52	29713	29705	29757	Lucy	"I can't think," said [MASK] again. "When he insulted you, how would you have replied?" "I hadn't time to think. You came." "Yes, but won't you tell me now what you would have done?"
ARoomWithAView	50	29863	29825	29875	George	She was in her cousin's power. She could not modulate out the key of self-abasement in which she had started. Neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to [MASK] and settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.
ARoomWithAView	45	30158	30124	30169	Charlotte	Isn't afternoon tea given there for nothing?" "Yes, but they pay extra for wine." After this remark she remained motionless and silent. To her tired eyes [MASK] throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream.
ARoomWithAView	59	30227	30227	30286	Charlotte	[MASK], who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk, vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size. She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.
ARoomWithAView	52	30471	30455	30507	Charlotte	Her emotion relaxed, she modified her embrace a little, and she said: "[MASK] dear, what do you mean? As if I have anything to forgive!" "You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself, too.
ARoomWithAView	52	30875	30875	30927	Lucy	[MASK], from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said: "Why need mother hear of it?" "But you tell her everything?" "I suppose I do generally." "I dare not break your confidence. There is something sacred in it.
ARoomWithAView	53	31232	31232	31285	Lucy	[MASK] was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity, of her craving for sympathy and love. Such a wrong is not easily forgotten. Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff.
ARoomWithAView	48	31482	31465	31513	Lucy	His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her work. [MASK] cried aloud: "It isn't true. It can't all be true. I want not to be muddled. I want to grow older quickly."
ARoomWithAView	44	31852	31852	31896	Freddy	[MASK] did not move or reply. "I think things are coming to a head," she observed, rather wanting her son's opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication. "Time they did."
ARoomWithAView	51	31902	31859	31910	Cecil	"I think things are coming to a head," she observed, rather wanting her son's opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication. "Time they did." "I am glad that [MASK] is asking her this once more."
ARoomWithAView	51	32118	32105	32156	Cecil	But--'" She stopped reading, "I was rather amused at [MASK] asking my permission at all. He has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so forth. When it comes to the point, he can't get on without me."
ARoomWithAView	50	32166	32157	32207	Freddy	"Nor me." "You?" [MASK] nodded. "What do you mean?" "He asked me for my permission also." She exclaimed: "How very odd of him!" "Why so?" asked the son and heir.
ARoomWithAView	50	32224	32186	32236	Lucy	She exclaimed: "How very odd of him!" "Why so?" asked the son and heir. "Why shouldn't my permission be asked?" "What do you know about [MASK] or girls or anything? What ever did you say?"
ARoomWithAView	47	32241	32237	32284	Cecil	"I said to [MASK], 'Take her or leave her; it's no business of mine!'" "What a helpful answer!" But her own answer, though more normal in its wording, had been to the same effect.
ARoomWithAView	45	32293	32266	32311	Freddy	But her own answer, though more normal in its wording, had been to the same effect. "The bother is this," began [MASK]. Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.
ARoomWithAView	42	32321	32320	32362	Freddy	"[MASK], you must come. There they still are!" "I don't see you ought to go peeping like that." "Peeping like that! Can't I look out of my own window?"
ARoomWithAView	50	32386	32352	32402	Freddy	Can't I look out of my own window?" But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her son, "Still page 322?" [MASK] snorted, and turned over two leaves. For a brief space they were silent.
ARoomWithAView	50	32435	32395	32445	Cecil	For a brief space they were silent. Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased. "The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with [MASK] most awfully." He gave a nervous gulp.
ARoomWithAView	51	32628	32594	32645	Cecil	"Ridiculous child!" cried his mother. "You think you're so holy and truthful, but really it's only abominable conceit. Do you suppose that a man like [MASK] would take the slightest notice of anything you say? I hope he boxed your ears.
ARoomWithAView	51	32691	32662	32713	Cecil	I had to say no when I couldn't say yes. I tried to laugh as if I didn't mean what I said, and, as [MASK] laughed too, and went away, it may be all right. But I feel my foot's in it.
ARoomWithAView	50	32835	32794	32844	Lucy	"Not a bit!" he pleaded. "I only let out I didn't like him. I don't hate him, but I don't like him. What I mind is that he'll tell [MASK]." He glanced at the curtains dismally.
ARoomWithAView	46	33471	33426	33472	Freddy	No, I'll cross that last bit out--it looks patronizing. I'll stop at 'because she tells me everything.' Or shall I cross that out, too?" "Cross it out, too," said [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	55	33884	33881	33936	Cecil	she exclaimed--"oh, [MASK], do tell me!" "I promessi sposi," said he. They stared at him anxiously. "She has accepted me," he said, and the sound of the thing in English made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.
ARoomWithAView	49	34133	34133	34182	Lucy	[MASK] rose from the seat. She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis. Then she saw her brother's face. Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms.
ARoomWithAView	44	34203	34163	34207	Lucy	Then she saw her brother's face. Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms. He said, "Steady on!" "Not a kiss for me?" asked her mother. [MASK] kissed her also.
ARoomWithAView	51	34985	34960	35011	Lucy	It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win [MASK]; he wanted to feel that others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their permission.
ARoomWithAView	47	35287	35260	35307	Cecil	"I've come for tea and for gossip. Isn't this news?" "News? I don't understand you," said [MASK]. "News?" Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.
ARoomWithAView	42	35351	35344	35386	Cecil	"Has he indeed?" said [MASK], trying to recover himself. Into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen! Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant?
ARoomWithAView	48	35591	35583	35631	Cecil	"I have no profession," said [MASK]. "It is another example of my decadence. My attitude--quite an indefensible one--is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like.
ARoomWithAView	44	35972	35956	36000	Euphemia	She leaves the dust-pans standing on the stairs." "The fault of [MASK] is that she will not, simply will not, chop the suet sufficiently small." They both laughed, and things began to go better.
ARoomWithAView	47	36162	36121	36168	Cecil	The water-tight compartments in her will break down, and music and life will mingle. Then we shall have her heroically good, heroically bad--too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad." [MASK] found his companion interesting. "
ARoomWithAView	53	36275	36269	36322	Conversation	"In what way?" [MASK] had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and down the terrace. "I could as easily tell you what tune she'll play next. There was simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them.
ARoomWithAView	51	36499	36487	36538	Cecil	What do you mean?" "I meant," said [MASK] stiffly, "that she is going to marry me." The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice. "I am sorry; I must apologize.
ARoomWithAView	52	36588	36588	36640	Cecil	[MASK], who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down his mouth at the corners. Was this the reception his action would get from the world? Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement.
ARoomWithAView	51	36682	36641	36692	Lucy	But he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered. Occasionally he could be quite crude. "I am sorry I have given you a shock," he said dryly. "I fear that [MASK]'s choice does not meet with your approval."
ARoomWithAView	49	36792	36769	36818	Florence	He was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession. "No, I have said nothing indiscreet. I foresaw at [MASK] that her quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended. I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step.
ARoomWithAView	50	36933	36890	36940	Cecil	"She has learnt through you," and if his voice was still clerical, it was now also sincere; "let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her." "Grazie tante!" said [MASK], who did not like parsons.
ARoomWithAView	47	37654	37647	37694	Cecil	They were gone some time, and [MASK] was left with the dowagers. When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been. "Do you go to much of this sort of thing?" he asked when they were driving home.
ARoomWithAView	50	37704	37661	37711	Lucy	When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been. "Do you go to much of this sort of thing?" he asked when they were driving home. "Oh, now and then," said [MASK], who had rather enjoyed herself.
ARoomWithAView	57	38064	38063	38120	Cecil	But [MASK], since his engagement, had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing. "Well," said he, "I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me. There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must accept them."
ARoomWithAView	48	38329	38295	38343	Lucy	The rest of the pattern is the other people. Motives are all very well, but the fence comes here." "We weren't talking of real fences," said [MASK], laughing. "Oh, I see, dear--poetry."
ARoomWithAView	48	38607	38576	38624	Cecil	"Perhaps he had." "No!" "Why 'no'?" "He was such a nice old man, I'm sure." [MASK] laughed at her feminine inconsequence. "Well, I did try to sift the thing.
ARoomWithAView	45	39227	39227	39272	Lucy	[MASK] had not attended either. Her brow was wrinkled, and she still looked furiously cross--the result, he concluded, of too much moral gymnastics. It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood.
ARoomWithAView	56	39567	39528	39584	Albert	These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals. "[MASK]" was inhabited. His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells.
ARoomWithAView	50	39596	39572	39622	Cissie	His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells. His little windows were chastely swathed in Nottingham lace. "[MASK]" was to let. Three notice-boards, belonging to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact.
ARoomWithAView	53	39828	39777	39830	Cecil	Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew's time?" "But what can I do?" He lowered his voice. "An old lady, so very vulgar, and almost bedridden." "Turn her out," said [MASK] bravely.
ARoomWithAView	50	40338	40289	40339	Lucy	It will attract the wrong type of people. The train service has improved--a fatal improvement, to my mind. And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles?" "Rather a strenuous clerk it would be," said [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	45	40340	40340	40385	Cecil	[MASK], who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate. She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.
ARoomWithAView	49	40410	40391	40440	Lucy	she exclaimed, "I have an idea. How would you like spinsters?" "My dear [MASK], it would be splendid. Do you know any such?" "Yes; I met them abroad." "Gentlewomen?" he asked tentatively.
ARoomWithAView	52	40643	40596	40648	Lucy	And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory--people swindlers, or not respectable. And oh, the deceit! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week. The deceit of the most promising people. My dear [MASK], the deceit!"
ARoomWithAView	41	41197	41165	41206	Cecil	He beamed at them knowingly, said, "Aha! young people, young people!" and then hastened to unlock the house. "Hopeless vulgarian!" exclaimed [MASK], almost before they were out of earshot.
ARoomWithAView	46	41247	41213	41259	Lucy	"I can't help it. It would be wrong not to loathe that man." "He isn't clever, but really he is nice." "No, [MASK], he stands for all that is bad in country life.
ARoomWithAView	50	41329	41285	41335	Lucy	But down here he acts the little god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and everyone--even your mother--is taken in." "All that you say is quite true," said [MASK], though she felt discouraged.
ARoomWithAView	51	41419	41374	41425	Lucy	How I do hope he'll get some vulgar tenant in that villa--some woman so really vulgar that he'll notice it. GENTLEFOLKS! Ugh! with his bald head and retreating chin! But let's forget him." This [MASK] was glad enough to do.
ARoomWithAView	49	41627	41593	41642	Cecil	"Are there two ways?" "Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we're got up smart." "I'd rather go through the wood," said [MASK], With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon.
ARoomWithAView	41	41648	41643	41684	Lucy	"Why is it, [MASK], that you always say the road? Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?" "Haven't I?
ARoomWithAView	50	41988	41945	41995	Cecil	" "Yes, with no view, I fancy. Why not?" "I'd rather," he said reproachfully, "that you connected me with the open air." She said again, "Oh, [MASK], whatever do you mean?"
ARoomWithAView	49	42200	42169	42218	Freddy	Well, a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains, and can't get away at once, and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful. Then [MASK] used to bathe there. He is very fond of it." "And you?"
ARoomWithAView	50	42351	42306	42356	Charlotte	She was got up smart, as she phrased it, and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green. "Who found you out?" "[MASK]," she murmured.
ARoomWithAView	43	42394	42369	42412	Lucy	"Poor girl!" She smiled gravely. A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk, now appeared practical. "[MASK]!" "Yes, I suppose we ought to be going," was her reply.
ARoomWithAView	48	42414	42397	42445	Lucy	"Yes, I suppose we ought to be going," was her reply. "[MASK], I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before." At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him.
ARoomWithAView	48	42449	42446	42494	Cecil	"What, [MASK]?" "Hitherto never--not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me--" He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed. His courage had gone. "Yes?"
ARoomWithAView	51	42549	42531	42582	Cecil	"Then I ask you--may I now?" "Of course, you may, [MASK]. You might before. I can't run at you, you know." At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities. Her reply was inadequate.
ARoomWithAView	48	42713	42708	42756	Lucy	He recast the scene. [MASK] was standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness. For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.
ARoomWithAView	53	43429	43409	43462	Lucy	he rebelled, and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad. He did not realize that [MASK] had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely.
ARoomWithAView	43	43769	43737	43780	Lucy	"Just because they're old and silly one's expected to say 'How sweet!' I hate their 'if'-ing and 'but'-ing and 'and'-ing. And poor [MASK]--serve her right--worn to a shadow."
ARoomWithAView	47	44114	44110	44157	Cecil	Up in the house [MASK] heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not come down to impart it, in case he got hurt. He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man.
ARoomWithAView	45	44272	44237	44282	Lucy	"That wasn't the name--" Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass. An interval elapses. "Wasn't what name?" asked [MASK], with her brother's head in her lap.
ARoomWithAView	50	44330	44322	44372	Honeychurch,'"--Freddy	He said to me: 'Ahem! [MASK] was an indifferent mimic--"'ahem! ahem! I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.' I said, 'ooray, old boy!' and slapped him on the back." "Exactly.
ARoomWithAView	45	44653	44624	44669	Emersons	Like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of [MASK] annoyed him beyond measure. "I trust they are the right sort of person.
ARoomWithAView	54	44673	44659	44713	Lucy"--she	"I trust they are the right sort of person. All right, [MASK] was sitting up again--"I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother's a snob. But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it's affectation to pretend there isn't."
ARoomWithAView	49	44826	44795	44844	Cecil	Pray, does that satisfy you?" "Oh, yes," he grumbled. "And you will be satisfied, too, for they're friends of [MASK]; so"--elaborate irony--"you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety."
ARoomWithAView	48	45031	45025	45073	Cecil	When she exclaimed, "But [MASK]'s Emersons--they can't possibly be the same ones--there is that--" he did not consider that the exclamation was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure.
ARoomWithAView	47	45618	45594	45641	Harris	Don't be silly. You always overdo it when you play." As she left them her mother's shout of "[MASK]!" shivered the tranquil air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right.
ARoomWithAView	56	45663	45642	45698	Cecil	Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons, friends of [MASK]'s, with a pair of nondescript tourists. Hitherto truth had come to her naturally. She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be--absolutely truthful?
ARoomWithAView	52	45725	45681	45733	Cecil	She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be--absolutely truthful? Well, at all events, she must not tell lies. She hurried up the garden, still flushed with shame. A word from [MASK] would soothe her, she was sure.
ARoomWithAView	46	45739	45738	45784	Hullo	"[MASK]!" he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window. He seemed in high spirits. "I was hoping you'd come. I heard you all bear-gardening, but there's better fun up here.
ARoomWithAView	49	45884	45839	45888	Freddy	Don't be angry! You'll forgive me when you hear it all." He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once. "I have heard," she said. "[MASK] has told us.
ARoomWithAView	53	45951	45929	45982	Lucy	But you oughtn't to tease one so." "Friends of mine?" he laughed. "But, [MASK], the whole joke is to come! Come here." But she remained standing where she was. "Do you know where I met these desirable tenants?
ARoomWithAView	55	46217	46205	46260	Lucy	I meant to read him a lesson some time. No, [MASK], the classes ought to mix, and before long you'll agree with me. There ought to be intermarriage--all sorts of things. I believe in democracy--" "No, you don't," she snapped.
ARoomWithAView	50	46286	46245	46295	Leonardesque	I believe in democracy--" "No, you don't," she snapped. "You don't know what the word means." He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be [MASK]. "No, you don't!"
ARoomWithAView	48	46809	46799	46847	Lucy	He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in [MASK]. At last she longed for attention, as a woman should, and looked up to him because he was a man. "So you do love me, little thing?" he murmured.
ARoomWithAView	47	46851	46811	46858	Cecil	At last she longed for attention, as a woman should, and looked up to him because he was a man. "So you do love me, little thing?" he murmured. "Oh, [MASK], I do, I do!
ARoomWithAView	50	47499	47462	47512	Cecil	I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again. As for the son, I am sorry for him when we meet, rather than for myself. They are known to [MASK], who is very well and spoke of you the other day.
ARoomWithAView	58	48128	48094	48152	Cecil	The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her abilities, and even with [MASK] she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.
ARoomWithAView	54	48155	48129	48183	Lucy	she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd. "Make [MASK] one of us," she said, looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.
ARoomWithAView	56	48185	48184	48240	Lucy	"[MASK] is becoming wonderful--wonderful." "Her music always was wonderful." "Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent Honeychurches, but you know what I mean. She is not always quoting servants, or asking one how the pudding is made."
ARoomWithAView	48	48540	48504	48552	Lucy	The elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: "You should have heard us talking about you, dear. He admires you more than ever. Dream of that." [MASK] returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand.
ARoomWithAView	44	48704	48693	48737	Freddy	"M'm." "They might amuse you." [MASK], whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just moved in.
ARoomWithAView	45	48868	48850	48895	Freddy	The sitting-room itself was blocked with books. "Are these people great readers?" [MASK] whispered. "Are they that sort?" "I fancy they know how to read--a rare accomplishment. What have they got?
ARoomWithAView	47	48896	48872	48919	Byron	Are they that sort?" "I fancy they know how to read--a rare accomplishment. What have they got? [MASK]. Exactly. A Shropshire Lad. Never heard of it. The Way of All Flesh. Never heard of it.
ARoomWithAView	49	49039	49008	49057	Freddy	I like that. I'm certain that's the old man's doing." "How very odd of him!" "Surely you agree?" But [MASK] was his mother's son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture.
ARoomWithAView	51	49180	49179	49230	Lucy	"[MASK] used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it'll be very different now, mother thinks. She will read all kinds of books." "So will you." "Only medical books. Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
ARoomWithAView	46	49623	49599	49645	Freddy	But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden." "I say, what about this bathe?" murmured [MASK], appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him. "I believed in a return to Nature once.
ARoomWithAView	44	49836	49794	49838	Honeychurch	I have met so few Liberal landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude. Ah, this wind! You do well to bathe. Yours is a glorious country, [MASK]!"
ARoomWithAView	54	49846	49839	49893	Freddy	"Not a bit!" mumbled [MASK]. "I must--that is to say, I have to--have the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope." "CALL, my lad? Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle?
ARoomWithAView	50	49996	49947	49997	George	I trust that you have realized about the ten days' interval. It does not count that I helped you with the stair-eyes yesterday. It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon." "Yes, go and bathe, [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	46	50026	49998	50044	George	Why do you dawdle talking? Bring them back to tea. Bring back some milk, cakes, honey. The change will do you good. [MASK] has been working very hard at his office. I can't believe he's well."
ARoomWithAView	47	50074	50065	50112	Freddy	"Do you really want this bathe?" [MASK] asked him. "It is only a pond, don't you know. I dare say you are used to something better." "Yes--I have said 'Yes' already."
ARoomWithAView	50	50353	50311	50361	George	"Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we suppose. For example, it isn't purely coincidentally that you are here now, when one comes to reflect." To his relief, [MASK] began to talk. "It is.
ARoomWithAView	44	50622	50601	50645	Silence	"And so for this and for other reasons my 'History of Coincidence' is still to write." [MASK]. Wishing to round off the episode, he added; "We are all so glad that you have come."
ARoomWithAView	52	50789	50789	50841	George	[MASK] sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his boots. "Aren't those masses of willow-herb splendid? I love willow-herb in seed. What's the name of this aromatic plant?" No one knew, or seemed to care.
ARoomWithAView	48	50945	50932	50980	Freddy	Wetting his hair first--a sure sign of apathy--he followed [MASK] into the divine, as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds. It was necessary to use his muscles. It was necessary to keep clean.
ARoomWithAView	55	51372	51366	51421	George	A little deferentially, they splashed [MASK]. He was quiet: they feared they had offended him. Then all the forces of youth burst out. He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.
ARoomWithAView	50	51487	51471	51521	Indians	They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being [MASK] in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get clean. And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward, proclaiming: "No.
ARoomWithAView	53	52019	51981	52034	Freddy	They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions. "Well, I can't help it," said a voice close ahead, and [MASK] reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds.
ARoomWithAView	52	52126	52080	52132	Lucy	"Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow's got to dry, and if another fellow--" "Dear, no doubt you're right as usual, but you are in no position to argue. Come, [MASK]." They turned. "
ARoomWithAView	44	52224	52191	52235	Emerson	"And me, I've swallowed one," answered he of the bracken. "I've swallowed a pollywog. It wriggleth in my tummy. I shall die--[MASK] you beast, you've got on my bags."
ARoomWithAView	54	52476	52448	52502	George	But she had always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which surely we have a right to assume. Who could foretell that she and [MASK] would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth?
ARoomWithAView	54	52695	52642	52696	Cecil	That will be just the proper thing." She had bowed--but to whom? To gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls! She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world. So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	53	52776	52741	52794	Lucy	He did not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and made long, clever answers where "Yes" or "No" would have done. [MASK] soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace.
ARoomWithAView	55	52966	52965	53020	Cecil	"[MASK] has told you to think so. You were devoted to her as a little girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever. No--it is just the same thing everywhere." "Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?"
ARoomWithAView	43	53148	53121	53164	Cecil	"Not in that way. At times I could wring her neck. But not in that way. No. It is the same with [MASK] all over." "By-the-by--I never told you.
ARoomWithAView	41	53263	53226	53267	Cecil	No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture; your father bought it and we must put up with it, will [MASK] kindly remember."
ARoomWithAView	52	53279	53268	53320	Cecil	"I--I see what you mean, and certainly [MASK] oughtn't to. But he does not mean to be uncivil--he once explained--it is the things that upset him--he is easily upset by ugly things--he is not uncivil to PEOPLE."
ARoomWithAView	49	53330	53284	53333	Freddy	But he does not mean to be uncivil--he once explained--it is the things that upset him--he is easily upset by ugly things--he is not uncivil to PEOPLE." "Is it a thing or a person when [MASK] sings?"
ARoomWithAView	52	53385	53334	53386	Lucy	"You can't expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do." "Then why didn't he leave the room? Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone's pleasure?" "We mustn't be unjust to people," faltered [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	49	53537	53536	53585	Lucy	And [MASK]--she knew not why--wished that the trouble could have come at any other time. "Go and dress, dear; you'll be late." "All right, mother--" "Don't say 'All right' and stop.
ARoomWithAView	54	53724	53694	53748	Freddy	She must be more careful; her mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was about. Oh, dear, what should she do?--and then [MASK] came bounding upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved. "I say, those are topping people."
ARoomWithAView	46	53851	53842	53888	Freddy	"Oh, I wouldn't do that, [MASK], I wouldn't do that with all this muddle." "What's wrong with the court? They won't mind a bump or two, and I've ordered new balls."
ARoomWithAView	44	54053	54052	54096	Charlotte	Did [MASK] mention her boiler?" "Her WHAT?" "Don't you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and her bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?"
ARoomWithAView	52	54234	54207	54259	Cecil	At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil. [MASK] despised their methods--perhaps rightly. At all events, they were not his own. Dinner was at half-past seven.
ARoomWithAView	47	54260	54242	54289	Freddy	At all events, they were not his own. Dinner was at half-past seven. [MASK] gabbled the grace, and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to. Fortunately, the men were hungry. Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding.
ARoomWithAView	45	54830	54792	54837	Cecil	" "Then, depend upon it, it IS the boiler. I know myself how water preys upon one's mind. I would rather anything else--even a misfortune with the meat." [MASK] laid his hand over his eyes.
ARoomWithAView	48	55131	55092	55140	Charlotte	"I don't want to make difficulties, but it really isn't fair on the maids to fill up the house so." Alas! "The truth is, dear, you don't like [MASK]." "No, I don't.
ARoomWithAView	56	55145	55141	55197	Cecil	And no more does [MASK]. She gets on our nerves. You haven't seen her lately, and don't realize how tiresome she can be, though so good. So please, mother, don't worry us this last summer; but spoil us by not asking her to come."
ARoomWithAView	53	55205	55153	55206	Cecil	You haven't seen her lately, and don't realize how tiresome she can be, though so good. So please, mother, don't worry us this last summer; but spoil us by not asking her to come." "Hear, hear!" said [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	58	55375	55331	55389	Lucy	She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right." "I know, dear. She is kind to everyone, and yet [MASK] makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return."
ARoomWithAView	42	55459	55440	55482	Charlotte	She was reduced to saying: "I can't help it, mother. I don't like [MASK]. I admit it's horrid of me." "From your own account, you told her as much."
ARoomWithAView	50	55614	55601	55651	Freddy	"I didn't mean the egg was WELL boiled," corrected [MASK], "because in point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I don't care for eggs. I only meant how jolly kind she seemed."
ARoomWithAView	51	55680	55656	55707	Lucy	Oh, these Honeychurches! Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas, maids--of such were their lives compact. "May me and [MASK] get down from our chairs?" he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence. "We don't want no dessert." Chapter XIV:
ARoomWithAView	43	55776	55776	55819	Lucy	[MASK] faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only faced the situation that encompassed her. She never gazed inwards. If at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
ARoomWithAView	45	55859	55849	55894	George	She was nervous at night. When she talked to [MASK]--they met again almost immediately at the Rectory--his voice moved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him. How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him!
ARoomWithAView	45	55937	55915	55960	Cecil	Once she had suffered from "things that came out of nothing and meant she didn't know what." Now [MASK] had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed.
ARoomWithAView	45	56139	56127	56172	Lucy	I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully." [MASK] said, "He seems in better spirits. He laughs more." "Yes," replied the clergyman. "He is waking up." That was all.
ARoomWithAView	53	56533	56520	56573	Lucy	"Let's leave it all till mother comes back," suggested [MASK]. "No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me. We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt settling of accounts."
ARoomWithAView	51	56915	56870	56921	Freddy	"Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see." "But I don't see--" They tried to stifle her with cake. "No, thank you. I'm done. I don't see why--[MASK], don't poke me.
ARoomWithAView	50	57029	56985	57035	Cecil	"Thank you, dear, for reminding me. A shilling was it? Can any one give me change for half a crown?" "I'll get it," said the young hostess, rising with decision. "[MASK], give me that sovereign.
ARoomWithAView	45	57130	57121	57166	Lucy	"No, I haven't," replied [MASK], and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant. "Let me see--a sovereign's worth of silver." She escaped into the kitchen.
ARoomWithAView	54	57218	57176	57230	Cecil	It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul. "No, I haven't told [MASK] or any one," she remarked, when she returned.
ARoomWithAView	47	57381	57354	57401	Lucy	"For instance, the driver. I saw him looking through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth." [MASK] shuddered a little. "We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren't careful.
ARoomWithAView	47	57413	57386	57433	Cecil	"We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren't careful. How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of [MASK]?" "We must think of every possibility." "Oh, it's all right."
ARoomWithAView	48	57484	57442	57490	Cecil	In fact, he is certain to know." "I don't care if he does. I was grateful to you for your letter, but even if the news does get round, I think I can trust [MASK] to laugh at it."
ARoomWithAView	49	57557	57548	57597	Charlotte	Ladies are certainly different." "Now, [MASK]!" She struck at her playfully. "You kind, anxious thing. What WOULD you have me do? First you say 'Don't tell'; and then you say, 'Tell'.
ARoomWithAView	50	57689	57681	57731	Minnie	For the air rang with the shrieks of [MASK], who was being scalped with a teaspoon. "Dear, one moment--we may not have this chance for a chat again. Have you seen the young one yet?" "Yes, I have."
ARoomWithAView	52	57809	57768	57820	Charlotte	It is really all right. What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it bluntly? I do wish I could make you see it my way. He really won't be any nuisance, [MASK]." "Once a cad, always a cad.
ARoomWithAView	55	57931	57923	57978	Emerson	"What I mean by subconscious is that [MASK] lost his head. I fell into all those violets, and he was silly and surprised. I don't think we ought to blame him very much. It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly.
ARoomWithAView	51	58010	57979	58030	Freddy	It really does; it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn't admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw. [MASK] rather likes him, and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself.
ARoomWithAView	46	58216	58189	58235	Lucy	She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess. Explanations took place, and in the midst of them [MASK] escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain. Chapter XV: The Disaster Within
ARoomWithAView	53	58657	58609	58662	Apollo	She frowns a little--not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry. In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between [MASK] and the western hills.
ARoomWithAView	48	58699	58673	58721	Cecil	Who's been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil?" "It's only the library book that [MASK]'s been reading." "But pick it up, and don't stand idling there like a flamingo."
ARoomWithAView	52	58758	58738	58790	Cecil	She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching [MASK] up. It was dreadful how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it.
ARoomWithAView	50	58916	58872	58922	Minnie	She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster. "It's a special collection--I forget what for. I do beg, no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that [MASK] has a nice bright sixpence.
ARoomWithAView	42	58991	58975	59017	Charlotte	Here comes the horse"--it was always the horse, never the carriage. "Where's [MASK]? Run up and hurry her. Why is she so long? She had nothing to do. She never brings anything but blouses.
ARoomWithAView	52	59027	59021	59073	Minnie	How I do detest blouses! [MASK]!" Paganism is infectious--more infectious than diphtheria or piety--and the Rector's niece was taken to church protesting. As usual, she didn't see why. Why shouldn't she sit in the sun with the young men?
ARoomWithAView	46	60023	59982	60028	George	"What DO you mean? No, never mind what you mean. Don't explain. He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon. Do you play tennis? Do you mind tennis on Sunday--?" "[MASK] mind tennis on Sunday!
ARoomWithAView	41	60259	60246	60287	Bertolini	Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow. It was the pension [MASK] again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine. It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
ARoomWithAView	48	60288	60288	60336	George	[MASK] did not respond to the bow. Like any boy, he blushed and was ashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered. He said: "I--I'll come up to tennis if I can manage it," and went into the house.
ARoomWithAView	46	60345	60337	60383	Lucy	Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased [MASK], but his awkwardness went straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and need help.
ARoomWithAView	53	60711	60662	60715	Cecil	He does not love me. No. How terrible if he did! But he has not told. He will not tell." She longed to shout the words: "It is all right. It's a secret between us two for ever. [MASK] will never hear.
ARoomWithAView	51	60863	60848	60899	Cecil	"Proteges!" she exclaimed with some warmth. For the only relationship which [MASK] conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected. He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl's soul yearned. "You shall see for yourself how your proteges are.
ARoomWithAView	48	60946	60918	60966	Cecil	Only don't--" She nearly said, "Don't protect him." But the bell was ringing for lunch, and, as often happened, [MASK] had paid no great attention to her remarks. Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.
ARoomWithAView	41	61213	61212	61253	George	There [MASK] was. He had crept in without interrupting her. "Oh, I had no idea!" she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without a word of greeting, she reopened the piano.
ARoomWithAView	50	61254	61216	61266	Cecil	He had crept in without interrupting her. "Oh, I had no idea!" she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without a word of greeting, she reopened the piano. [MASK] should have the Parsifal, and anything else that he liked.
ARoomWithAView	45	61332	61325	61370	Freddy	"I vote tennis," said [MASK], disgusted at the scrappy entertainment. "Yes, so do I." Once more she closed the unfortunate piano. "I vote you have a men's four." "All right."
ARoomWithAView	51	61381	61340	61391	Cecil	"Yes, so do I." Once more she closed the unfortunate piano. "I vote you have a men's four." "All right." "Not for me, thank you," said [MASK]. "I will not spoil the set."
ARoomWithAView	46	61624	61597	61643	Cecil	She kept it without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon. As she changed her frock, she wondered whether [MASK] was sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him.
ARoomWithAView	45	61695	61661	61706	George	How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms. Once more music appeared to her the employment of a child. [MASK] served, and surprised her by his anxiety to win.
ARoomWithAView	54	61968	61915	61969	Lucy	He had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others. He would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out: "I say, listen to this, [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	43	61980	61970	62013	Lucy	Three split infinitives." "Dreadful!" said [MASK], and missed her stroke. When they had finished their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and really everyone must listen to it.
ARoomWithAView	53	62072	62066	62119	George	" She had "forgiven" [MASK], as she put it, and she made a point of being pleasant to him. He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: "You--and are you tired?" "Of course I'm not!"
ARoomWithAView	50	62549	62525	62575	Cecil	But I suppose one ought to read it as one's met her." "All modern books are bad," said [MASK], who was annoyed at her inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature. "Every one writes for money in these days."
ARoomWithAView	46	62599	62599	62645	Cecil	[MASK], this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow. The ups and downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her. She had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his.
ARoomWithAView	51	62737	62696	62747	Cecil	"I never notice much difference in views." "What do you mean?" "Because they're all alike. Because all that matters in them is distance and air." "H'm!" said [MASK], uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.
ARoomWithAView	54	62872	62822	62876	Lucy	"He told us another day that views are really crowds--crowds of trees and houses and hills--and are bound to resemble each other, like human crowds--and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural, for the same reason." [MASK]'s lips parted.
ARoomWithAView	50	62978	62930	62980	Cecil	she murmured. "I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again. I'm so sorry he's not so well." "No, he isn't well." "There's an absurd account of a view in this book," said [MASK]. "
ARoomWithAView	48	63324	63306	63354	Cecil	"No, of course not really," she answered. "Chapter two," said [MASK], yawning. "Find me chapter two, if it isn't bothering you." Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.
ARoomWithAView	44	63750	63749	63793	Lucy	But [MASK] had developed since the spring. That is to say, she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove. Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by deep sobs.
ARoomWithAView	50	63797	63780	63830	Cecil	Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by deep sobs. She said to [MASK], "I am not coming in to tea--tell mother--I must write some letters," and went up to her room. Then she prepared for action.
ARoomWithAView	53	64039	64009	64062	Lucy	The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only from others, but from his own soul. In a few moments [MASK] was equipped for battle. "Something too awful has happened," she began, as soon as her cousin arrived.
ARoomWithAView	48	65006	64988	65036	Lucy	"Willingly would I move heaven and earth--" "I want something more definite," said [MASK] contemptuously. "Will you speak to him? It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all happened because you broke your word."
ARoomWithAView	42	65105	65099	65141	Lucy	"Very well," said [MASK], with an angry gesture. "No one will help me. I will speak to him myself." And immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along.
ARoomWithAView	41	65183	65154	65195	Lucy	Found the lost ball? Good man! Want any tea?" And there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace. "Oh, [MASK], but that is brave of you! I admire you--"
ARoomWithAView	45	65200	65192	65237	George	I admire you--" They had gathered round [MASK], who beckoned, she felt, over the rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul. Her anger faded at the sight of him. Ah!
ARoomWithAView	41	65414	65406	65447	George	"The jam's jolly good." [MASK], looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the dining-room. As she entered he stopped, and said: "No--nothing to eat."
ARoomWithAView	45	65511	65472	65517	Lucy	Where's mother?" "She's started on her Sunday writing. She's in the drawing-room." "That's all right. You go away." He went off singing. [MASK] sat down at the table.
ARoomWithAView	50	65709	65667	65717	Vyse	The line was unexpected. She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her. "You are merely ridiculous," she said quietly. Then his words rose gravely over hers: "You cannot live with [MASK]. He's only for an acquaintance.
ARoomWithAView	53	65756	65750	65803	Vyse	"Have you ever talked to [MASK] without feeling tired?" "I can scarcely discuss--" "No, but have you ever? He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things--books, pictures--but kill when they come to people.
ARoomWithAView	48	65846	65804	65852	Cecil	That's why I'll speak out through all this muddle even now. It's shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your [MASK] had been a different person.
ARoomWithAView	47	65964	65929	65976	Cecil	Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for YOU to settle whether you were shocked or no. [MASK] all over again. He daren't let a woman decide.
ARoomWithAView	53	66147	66101	66154	Lucy	But it has frightened you, and you may not have noticed that I love you. Or would you have told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly? But therefore--therefore I settled to fight him." [MASK] thought of a very good remark.
ARoomWithAView	50	66302	66295	66345	Lucy	He stretched them towards her. "[MASK], be quick--there's no time for us to talk now--come to me as you came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain. I have cared for you since that man died.
ARoomWithAView	50	66435	66427	66477	Cecil	Does he not matter? That I love [MASK] and shall be his wife shortly? A detail of no importance, I suppose?" But he stretched his arms over the table towards her. "May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?"
ARoomWithAView	49	66616	66582	66631	Lucy	She did not answer. "It is being young," he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go. "It is being certain that [MASK] cares for me really. It is that love and youth matter intellectually."
ARoomWithAView	59	66736	66682	66741	Lucia	He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house. Their tongues were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings. "Oh, [MASK]--come back here--
ARoomWithAView	51	66750	66742	66793	Lucy	oh, what an awful man!" [MASK] had no reaction--at least, not yet. "Well, he amuses me," she said. "Either I'm mad, or else he is, and I'm inclined to think it's the latter.
ARoomWithAView	53	66801	66772	66825	Charlotte	"Either I'm mad, or else he is, and I'm inclined to think it's the latter. One more fuss through with you, [MASK]. Many thanks. I think, though, that this is the last. My admirer will hardly trouble me again."
ARoomWithAView	48	67134	67089	67137	Lucy	As you well remarked this very morning, 'There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books'; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not inflict myself on you." The scales fell from [MASK]'s eyes.
ARoomWithAView	45	67167	67162	67207	Cecil	Chapter XVII: Lying to [MASK] He was bewildered. He had nothing to say. He was not even angry, but stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion.
ARoomWithAView	51	67416	67378	67429	Lucy	I shall never be able to talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should." "I don't understand you. You aren't like yourself. You're tired, [MASK]." "Tired!" she retorted, kindling at once.
ARoomWithAView	46	67688	67644	67690	Freddy	Things must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day. If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you--when you wouldn't play tennis with [MASK]."
ARoomWithAView	50	67700	67691	67741	Cecil	"I never do play tennis," said [MASK], painfully bewildered; "I never could play. I don't understand a word you say." "You can play well enough to make up a four. I thought it abominably selfish of you."
ARoomWithAView	50	67798	67788	67838	Lucy	"I knew you wouldn't understand," said [MASK] quite crossly. "I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations. Of course, it isn't the tennis--that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks.
ARoomWithAView	48	67911	67902	67950	Cecil	There was always a lot against our engagement, [MASK], but all our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good mentioning it until--well, until all things came to a point. They have to-day.
ARoomWithAView	51	67975	67959	68010	Cecil	That's all." "I cannot think you were right," said [MASK] gently. "I cannot tell why, but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not treating me fairly. It's all too horrible."
ARoomWithAView	48	68166	68135	68183	Cecil	I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards. As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good talking." But to [MASK], now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment more desirable.
ARoomWithAView	48	68656	68619	68667	Cecil	That's why I break off my engagement. You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when you came to people--" She stopped. There was a pause. Then [MASK] said with great emotion: "It is true."
ARoomWithAView	56	68982	68971	69027	Europe	It's your old idea, the idea that has kept [MASK] back--I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men. If a girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: 'Oh, she had some one else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.'
ARoomWithAView	50	69156	69117	69167	Cecil	I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was. I only meant that there was a force in you that I hadn't known of up till now." "All right, [MASK], that will do. Don't apologize to me.
ARoomWithAView	56	69267	69221	69277	Lucy	"I must actually thank you for what you have done--for showing me what I really am. Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman. Will you shake hands?" "Of course I will," said [MASK], twisting up her other hand in the curtains.
ARoomWithAView	51	69283	69278	69329	Cecil	"Good-night, [MASK]. Good-bye. That's all right. I'm sorry about it. Thank you very much for your gentleness." "Let me light your candle, shall I?" They went into the hall. "Thank you.
ARoomWithAView	52	69339	69289	69341	Lucy	That's all right. I'm sorry about it. Thank you very much for your gentleness." "Let me light your candle, shall I?" They went into the hall. "Thank you. Good-night again. God bless you, [MASK]!"
ARoomWithAView	50	69347	69342	69392	Cecil	"Good-bye, [MASK]." She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings. On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
ARoomWithAView	53	70876	70873	70926	Freddy	All right, [MASK]--I am not being clever, upon my word I am not--I took the idea from another fellow; and give me those matches when you've done with them." He lit a cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men.
ARoomWithAView	47	70984	70948	70995	Phidias	Big enough in all conscience. The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me. There the contrast is just as much as I can realize. But not the Parthenon, not the frieze of [MASK] at any price; and here comes the victoria."
ARoomWithAView	47	71059	71042	71089	Vyse	And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for [MASK]'s match-box, which had not been returned. As he took it, he said: "I'm so glad you only talked about books.
ARoomWithAView	51	71095	71095	71146	Lucy	[MASK] won't marry him. If you'd gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken down." "But when--" "Late last night. I must go." "Perhaps they won't want me down there."
ARoomWithAView	58	71409	71367	71425	Powell	Look at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage having to go out, when I had counted on having [MASK], who--give every one their due--does tie up dahlias properly."
ARoomWithAView	54	71498	71477	71531	Minnie	The garden-child, who did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror. [MASK] slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear longways instead of across.
ARoomWithAView	57	71597	71566	71623	Charlotte	I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may." "Oh, must you? Yes do.--Not the scissors, thank you, [MASK], when both my hands are full already--I'm perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it."
ARoomWithAView	42	71984	71952	71994	Lucy	Would you come too?" "I don't think I will, thank you." "No, I didn't suppose you would care to much." [MASK] turned to the piano and struck a few chords.
ARoomWithAView	54	72777	72750	72804	Lucy	"Would your mother spare you again so soon? You have scarcely been home three months." "She MUST spare me!" cried [MASK], in growing excitement. "I simply MUST go away. I have to." She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair. "
ARoomWithAView	49	72831	72805	72854	Constantinople	Don't you see that I HAVE to go away? I didn't realize at the time--and of course I want to see [MASK] so particularly." "You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel--" "Yes, yes.
ARoomWithAView	41	72882	72882	72923	Cecil	[MASK] had evidently taken up the dignified line, and was not going to annoy her. Then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying. He hinted this to her, and she accepted the hint eagerly.
ARoomWithAView	51	72971	72964	73015	Cecil	"No, not at all. [MASK] was very kind indeed; only--I had better tell you the whole truth, since you have heard a little--it was that he is so masterful. I found that he wouldn't let me go my own way.
ARoomWithAView	48	73029	73003	73051	Cecil	I found that he wouldn't let me go my own way. He would improve me in places where I can't be improved. [MASK] won't let a woman decide for herself--in fact, he daren't. What nonsense I do talk!
ARoomWithAView	45	73310	73309	73354	Lucy	"[MASK] can always play," was the acid reply. "One is very thankful that she has such a resource. She is evidently much worried, as, of course, she ought to be. I know all about it.
ARoomWithAView	52	73595	73595	73647	One	[MASK] cannot be too careful." "Quite so." "I do implore absolute secrecy. A chance word to a chattering friend, and--" "Exactly." He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.
ARoomWithAView	44	74284	74252	74296	Lucy	"I can't see the point of it myself." To his astonishment, she replied: "There I cannot agree with you. In it I spy [MASK]'s salvation." "Really. Now, why?"
ARoomWithAView	45	75321	75298	75343	Lucy	"Good. Now come up to the house." They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour. [MASK] would never have carried the Greek scheme alone. It was expensive and dramatic--both qualities that her mother loathed.
ARoomWithAView	51	75678	75661	75712	Freddy	She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness. Her mother bent over her. [MASK], to whom she had been singing, reclined on the floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips. Oddly enough, the group was beautiful.
ARoomWithAView	52	75888	75844	75896	Freddy	"It isn't very good," she said listlessly. "I forget why--harmony or something." "I suspected it was unscholarly. It's so beautiful." "The tune's right enough," said [MASK], "but the words are rotten.
ARoomWithAView	50	76031	75982	76032	Freddy	"Stop thine ear against the singer--" "Wait a minute; she is finishing." "From the red gold keep thy finger; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die." "I love weather like this," said [MASK].
ARoomWithAView	52	76567	76552	76604	Lucy	It is such a pleasure to have met you!" They escaped, and [MASK] said with relief: "That's all right. We just got through that time." But her mother was annoyed. "I should be told, dear, that I am unsympathetic.
ARoomWithAView	51	76618	76605	76656	Cecil	But I cannot see why you didn't tell your friends about [MASK] and be done with it. There all the time we had to sit fencing, and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most unpleasant."
ARoomWithAView	53	76878	76873	76926	Cecil	You've got rid of [MASK]--well and good, and I'm thankful he's gone, though I did feel angry for the minute. But why not announce it? Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?" "It's only for a few days."
ARoomWithAView	44	76934	76901	76945	Lucy	But why not announce it? Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?" "It's only for a few days." "But why at all?" [MASK] was silent. She was drifting away from her mother.
ARoomWithAView	43	77062	77039	77082	Freddy	She was thinking, "My daughter won't answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with [MASK] and me. Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home."
ARoomWithAView	53	77141	77137	77190	Freddy	It might exist for [MASK], who still lived and thought straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain. She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very instruments of life.
ARoomWithAView	44	77364	77322	77366	Mudie	She laughed faintly, "Half a minute would be nearer." "Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?" "Hush, mother! People will hear you"; for they had entered [MASK]'s.
ARoomWithAView	46	77369	77367	77413	Baedeker	She bought [MASK], and then continued: "Of course I want to live at home; but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been.
ARoomWithAView	43	77450	77414	77457	Lucy	You see, I come into my money next year." Tears came into her mother's eyes. Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed "eccentricity," [MASK] determined to make this point clear.
ARoomWithAView	54	77625	77598	77652	Lucy	And then to prepare yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them." "I want more independence," said [MASK] lamely; she knew that she wanted something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we have not got it.
ARoomWithAView	46	77660	77653	77699	Florence	She tried to remember her emotions in [MASK]: those had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latch-keys. But independence was certainly her cue. "Very well. Take your independence and be gone.
ARoomWithAView	49	77751	77722	77771	Lucy	Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted, and our dear view--and then share a flat with another girl." [MASK] screwed up her mouth and said: "Perhaps I spoke hastily." "Oh, goodness!"
ARoomWithAView	47	77822	77805	77852	Charlotte	"More every moment." "I don't know what you mean, mother; [MASK] and I are not the very least alike." "Well, I see the likeness. The same eternal worrying, the same taking back of words.
ARoomWithAView	41	77855	77833	77874	Charlotte	"Well, I see the likeness. The same eternal worrying, the same taking back of words. You and [MASK] trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters." "What rubbish!
ARoomWithAView	52	77879	77871	77923	Charlotte	"What rubbish! And if you dislike [MASK] so, it's rather a pity you asked her to stop. I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you not to, but of course it was not listened to." "There you go."
ARoomWithAView	53	77932	77893	77946	Charlotte	I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you not to, but of course it was not listened to." "There you go." "I beg your pardon?" "[MASK] again, my dear; that's all; her very words."
ARoomWithAView	47	78090	78053	78100	Charlotte	Leaning forward, she looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful. "The crush when [MASK] gets in will be abominable," she remarked.
ARoomWithAView	46	78838	78838	78884	George	[MASK] is so sorry! He thought he had a right to try. I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he had told me first. He ought not to have tried. I knew nothing about it at all."
ARoomWithAView	57	79413	79413	79470	Lucy	[MASK] was frightened. "And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round. She thought it a judgement." He shuddered. "Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents.
ARoomWithAView	52	79745	79745	79797	George	[MASK] last Sunday--no, not ill: just gone under. He is never ill. But he is his mother's son. Her eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful, and he will not think it worth while to live.
ARoomWithAView	49	80092	80087	80136	George	"I must be with [MASK]; I must make him care to live, and down here he can't. He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you--I am not justifying him: I am only saying what has happened."
ARoomWithAView	42	80289	80283	80325	George	No, it was wrong of [MASK] to try. We have pushed our beliefs too far. I fancy that we deserve sorrow." She looked at the books again--black, brown, and that acrid theological blue.
ARoomWithAView	52	80468	80458	80510	George	But you are, and there's a look of [MASK] about you. And what were you saying about going abroad?" She was silent. "Greece"--and she saw that he was thinking the word over--"Greece; but you were to be married this year, I thought."
ARoomWithAView	54	80522	80486	80540	Lucy	"Greece"--and she saw that he was thinking the word over--"Greece; but you were to be married this year, I thought." "Not till January, it wasn't," said [MASK], clasping her hands. Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point?
ARoomWithAView	50	80664	80618	80668	Powell	"I counted on you two keeping each other company. It's pouring again. The entire congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it. Did [MASK] go round?"
ARoomWithAView	54	81145	81120	81174	George	I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know better now, and all my teaching of [MASK] has come down to this: beware of muddle. Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren't?
ARoomWithAView	50	81319	81271	81321	George	I think he puts it well. Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along--especially the function of Love." Then he burst out excitedly; "That's it; that's what I mean. You love [MASK]!"
ARoomWithAView	58	81333	81322	81380	Lucy	And after his long preamble, the three words burst against [MASK] like waves from the open sea. "But you do," he went on, not waiting for contradiction. "You love the boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word expresses it.
ARoomWithAView	50	81400	81393	81443	Lucy	"How dare you!" gasped [MASK], with the roaring of waters in her ears. "Oh, how like a man!--I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man." "But you are." She summoned physical disgust.
ARoomWithAView	51	81525	81491	81542	George	I have no time for the tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that really matter, and for which you marry. I know that, with [MASK], you will find them, and that you love him. Then be his wife.
ARoomWithAView	54	81631	81595	81649	Lucy	You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal." [MASK] began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon, her tears remained.
ARoomWithAView	49	81880	81842	81891	Lucy--	She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote. Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the bottom of her soul. "Then, [MASK]" "You've frightened me," she moaned.
ARoomWithAView	51	81960	81921	81972	George	I must suffer and grow old away from him. I cannot break the whole of life for his sake. They trusted me." A carriage drew up at the front-door. "Give [MASK] my love--once only. Tell him 'muddle.'
ARoomWithAView	58	82185	82145	82203	Lucy	He was very quiet, and his white face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman. A long black column, he stood and awaited her reply. "I shall never marry him," quavered [MASK]. A look of contempt came over him, and he said, "Why not?"
ARoomWithAView	52	82515	82515	82567	George	[MASK] still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word from him. Am I justified?" Into his own eyes tears came. "Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth. Truth counts, Truth does count."
ARoomWithAView	46	82919	82908	82954	George	"Why shouldn't I be a baby?" murmured [MASK]. Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was trying to mend, and gazed out through the window. It was evening and again the spring.
ARoomWithAView	54	82959	82921	82975	Charlotte	Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was trying to mend, and gazed out through the window. It was evening and again the spring. "Oh, bother [MASK]," she said thoughtfully. "What can such people be made of?"
ARoomWithAView	52	83575	83557	83609	Cecil	He has to build us both up from the beginning again. I wish, though, that [MASK] had not turned so cynical about women. He has, for the second time, quite altered. Why will men have theories about women? I haven't any about men.
ARoomWithAView	45	83817	83784	83829	Signorino	Ah! it was worth while; it was the great joy that they had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt. They were silent. "[MASK], domani faremo--" "Oh, bother that man!"
ARoomWithAView	53	83910	83904	83957	Charlotte	How horrible to grow old in [MASK]'s way! To think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn't have heard your father was in the house. For she would have stopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense.
ARoomWithAView	47	84194	84194	84241	George	[MASK], who disliked any darkness, said: "It's clear that she knew. Then, why did she risk the meeting? She knew he was there, and yet she went to church." They tried to piece the thing together.
ARoomWithAView	43	84251	84211	84254	Lucy	Then, why did she risk the meeting? She knew he was there, and yet she went to church." They tried to piece the thing together. As they talked, an incredible solution came into [MASK]'s mind.
ARoomWithAView	51	84393	84371	84422	George	"Buona sera--e grazie." "Niente." The cabman drove away singing. "Mean what, [MASK]?" He whispered: "Is it this? Is this possible? I'll put a marvel to you. That your cousin has always hoped.
ARoomWithAView	50	84549	84531	84581	Lucy	There are details--it burnt. I read the book afterwards. She is not frozen, [MASK], she is not withered up all through. She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy.
ARoomWithAView	55	84624	84593	84648	Lucy	But I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she is glad." "It is impossible," murmured [MASK], and then, remembering the experiences of her own heart, she said: "No--it is just possible."
