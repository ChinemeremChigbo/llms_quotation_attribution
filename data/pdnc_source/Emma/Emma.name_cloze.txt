Emma	45	263	256	301	Emma	The real evils, indeed, of [MASK]'s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments.
Emma	44	344	302	346	Taylor	The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her. Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.--Miss [MASK] married.
Emma	54	370	358	412	Emma	It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that [MASK] first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening.
Emma	45	1496	1479	1524	James	We must go in the carriage, to be sure." "The carriage! But [MASK] will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit?"
Emma	49	1652	1640	1689	James	It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor [MASK] think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.
Emma	52	1805	1792	1844	Emma	He will be able to tell her how we all are." [MASK] spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.
Emma	48	2323	2304	2352	Emma	"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!" said [MASK] playfully. "That is what you have in your head, I know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by."
Emma	44	2594	2578	2622	Emma	The chances are that she must be a gainer." "Well," said [MASK], willing to let it pass--"you want to hear about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved charmingly.
Emma	49	3907	3902	3951	Emma	Invite him to dinner, [MASK], and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself."
Emma	58	7263	7224	7282	Emma	She was short, plump, and fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, [MASK] was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the acquaintance.
Emma	46	7893	7893	7939	Serle	[MASK] understands boiling an egg better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.
Emma	57	8028	8002	8059	Emma	A _small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with you." [MASK] allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy.
Emma	41	8535	8517	8558	Harriet	Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents, but [MASK] could not tell. She was ready to tell every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain.
Emma	47	8559	8540	8587	Emma	She was ready to tell every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. [MASK] was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth.
Emma	43	10548	10522	10565	Emma	But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it." [MASK] watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no alarming symptoms of love.
Emma	48	10728	10683	10731	Harriet	His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in [MASK]'s inclination.
Emma	46	11368	11362	11408	Harriet	The older a person grows, [MASK], the more important it is that their manners should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later age.
Emma	47	11440	11430	11477	Harriet	"There is no saying, indeed," replied [MASK] rather solemnly. "But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing but profit and loss."
Emma	50	11840	11823	11873	Harriet	I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us, [MASK], by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please you.
Emma	55	12784	12730	12785	Emma	The list she drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from [MASK].
Emma	49	12993	12986	13035	Emma	And ever since she was twelve, [MASK] has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her."
Emma	57	13283	13243	13300	Weston	"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We will not despair, however. [MASK] may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him."
Emma	55	13563	13557	13612	Emma	"I either depend more upon [MASK]'s good sense than you do, or am more anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. How well she looked last night!" "Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you?
Emma	46	13622	13588	13634	Emma	How well she looked last night!" "Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very well; I shall not attempt to deny [MASK]'s being pretty." "Pretty! say beautiful rather.
Emma	52	13644	13628	13680	Emma	"Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than [MASK] altogether--face and figure?" "I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers.
Emma	53	13773	13736	13789	Emma	There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health;' now, [MASK] always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health.
Emma	54	13982	13953	14007	Emma	No, no; she has qualities which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no lasting blunder; where [MASK] errs once, she is in the right a hundred times." "Very well; I will not plague you any more.
Emma	55	14177	14155	14210	Emma	Pray excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected that [MASK], accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.
Emma	42	14462	14437	14479	Emma	It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object. I should like to see [MASK] in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.
Emma	50	14927	14913	14963	Harriet	"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but [MASK] only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have done very little."
Emma	54	15108	15057	15111	Harriet	"I have no doubt of it." And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have [MASK]'s picture.
Emma	48	15178	15162	15210	Emma	dear, no, never." No sooner was she out of sight, than [MASK] exclaimed, "What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.
Emma	51	15619	15599	15650	Harriet	It was not lost on me. But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded." [MASK] was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others.
Emma	49	16239	16191	16240	George	I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That's very like. I am rather proud of little [MASK].
Emma	46	16548	16532	16578	Emma	Exactly so. No husbands and wives," with so interesting a consciousness, that [MASK] began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.
Emma	56	17833	17800	17856	Emma	"What a precious deposit!" said he with a tender sigh, as he received it. "This man is almost too gallant to be in love," thought [MASK]. "I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love.
Emma	47	17867	17857	17904	Harriet	He is an excellent young man, and will suit [MASK] exactly; it will be an 'Exactly so,' as he says himself; but he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal.
Emma	49	18258	18214	18263	Harriet	"Upon my word," she cried, "the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can." "Will you read the letter?" cried [MASK]. "Pray do.
Emma	57	18369	18342	18399	Harriet	It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it, while [MASK] stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a "Well, well," and was at last forced to add, "Is it a good letter?
Emma	46	18577	18542	18588	Harriet	It is so with some men. Yes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, [MASK] (returning it,) than I had expected."
Emma	51	18597	18589	18640	Harriet;--"well	"Well," said the still waiting [MASK]--and--and what shall I do?" "What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this letter?" "Yes." "But what are you in doubt of?
Emma	56	18797	18795	18851	Harriet	My dear [MASK], what do you mean? Are you in any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer.
Emma	58	18868	18813	18871	Harriet	I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it." [MASK] was silent.
Emma	50	18879	18872	18922	Emma	With a little reserve of manner, [MASK] continued: "You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect." "No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would you advise me to do?
Emma	42	18986	18949	18991	Harriet	I will have nothing to do with it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings." "I had no notion that he liked me so very much," said [MASK], contemplating the letter.
Emma	47	19227	19192	19239	Emma	It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say 'No,' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say 'No?'" "Not for the world," said [MASK], smiling graciously, "would I advise you either way.
Emma	47	19337	19320	19367	Harriet	At this moment whom are you thinking of?" The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, [MASK] turned away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard.
Emma	54	19450	19434	19488	Harriet	Do you think I am right?" "Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest [MASK]; you are doing just what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving.
Emma	49	19580	19580	19629	Harriet	[MASK] had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly. "You could not have visited me!" she cried, looking aghast. "No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before.
Emma	50	19666	19663	19713	Harriet	"Indeed, [MASK], it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society. I must have given you up." "Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it!
Emma	55	20016	20016	20071	Emma	[MASK] felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a "very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that her husband could write a good letter."
Emma	56	20681	20626	20682	Emma	"I wonder what they are all doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy, they will be unhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much." "Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed," cried [MASK].
Emma	58	20854	20805	20863	Harriet	It opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm prepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!" [MASK] smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.
Emma	53	20902	20873	20926	Emma	For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and [MASK] judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible just at present.
Emma	51	21177	21153	21204	Emma	"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me." "I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. [MASK] will be happy to entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns--my winter walk."
Emma	47	21576	21540	21587	Harriet	"Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she intended." "Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps." "Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!" "[MASK] may not consider every body tiresome that you would."
Emma	58	21588	21588	21646	Emma	[MASK] knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said nothing. He presently added, with a smile, "I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage."
Emma	50	22363	22333	22383	Emma	"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the foolish girl about?" "Oh! to be sure," cried [MASK], "it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage.
Emma	49	22462	22427	22476	Emma	madness, if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken." "I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer." "You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too. [MASK], this is your doing. You persuaded her to refuse him."
Emma	54	23533	23503	23557	Emma	And as to conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he had encouragement." It was most convenient to [MASK] not to make a direct reply to this assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.
Emma	45	23581	23581	23626	Harriet	[MASK]'s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly.
Emma	48	23856	23851	23899	Emma	"Upon my word, [MASK], to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply it as you do." "To be sure!" cried she playfully.
Emma	49	23920	23890	23939	Harriet	"To be sure!" cried she playfully. "I know _that_ is the feeling of you all. I know that such a girl as [MASK] is exactly what every man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment.
Emma	55	23942	23942	23997	Harriet	[MASK] may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives?
Emma	52	24093	24053	24105	Vanity	You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her. [MASK] working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief.
Emma	43	24717	24704	24747	Emma	Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt on [MASK]'s side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was thinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.
Emma	46	25022	24980	25026	Emma	I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece." "I am very much obliged to you," said [MASK], laughing again.
Emma	52	25149	25108	25160	Emma	He was very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded [MASK] had taken in the affair, was provoking him exceedingly.
Emma	45	26494	26457	26502	Kitty	So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time." And it always ended in "[MASK], a fair but frozen maid."
Emma	59	26879	26828	26887	Emma	He called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his manner, [MASK] was immediately convinced must be his own.
Emma	49	27421	27376	27425	Harriet	and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon now." She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations, which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the eagerness of [MASK]'s wondering questions.
Emma	50	27526	27509	27559	Neptune	Can it be woman? And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone. Can it be [MASK]? Behold him there, the monarch of the seas! Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one syllable.
Emma	45	27599	27590	27635	Harriet	"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear [MASK], what are you thinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.
Emma	50	27801	27778	27828	Harriet	Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you." [MASK] could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not speak.
Emma	53	28010	27987	28040	Harriet	Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my dear [MASK], with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing but good.
Emma	54	28074	28031	28085	Hartfield	This is a connexion which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing that you want--consideration, independence, a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends, close to [MASK] and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever.
Emma	46	28181	28171	28217	Harriet	"Whatever you say is always right," cried [MASK], "and therefore I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not have imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve.
Emma	48	29002	28963	29011	Harriet	"It is as long again as almost all we have had before." "I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things in general cannot be too short." [MASK] was too intent on the lines to hear.
Emma	52	29404	29381	29433	Harriet	Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be no possible reflection on you." [MASK] submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love.
Emma	54	29470	29464	29518	Emma	"Very well," replied [MASK]; "a most natural feeling; and the longer it lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you will not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him so much pleasure!
Emma	49	29556	29510	29559	Harriet	It will be giving him so much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him." [MASK] looked grave.
Emma	48	29563	29560	29608	Harriet	"My dear [MASK], you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it.
Emma	56	29903	29849	29905	Emma	"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true. 'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so prettily, but you, [MASK]."
Emma	50	29906	29906	29956	Emma	[MASK] only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a very tender sigh, he added, "Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother was so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory!
Emma	51	30551	30548	30599	Emma	I think, [MASK], I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well." "Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do not think you ever will.
Emma	52	30600	30565	30617	Isabella	She and the children might stay very well." "Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do not think you ever will. [MASK] cannot bear to stay behind her husband." This was too true for contradiction.
Emma	45	30667	30666	30711	Harriet	"[MASK] must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the children. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa?
Emma	48	30889	30852	30900	Grandpapa	And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will come and stand by my chair, and say, '[MASK], can you give me a bit of string?'
Emma	49	30943	30921	30970	Emma	I think their father is too rough with them very often." "He appears rough to you," said [MASK], "because you are so very gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not think him rough.
Emma	43	31263	31248	31291	Cole	If he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend [MASK] had been saying so much about his dining with him--had made such a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come.
Emma	54	31476	31466	31520	Emma	With the view of passing off an awkward moment, [MASK] smilingly said, "You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman's approbation while he writes with such gallantry."
Emma	46	31626	31615	31661	Emma	After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. [MASK] could not think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh.
Emma	47	32557	32553	32600	Harriet	"Never mind, [MASK], I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old maid!
Emma	51	32749	32749	32800	Poverty	[MASK] certainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm." "Dear me!
Emma	47	32824	32818	32865	Harriet	"If I know myself, [MASK], mine is an active, busy mind, with a great many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.
Emma	47	33242	33228	33275	Emma	They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were superseded. [MASK] was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse.
Emma	53	33376	33329	33382	Harriet	In the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to [MASK], as they walked away,
Emma	57	33389	33383	33440	Harriet	"These are the sights, [MASK], to do one good. How trifling they make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?"
Emma	52	33447	33396	33448	Harriet	How trifling they make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?" "Very true," said [MASK].
Emma	48	33478	33461	33509	Emma	"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over," said [MASK], as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them into the lane again.
Emma	47	33593	33593	33640	Harriet	[MASK], here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that is truly important.
Emma	46	33669	33641	33687	Harriet	If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves." [MASK] could just answer, "Oh! dear, yes," before the gentleman joined them.
Emma	50	33764	33748	33798	Emma	"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this," thought [MASK]; "to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration.
Emma	49	34314	34290	34339	Harriet	They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting [MASK] into the house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot, and fall behind to arrange it once more.
Emma	51	34537	34502	34553	Emma	The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between them was open, and [MASK] passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner.
Emma	53	34672	34627	34680	Emma	It could be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and make her appearance. The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, [MASK] felt the glory of having schemed successfully.
Emma	53	34707	34681	34734	Harriet	But it would not do; he had not come to the point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told [MASK] that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.
Emma	50	35953	35931	35981	Emma	"Oh yes, sir," cried she with ready sympathy, "how you must miss her! And dear [MASK], too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her.--It is a sad change
Emma	43	36465	36461	36504	Emma	You and I, [MASK], will venture to take the part of the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.
Emma	56	36781	36756	36812	Emma	"Has he been here on this occasion--or has he not?" "He has not been here yet," replied [MASK]. "There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately."
Emma	52	37618	37618	37670	Emma	[MASK] felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby, "What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.
Emma	44	37897	37866	37910	Emma	"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear [MASK], let us be friends, and say no more about it.
Emma	54	38451	38447	38501	Isabella	"My poor dear [MASK]," said he, fondly taking her hand, and interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her five children--"How long it is, how terribly long since you were here! And how tired you must be after your journey!
Emma	54	38536	38492	38546	Emma	And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear [MASK], suppose we all have a little gruel."
Emma	51	38696	38689	38740	Perry	"Ah! my dear, but [MASK] had many doubts about the sea doing her any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use to any body.
Emma	50	38758	38741	38791	Emma	I am sure it almost killed me once." "Come, come," cried [MASK], feeling this to be an unsafe subject, "I must beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;--I who have never seen it!
Emma	51	39009	38965	39016	Bella	"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes, you had better let him look at little [MASK]'s throat." "Oh!
Emma	43	39301	39280	39323	Perry	"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you mention. [MASK] says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November.
Emma	48	40686	40640	40688	Perry	A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You should have consulted [MASK]."
Emma	48	40799	40787	40835	Emma	It seemed to him a very ill-judged measure." [MASK]'s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her brother-in-law's breaking out.
Emma	50	42986	42972	43022	Emma	I think your manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, [MASK]. You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do." "I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.
Emma	50	44088	44067	44117	Emma	This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable; but it should have lasted longer. [MASK] was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things, and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.
Emma	44	44475	44475	44519	Weston	[MASK] indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;--it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.
Emma	43	45144	45134	45177	Harriet	The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards [MASK], from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.
Emma	52	46346	46309	46361	Frank	"Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself to speak ill of her, on [MASK]'s account; for I do believe her to be very fond of him.
Emma	47	47165	47157	47204	Emma	"He ought to come," said [MASK]. "If he could stay only a couple of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having it in his power to do as much as that.
Emma	56	47326	47300	47356	Enscombe	"One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family; but [MASK], I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her."
Emma	52	47509	47476	47528	Emma	I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be." [MASK] listened, and then coolly said, "I shall not be satisfied, unless he comes."
Emma	49	48034	48007	48056	Harriet	She was vexed. It did appear--there was no concealing it--exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of [MASK]; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper.
Emma	51	48817	48793	48844	James	To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her representation of the excellence of the horses, and of [MASK], and of their having so many friends about them, revived him a little. His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own.
Emma	50	49037	49033	49083	Isabella	Then, my dear [MASK], it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does give you cold. Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home, I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses."
Emma	41	49612	49590	49631	James	He did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together as they could;" and [MASK] was talked to, and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.
Emma	50	49738	49703	49753	Harriet	It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to him of [MASK], and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but one.
Emma	50	50187	50160	50210	Harriet	and I can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of [MASK], in such a manner. Command yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it."
Emma	49	50620	50586	50635	Emma	You cannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me." It would be impossible to say what [MASK] felt, on hearing this--which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost.
Emma	51	50707	50690	50741	Emma	It confesses that you have long understood me." "No, sir," cried [MASK], "it confesses no such thing. So far from having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views, till this moment.
Emma	51	51629	51614	51665	Harriet	How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never thought seriously of [MASK]--never! She looked back as well as she could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it.
Emma	46	51711	51666	51712	Harriet	His manners, however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so misled. The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--and the charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--how clearly they had seemed to point at [MASK].
Emma	47	53881	53857	53904	Resentment	She admired him for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced. [MASK] could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.
Emma	41	54900	54883	54924	Emma	Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and [MASK] felt that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace for herself. CHAPTER XVIII
Emma	58	55985	55958	56016	Emma	He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others." "There is one thing, [MASK], which a man can always do, if he chuses, and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and resolution.
Emma	52	56168	56133	56185	Emma	'--If he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to his going." "No," said [MASK], laughing; "but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again.
Emma	52	56902	56858	56910	Emma	He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there would have been no difficulty now." "We shall never agree about him," cried [MASK]; "but that is nothing extraordinary.
Emma	51	57152	57113	57164	Randalls	They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's place, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on her account that attention to [MASK] is doubly due, and she must doubly feel the omission.
Emma	43	57221	57194	57237	Emma	Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself? No, [MASK], your amiable young man can be amiable only in French, not in English.
Emma	49	57746	57735	57784	Emma	"I will say no more about him," cried [MASK], "you turn every thing to evil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here." "Prejudiced!
Emma	47	59163	59136	59183	Hetty	My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She often says, when the letter is first opened, 'Well, [MASK], now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--don't you,
Emma	50	59281	59281	59331	Jane	[MASK] often says, when she is here, 'I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may last me as well.'"
Emma	47	59578	59537	59584	Jane	By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over, she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very remarkable that she should always hear [MASK] better than she does me.
Emma	52	59585	59585	59637	Jane	[MASK] speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my mother's time of life--and it really is full two years, you know, since she was here.
Emma	52	60816	60815	60867	Jane	"[MASK] caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her?
Emma	55	61092	61069	61124	Jane	I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that. I always make a point of reading [MASK]'s letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her.
Emma	50	61125	61125	61175	Jane	[MASK] desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me!
Emma	46	61287	61268	61314	Jane	The expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so fond of [MASK] that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know.
Emma	44	61346	61334	61378	Jane	Well, now I have just given you a hint of what [MASK] writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her."
Emma	44	63899	63895	63939	Emma	They had music; [MASK] was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance.
Emma	51	64175	64157	64208	Emma	It was known that they were a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could [MASK] procure as to what he truly was. "Was he handsome?"--"She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man." "Was he agreeable?"--"He was generally thought so."
Emma	52	64744	64728	64780	Emma	"You think her diffident. I do not see it." "My dear [MASK]," said he, moving from his chair into one close by her, "you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant evening."
Emma	45	64976	64976	65021	Emma	[MASK] saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question-- "She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from.
Emma	59	65333	65303	65362	Serle	They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as [MASK] boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome."
Emma	50	65874	65870	65920	Elton	He had just read [MASK]'s letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly." "Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful.
Emma	44	65969	65956	66000	Emma	it certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that [MASK] and I cannot have a greater pleasure than--" "Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to us.
Emma	46	67231	67194	67240	Jane	Where I have a regard, I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the general opinion, when I called him plain." "Well, my dear [MASK], I believe we must be running away.
Emma	49	67425	67425	67474	Emma	[MASK], alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--and to marry strangers too--and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject.
Emma	41	67954	67929	67970	Elizabeth	only think. I thought I should have fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the door--[MASK] saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella.
Emma	58	68538	68535	68593	Emma	Very sincerely did [MASK] wish to do so; but it was not immediately in her power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly comfortable herself. The young man's conduct, and his sister's, seemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them.
Emma	48	68595	68594	68642	Harriet	As [MASK] described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?
Emma	49	70014	69968	70017	Harriet	On that article, truth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be uncertain; but _who_ she was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at all [MASK]'s superior.
Emma	43	70287	70253	70296	Harriet	She had talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out of it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of [MASK]'s mind was not to be talked away.
Emma	45	71620	71584	71629	Harriet	Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally [MASK] must suffer. It was a bad business.
Emma	48	71731	71687	71735	Randalls	They must be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--so much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of [MASK] to procure it.
Emma	41	72487	72462	72503	Harriet	When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to [MASK], she saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.
Emma	50	73235	73217	73267	Emma	That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously through [MASK]'s brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner had no air of study or exaggeration.
Emma	48	73802	73802	73850	Emma	[MASK] wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance.
Emma	44	74441	74412	74456	Frank	Do not defer it. What is right to be done cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, [MASK]; any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided.
Emma	41	74524	74494	74535	Emma	If you do not call early it will be a slight." The son looked convinced. "I have heard her speak of the acquaintance," said [MASK]; "she is a very elegant young woman."
Emma	59	75044	75010	75069	Highbury.--"He	He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk, immediately fixed on [MASK] did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always chuse the same.
Emma	58	76002	75974	76032	Enscombe	He seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of [MASK]. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind.
Emma	58	76495	76454	76512	Emma	Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was. "Well," said [MASK], "there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire her except her complexion."
Emma	47	76553	76538	76585	Ford	Were you often in the same society?" At this moment they were approaching [MASK]'s, and he hastily exclaimed, "Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives, as my father informs me.
Emma	53	77131	77108	77161	Emma	I will move a little farther off." "I certainly do forget to think of _her_," said [MASK], "as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend." He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.
Emma	42	78422	78421	78463	Emma	But [MASK], in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.
Emma	44	80617	80593	80637	James	But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be done. We must remember to let [MASK] know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him.
Emma	58	80659	80638	80696	James	We have never been there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have no doubt that [MASK] will take you very safely. And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour.
Emma	47	82601	82600	82647	Jane	But [MASK], it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it. She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present.
Emma	51	85280	85270	85321	Emma	The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, [MASK] guessed to be good behaviour to his father. "I have made a most wretched discovery," said he, after a short pause.-- "I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.
Emma	59	85704	85678	85737	Emma	"This is the luxury of a large party," said she:--"one can get near every body, and say every thing. My dear [MASK], I am longing to talk to you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.
Emma	48	87048	87006	87054	Emma	Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'" "For shame, [MASK]! Do not mimic her.
Emma	45	87402	87370	87415	Emma	"Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told her so." "There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear [MASK]. I have a very strong notion that it comes from him.
Emma	55	88144	88099	88154	James	"I often feel concern," said she, "that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that [MASK] should put-to for such a purpose."
Emma	52	88321	88317	88369	Jane	Towards the end of [MASK]'s second song, her voice grew thick. "That will do," said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--"you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet." Another song, however, was soon begged for.
Emma	51	89215	89208	89259	Harriet	"Don't class us together, [MASK]. My playing is no more like her's, than a lamp is like sunshine." "Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite as well as she does.
Emma	44	90264	90244	90288	Emma	What am I to do?" "I am here on no business of my own," said [MASK]; "I am only waiting for my friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.
Emma	47	91412	91407	91454	Jane	Only three of us.--besides dear [MASK] at present--and she really eats nothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I say one thing
Emma	46	91688	91669	91715	Jane	Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a little too large about the wrist; but [MASK] is taking them in." "What was I talking of?" said she, beginning again when they were all in the street.
Emma	52	91716	91695	91747	Emma	"What was I talking of?" said she, beginning again when they were all in the street. [MASK] wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix. "I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother's spectacles.
Emma	51	92850	92829	92880	Emma	Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing [MASK] again. "This is a pleasure," said he, in rather a low voice, "coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated.
Emma	48	93326	93318	93366	Emma	"It is not fair," said [MASK], in a whisper; "mine was a random guess. Do not distress her." He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy.
Emma	50	93817	93803	93853	Emma	He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning to [MASK], said, "Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.--And here are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might expect.
Emma	52	95990	95949	96001	Emma!--Emma	It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in. "Oh! no," said he; "it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not bear it for [MASK] is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.
Emma	52	96241	96216	96268	Emma	"We were too magnificent," said he. "We allowed unnecessary room. Ten couple may stand here very well." [MASK] demurred. "It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in?"
Emma	41	97504	97478	97519	James	They will be so near their own stable." "So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that [MASK] ever complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can.
Emma	46	97770	97726	97772	Perry	He said, from the first, it was a very good sort--which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send for [MASK]."
Emma	43	97951	97950	97993	Emma	"[MASK]," said she, "this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined."
Emma	53	98030	97994	98047	Randalls	"My dear, you are too particular," said her husband. "What does all that signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as clean as [MASK] by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our club-nights."
Emma	51	98472	98440	98491	Frank	To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be." "Yes, very true," cried [MASK], "very true. You want your neighbours' opinions. I do not wonder at you.
Emma	48	99570	99535	99583	Emma	I do not know who does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different." This [MASK] felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry.
Emma	50	100115	100115	100165	Emma	[MASK] was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it.
Emma	53	100218	100166	100219	Emma	His dejection was most evident. He sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say, "Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst." "But you will come again," said [MASK].
Emma	52	100405	100366	100418	Emma	I would much rather have been merry than wise." "If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends on it. Do not forget your engagement." [MASK] looked graciously. "Such a fortnight as it has been!"
Emma	47	100467	100455	100502	Emma	"As you do us such ample justice now," said [MASK], laughing, "I will venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first? Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do.
Emma	54	100547	100536	100590	Emma	He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, [MASK] was convinced that it had been so. "And you must be off this very morning?" "Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I must be off immediately.
Emma	48	100932	100885	100933	Hartfield	He could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said, "It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to [MASK].
Emma	56	101689	101657	101713	Jane	She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball taken place, she did not think [MASK] could have attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health.
Emma	53	102905	102861	102914	Harriet	Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For [MASK], it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.
Emma	56	103466	103425	103481	Harriet	I have not forgotten it, I assure you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it." [MASK] felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation.
Emma	46	103641	103624	103670	Harriet	I want you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that [MASK] would not forget what was due--or rather what would be kind by me." This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.
Emma	46	103880	103864	103910	Isabella	It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved--which gives [MASK] all her popularity.--I have it not--but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives.
Emma	44	104161	104137	104181	Harriet	A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was not to be supposed that poor [MASK] should not be recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent.
Emma	46	104560	104554	104600	Emma	There was a little hesitation in [MASK]'s answer. "Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman." "I think her beautiful, quite beautiful." "Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."
Emma	48	104648	104617	104665	Harriet	"Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and she came in his way." "I dare say," returned [MASK], sighing again, "I dare say she was very much attached to him."
Emma	44	106049	106025	106069	Augusta	I absolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion; but [MASK], I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.'
Emma	50	106621	106608	106658	Highbury	Upon these occasions, a lady's character generally precedes her; and [MASK] has long known that you are a superior performer." "Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior performer!--very far from it, I assure you.
Emma	56	107290	107250	107306	Selina	"But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger, surely?" "I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance, I tremble. [MASK] has entirely given up music--never touches the instrument--though she played sweetly.
Emma	56	107365	107345	107401	Selina	Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with [MASK]; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention. I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper."
Emma	54	107663	107629	107683	Emma	Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest model for any young woman." "And who do you think came in while we were there?" [MASK] was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance--and how could she possibly guess?
Emma	51	107817	107789	107840	Emma	Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man." Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and [MASK] could breathe. "Insufferable woman!" was her immediate exclamation. "Worse than I had supposed. Absolutely insufferable!
Emma	54	108559	108522	108576	Emma	"My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry." [MASK] had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand _her_.
Emma	47	110585	110568	110615	Emma	"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my dear [MASK]--but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome.
Emma	50	111127	111121	111171	Emma	"And yet," said [MASK], beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--she hurried on--"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is.
Emma	43	111509	111499	111542	Emma	The result of his reverie was, "No, [MASK], I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure you."
Emma	48	114183	114180	114228	Jane	"My dear [MASK], what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office in the rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl, how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you."
Emma	46	114229	114229	114275	Jane	[MASK] very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold. "Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed!
Emma	48	114471	114467	114515	Mr.	I shall speak to [MASK] E. The man who fetches our letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and from _us_
Emma	54	114604	114557	114611	Jane	I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before." "My dear [MASK], say no more about it.
Emma	44	114700	114678	114722	Jane	If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as settled." "Excuse me," said [MASK] earnestly, "I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant.
Emma	54	114764	114723	114777	Patty	If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am not here, by my grandmama's." "Oh! my dear; but so much as [MASK] has to do!--And it is a kindness to employ our men."
Emma	51	115422	115390	115441	Emma	No, she had heard from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had put it away. "If we were in the other room," said [MASK], "if I had my writing-desk, I am sure I could produce a specimen.
Emma	51	115975	115968	116019	June	"But I have never fixed on [MASK] or any other month--merely looked forward to the summer in general." "But have you really heard of nothing?" "I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet."
Emma	42	116380	116362	116404	June	"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and [MASK], or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before us. Your inexperience really amuses me!
Emma	51	116991	116969	117020	Jane	"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a situation together," said [MASK], "they are pretty sure to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me.
Emma	48	118067	118049	118097	Frank	As to her illness, all nothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have [MASK] among us again, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us.
Emma	48	118121	118077	118125	Emma	They will stay a good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted. Well, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has [MASK] read it all?
Emma	44	118215	118207	118251	Emma	Her congratulations were warm and open; but [MASK] could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she rather thought was considerable.
Emma	41	119326	119321	119362	Frank	She is very fond of [MASK], and therefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health now; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been.
Emma	48	119735	119721	119769	Frank	He had done his duty and could return to his son. "When [MASK] left us," continued he, "it was quite uncertain when we might see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It has been completely unexpected.
Emma	56	121071	121053	121109	Emma	He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with-- "Well, [MASK], I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure.
Emma	53	121535	121528	121581	Emma	"Upon my word," exclaimed [MASK], "you amuse me! I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys.
Emma	46	122886	122863	122909	Frank	He was quite delighted. It was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be really having [MASK] in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to a young man?--An hour's ride. He would be always coming over.
Emma	50	123453	123421	123471	Emma	They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage, which [MASK] could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize. "So unreasonably early!
Emma	54	123765	123765	123819	Frank	[MASK] was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.
Emma	47	124521	124487	124534	Jane	As the door opened she was heard, "So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And [MASK] declares--Well!--(as soon as she was within the door) Well!
Emma	52	125659	125619	125671	Emma	"Ungrateful!--What do you mean?" Then changing from a frown to a smile--"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?" [MASK] could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour.
Emma	45	126411	126407	126452	Harriet	He would not ask [MASK] to dance if it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room. Escape, however, was not his plan.
Emma	41	126993	126984	127025	Harriet	She was all pleasure and gratitude, both for [MASK] and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though too distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could catch his eye again.
Emma	55	127042	127026	127081	Harriet	His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good; and [MASK] would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced.
Emma	50	127549	127525	127575	Jane	we all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, [MASK], take care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two.
Emma	53	127758	127721	127774	Jane	I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since--Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that [MASK] is not in a draught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.
Emma	52	128014	128008	128060	Emma	"I did," replied [MASK], "and they cannot forgive me." He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he only said, "I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections."
Emma	53	129065	129063	129116	Harriet	But poor [MASK] could not follow. She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless--and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.
Emma	42	129600	129563	129605	Emma	Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So [MASK] thought, at least.
Emma	51	129974	129957	130008	Emma	It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account proceed. [MASK]'s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible.
Emma	54	130418	130413	130467	Harriet	There was a seriousness in [MASK]'s manner which prepared her, quite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary. "It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish," she continued, "to have no reserves with you on this subject.
Emma	47	130537	130498	130545	Emma	I do not want to say more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I dare say you understand me." "Yes," said [MASK], "I hope I do."
Emma	49	130843	130798	130847	Emma	"Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?" "No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued very much." She held the parcel towards her, and [MASK] read the words _
Emma	59	130927	130922	130981	Harriet	"Now," said [MASK], "you _must_ recollect." "No, indeed I do not." "Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It
Emma	49	131298	131264	131313	Emma	I am sure I never suspected it, you did it so naturally." "And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!" said [MASK], recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement.
Emma	52	131364	131359	131411	Harriet	"Here," resumed [MASK], turning to her box again, "here is something still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister never did."
Emma	50	131607	131568	131618	Emma	But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment." "I do remember it," cried [MASK]; "I perfectly remember it.--Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh!
Emma	51	131693	131671	131722	Elton	"Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but I cannot recollect.--Mr. [MASK] was sitting here, I remember, much about where I am now."-- "Well, go on." "Oh! that's all.
Emma	49	131764	131716	131765	Harriet	"Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see me do it." "My poor dear [MASK]!
Emma	47	131782	131779	131826	simpleton	"Yes, [MASK] as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married.
Emma	52	131846	131827	131879	Harriet	I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them." "But, [MASK], is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful."
Emma	52	132078	132078	132130	Emma	[MASK] then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied, "Never marry!--This is a new resolution." "It is one that I shall never change, however."
Emma	58	132340	132295	132353	Harriet	She had previously determined how far she would proceed, on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--She was decided, and thus spoke-- "[MASK], I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning.
Emma	59	132474	132416	132475	Harriet	mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially." "I am not at all surprized at you, [MASK].
Emma	53	132600	132548	132601	Harriet	"It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.--Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--But that it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not advise you to give way to it, [MASK].
Emma	50	132746	132712	132762	Harriet	We were very wrong before; we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but yet, [MASK], more wonderful things have taken place, there have been matches of greater disparity.
Emma	51	132811	132769	132820	Harriet	I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value." [MASK] kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude.
Emma	51	133036	133035	133086	Emma	That [MASK] was his object appeared indisputable. Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints, his mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story.
Emma	53	133901	133901	133954	Perry	[MASK]'s setting up his carriage! and his wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health--just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!
Emma	57	134369	134335	134392	Jane	I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like [MASK]; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world.
Emma	52	134712	134694	134746	Emma	We had great amusement with those letters one morning. I want to puzzle you again." [MASK] was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves.
Emma	57	134957	134922	134979	Harriet	If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and [MASK], eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work.
Emma	47	135463	135430	135477	Jane	Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned towards her aunt. "Aye, very true, my dear," cried the latter, though [MASK] had not spoken a word--"I was just going to say the same thing.
Emma	47	135520	135488	135535	Jane	The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good night." [MASK]'s alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived.
Emma	58	135767	135767	135825	Emma	[MASK] was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them. "Oh!" she cried in evident embarrassment, "it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves."
Emma	52	135890	135858	135910	Emma	She would rather busy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in doubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference--fruitless interference. [MASK]'s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak.
Emma	51	137042	137006	137057	Emma	One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its own amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not leave her out." [MASK] denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.
Emma	51	137484	137478	137529	Elton	"I hope you will bring [MASK]," said he: "but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations." "Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider--you need not be afraid of delegating power to _me_.
Emma	52	137764	137753	137805	Knightley	It is to be a morning scheme, you know, [MASK]; quite a simple thing. I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm. Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be more simple, you see.
Emma	56	137807	137771	137827	Jane	I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm. Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be more simple, you see. And [MASK] will have such another. There is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party.
Emma	42	140973	140966	141008	Emma	She spoke with great agitation; and [MASK] very feelingly replied, "That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the carriage. The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already."
Emma	53	141030	140992	141045	Woodhouse	I must order the carriage. The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already." "I am,"--she answered--"I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss [MASK], we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits.
Emma	51	141085	141085	141136	Emma	[MASK] had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was grateful--and her parting words, "Oh!
Emma	48	141190	141177	141225	Emma	"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!" said [MASK], as she turned back into the hall again. "I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you."
Emma	46	141464	141450	141496	Emma	"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still," said [MASK]. "As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming!
Emma	49	141662	141637	141686	Emma	" In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. [MASK] returned all her attention to her father, saying in secret-- "I am glad I have done being in love with him.
Emma	43	142799	142767	142810	Harriet	He said nothing worth hearing--looked without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without knowing what she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that [MASK] should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.
Emma	48	143625	143619	143667	Emma	"Oh! no, no"--cried [MASK], laughing as carelessly as she could--"Upon no account in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of.
Emma	49	144048	144003	144052	Emma	I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth, shan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every body's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?" [MASK] could not resist.
Emma	47	144354	144327	144374	Emma	"What two letters!--express perfection! I am sure I do not know." "Ah! you will never guess. You, (to [MASK]), I am certain, will never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?"
Emma	51	145168	145162	145213	Emma	Will you? (turning to [MASK].) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a smile at his father). Find some body for me.
Emma	50	145307	145274	145324	Emma	I care for nothing else. I shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return, I shall come to you for my wife. Remember." [MASK] was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling.
Emma	43	145510	145509	145552	Emma	Even [MASK] grew tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her.
Emma	51	145679	145660	145711	Emma	He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said, "[MASK], I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it.
Emma	47	145763	145763	145810	Emma	[MASK] recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off. "Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it. It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me."
Emma	50	146004	145965	146015	Emma	Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation--but, [MASK], consider how far this is from being the case.
Emma	45	146960	146933	146978	Donwell	She had no objection. She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers. Her eyes were towards [MASK] as she walked, but she saw him not. "The ladies were all at home.
Emma	43	147226	147217	147260	Hetty	I hope you find a chair. I wish [MASK] had not gone. I am very little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where you like? I am sure she will be here presently."
Emma	46	147781	147745	147791	Patty	Nobody else would come so early.' 'Well,' said she, 'it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.' But then [MASK] came in, and said it was you. '
Emma	50	148936	148929	148979	Emma	"Ah! madam," cried [MASK], "if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly earned."
Emma	41	149973	149973	150014	Knightley	[MASK] immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly graver than usual, said, "I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and therefore must now be gone directly.
Emma	51	150081	150081	150132	Emma	[MASK] was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends again. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--her father began his inquiries.
Emma	42	151025	151025	151067	Goldsmith	[MASK] tells us, that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.
Emma	45	152130	152130	152175	Emma	[MASK] felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted.
Emma	53	152879	152837	152890	Randalls	"--He met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father, "Can you come to [MASK] at any time this morning?--Do, if it be possible.
Emma	48	153032	152985	153033	Emma	she really not ill?" "Depend upon me--but ask no more questions. You will know it all in time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!" To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for [MASK].
Emma	46	153155	153119	153165	Emma	"No, no,"--he gravely replied.--"Don't ask me. I promised my wife to leave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not be impatient, [MASK]; it will all come out too soon."
Emma	49	153267	153243	153292	Emma	Which of them is it?--I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment." "Upon my word, [MASK]."-- "Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour, that it has nothing to do with any of them?
Emma	57	153348	153293	153350	Knightley	Good Heavens!--What can be to be _broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?" "Upon my honour," said he very seriously, "it does not. It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of [MASK]."
Emma	41	153411	153382	153423	Emma	I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern you--it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short, my dear [MASK], there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.
Emma	41	153539	153523	153564	Frank	Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural children, perhaps--and poor [MASK] cut off!--This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.
Emma	53	153682	153643	153696	Frank	"Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind." For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded and demure, "Yes, [MASK] came over this morning, just to ask us how we did."
Emma	48	153705	153697	153745	Randalls.--"Well	They hurried on, and were speedily at [MASK], my dear," said he, as they entered the room--"I have brought her, and now I hope you will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in delay.
Emma	49	153759	153733	153782	Emma	I shall leave you together. There is no use in delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me."--And [MASK] distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,--"I have been as good as my word.
Emma	51	154362	154362	154413	Emma	[MASK] pondered a moment, and then replied, "I will not pretend _not_ to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are apprehensive of."
Emma	49	154859	154816	154865	Emma	to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman, before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity, which I can neither comprehend nor respect." "There were misunderstandings between them, [MASK]; he said so expressly.
Emma	45	155129	155094	155139	Emma	What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself--to suffer her even to think of such a measure!" "He knew nothing about it, [MASK]. On this article I can fully acquit him.
Emma	51	155806	155775	155826	Emma	"None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves." "Well," said [MASK], "I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea, and I wish them very happy.
Emma	54	156110	156085	156139	Emma	His wife gave him a look which invited him in; and, while he was coming round, added, "Now, dearest [MASK], let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match.
Emma	56	156869	156861	156917	Harriet	Common sense would have directed her to tell [MASK], that she must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--"But, with common sense," she added, "I am afraid I have had little to do."
Emma	46	157182	157162	157208	Harriet	Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on [MASK]'s mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.--She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon as possible.
Emma	54	157835	157819	157873	Emma	"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject," replied [MASK], smiling; "but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him?"
Emma	43	158281	158261	158304	Emma	When we talked about him, it was as clear as possible." "Not quite," returned [MASK], with forced calmness, "for all that you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person.
Emma	44	158652	158612	158656	Emma	At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--" She paused a few moments. [MASK] could not speak.
Emma	50	158902	158902	158952	Emma	[MASK]'s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating, in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers, once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.
Emma	49	159066	159045	159094	Harriet	She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before. How improperly had she been acting by [MASK]! How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been her conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on!
Emma	42	159653	159621	159663	Emma	When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. [MASK] knew it to have been very much the case.
Emma	43	162825	162805	162848	Jane	They were both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation; thought so much of [MASK]; so much of every body, and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them.
Emma	56	163102	163062	163118	Emma	I will not say, that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--and the quivering lip, [MASK], which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart."
Emma	46	163125	163119	163165	Emma	"Poor girl!" said [MASK]. "She thinks herself wrong, then, for having consented to a private engagement?" "Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself. '
Emma	48	163407	163375	163423	Emma	Her affection must have overpowered her judgment." "Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him." "I am afraid," returned [MASK], sighing, "that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy."
Emma	44	163690	163676	163720	Emma	"If I did not know her to be happy now," said [MASK], seriously, "which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh!
Emma	49	165070	165060	165109	Emma	With all the eagerness which such a transition gives, [MASK] resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her.
Emma	52	165408	165389	165441	Harriet	And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to [MASK]; he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject. He must do it all himself.
Emma	52	165862	165862	165914	Emma	[MASK] understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied, "You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion.
Emma	46	165981	165980	166026	Emma	"[MASK]!" cried he, looking eagerly at her, "are you, indeed?"--but checking himself--"No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am pleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret, indeed!
Emma	49	166116	166076	166125	Jane	I could only be certain that there was a preference--and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?--Jane, [MASK], you will be a miserable creature."
Emma	56	167161	167161	167217	Emma	[MASK], I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the next moment." "Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it," she eagerly cried. "Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself."
Emma	50	167239	167218	167268	Emma	"Thank you," said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not another syllable followed. [MASK] could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in her--perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.
Emma	56	167287	167269	167325	Harriet	She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give just praise to [MASK], or, by representing to him his own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They had reached the house.
Emma	52	167622	167582	167634	Emma	Say 'No,' if it is to be said."--She could really say nothing.--"You are silent," he cried, with great animation; "absolutely silent! at present I ask no more." [MASK] was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.
Emma	44	167659	167652	167696	Emma	"I cannot make speeches, [MASK]:" he soon resumed; and in a tone of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing.--"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.
Emma	49	169318	169314	169363	Harriet	Her father--and [MASK]. She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered.
Emma	50	173449	173411	173461	Emma	He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, "Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few months ago, [MASK], it would not have been taken with such indifference."
Emma	47	173728	173704	173751	Emma:--but	You pass it over very handsomely--but you were perfectly right." "I was not quite impartial in my judgment, [MASK] yet, I think--had _you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him."
Emma	51	173901	173876	173927	Emma	Natural enough!--his own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert the understanding! My [MASK], does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?"
Emma	54	174273	174235	174289	Emma	We must look to her one fault, and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment." [MASK] knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew uncomfortable.
Emma	44	174947	174947	174991	Emma	[MASK]'s answer was ready at the first word. "While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her. She could never quit him." Part only of this answer, however, was admitted.
Emma	41	175723	175718	175759	Harriet	In such a party, [MASK] would be rather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.
Emma	46	177392	177392	177438	Things	[MASK] did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again.
Emma	54	177777	177770	177824	Miss	"Upon my word it is, [MASK] Bates.--He really is engaged from morning to night.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretence or other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always wanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without him.--'Upon
Emma	59	178264	178261	178320	Jane	I say, [MASK], what a perfect character you and I should make, if we could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--not a word, if you please."
Emma	51	178632	178615	178666	Knightley	"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see [MASK] to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made it so much the worse.
Emma	44	179383	179346	179390	Emma	I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if your compassion does not stand my friend--" "Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are," cried [MASK] warmly, and taking her hand.
Emma	50	179512	179464	179514	Windsor	I feel that all the apologies should be on my side. Let us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you have pleasant accounts from [MASK]?"
Emma	50	180013	179999	180049	Emma	It will be the only difference." "Poor child!" cried [MASK]; "at that rate, what will become of her?" "Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older.
Emma	56	180062	180035	180091	Emma	She will be disagreeable in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest [MASK]. I, who am owing all my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them?"
Emma	51	180092	180064	180115	Emma	I, who am owing all my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them?" [MASK] laughed, and replied: "But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people.
Emma	55	180281	180227	180282	Emma	I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least." "I am sure you were of use to me," cried [MASK].
Emma	47	180505	180498	180545	George	"I remember once calling you '[MASK],' in one of my amiable fits, about ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as you made no objection, I never did it again."
Emma	48	180785	180748	180796	Isabella	She was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on [MASK]'s letters. He might observe that it was so.
Emma	47	181012	181000	181047	Emma	It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. [MASK] accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned.
Emma	45	181275	181274	181319	Emma	"[MASK], my dear Emma--" "Oh!" she cried with more thorough gaiety, "if you fancy your brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret, and hear his opinion.
Emma	49	181369	181336	181385	Emma	He will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not sink into 'poor [MASK]' with him at once.--His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther."
Emma	42	181432	181425	181467	John	I am amused by one part of [MASK]'s letter--did you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind."
Emma	49	181604	181562	181611	Uncle	I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, '[MASK] seems always tired now.'"
Emma	51	182905	182859	182910	Jane	"It is to be a secret, I conclude," said he. "These matters are always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether [MASK] has any suspicion."
Emma	44	183220	183201	183245	Knightley!--There	qualities.--How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love--not in the least.--Poor [MASK] would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him!
Emma	51	183427	183398	183449	Emma	After the first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began with, "I have something to tell you, [MASK]; some news." "Good or bad?" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.
Emma	51	183506	183467	183518	Emma	I am sure.--I see it in your countenance. You are trying not to smile." "I am afraid," said he, composing his features, "I am very much afraid, my dear [MASK], that you will not smile when you hear it."
Emma	52	183596	183546	183598	Smith	"There is one subject," he replied, "I hope but one, on which we do not think alike." He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on her face. "Does nothing occur to you?--Do not you recollect?--Harriet [MASK]."
Emma	46	184431	184414	184460	Emma	Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while, he added, "[MASK], my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.
Emma	49	184605	184562	184611	Harriet	He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering, "You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think [MASK] is doing extremely well. _
Emma	50	185180	185145	185195	Emma	I assured him that I could not. Then, he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day." "I am perfectly satisfied," replied [MASK], with the brightest smiles, "and most sincerely wish them happy."
Emma	50	185242	185196	185246	Harriet	"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before." "I hope so--for at that time I was a fool." "And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all [MASK]'s good qualities.
Emma	47	185566	185539	185586	Harriet	The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of [MASK]'s welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.--What had she to wish for?
Emma	52	186163	186144	186196	Emma	I hope you do not retract what you then said." "No, indeed," cried [MASK], most happy to begin, "not in the least. I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy in person."
Emma	56	186446	186391	186447	Emma	But though I was always doing wrong things, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing." "It is not now worth a regret," said [MASK].
Emma	55	186749	186727	186782	Emma	So peculiarly the lady in it.--Just colour enough for beauty." "I have always admired her complexion," replied [MASK], archly; "but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?--When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?"
Emma	53	186808	186798	186851	Emma	But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that [MASK] could not help saying, "I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I am sure it was a consolation to you."
Emma	49	187138	187130	187179	Emma	"Very beautiful, indeed," replied [MASK]; and she spoke so kindly, that he gratefully burst out, "How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world.
Emma	59	187608	187608	187667	Jane	[MASK] was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet steady voice, "How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--They _will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!"
