DaisyMiller	45	1021	1000	1045	Winterbourne	he asked in a sharp, hard little voice--a voice immature and yet, somehow, not young. [MASK] glanced at the small table near him, on which his coffee service rested, and saw that several morsels of sugar remained.
DaisyMiller	54	1157	1146	1200	Winterbourne	he exclaimed, pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner. [MASK] had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman. "Take care you don t hurt your teeth," he said, paternally. "I haven t got any teeth to hurt.
DaisyMiller	48	1276	1270	1318	Winterbourne	It s these hotels." [MASK] was much amused. "If you eat three lumps of sugar, your mother will certainly slap you," he said. "She s got to give me some candy, then," rejoined his young interlocutor.
DaisyMiller	52	1353	1319	1371	Winterbourne	"I can t get any candy here--any American candy. American candy s the best candy." "And are American little boys the best little boys?" asked [MASK]. "I don t know. I m an American boy," said the child.
DaisyMiller	43	1384	1355	1398	Winterbourne	"I don t know. I m an American boy," said the child. "I see you are one of the best!" laughed [MASK]. "Are you an American man?" pursued this vivacious infant.
DaisyMiller	51	1403	1399	1450	Winterbourne	And then, on [MASK] s affirmative reply--"American men are the best," he declared. His companion thanked him for the compliment, and the child, who had now got astride of his alpenstock, stood looking about him, while he attacked a second lump of sugar.
DaisyMiller	50	1498	1490	1540	Winterbourne	"She s an American girl." [MASK] looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing. "American girls are the best girls," he said cheerfully to his young companion. "My sister ain t the best!" the child declared.
DaisyMiller	53	1563	1511	1564	Winterbourne	"American girls are the best girls," he said cheerfully to his young companion. "My sister ain t the best!" the child declared. "She s always blowing at me." "I imagine that is your fault, not hers," said [MASK].
DaisyMiller	52	1632	1595	1647	Winterbourne	She was bareheaded, but she balanced in her hand a large parasol, with a deep border of embroidery; and she was strikingly, admirably pretty. "How pretty they are!" thought [MASK], straightening himself in his seat, as if he were prepared to rise.
DaisyMiller	48	1704	1670	1718	Randolph	The little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole, by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little. "[MASK]," said the young lady, "what ARE you doing?"
DaisyMiller	49	1775	1766	1815	Randolph	"He s an American man!" cried [MASK], in his little hard voice. The young lady gave no heed to this announcement, but looked straight at her brother. "Well, I guess you had better be quiet," she simply observed.
DaisyMiller	46	1819	1816	1862	Winterbourne	It seemed to [MASK] that he had been in a manner presented. He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl, throwing away his cigarette. "This little boy and I have made acquaintance," he said, with great civility.
DaisyMiller	58	1929	1920	1978	Winterbourne	This pretty American girl, however, on hearing [MASK] s observation, simply glanced at him; she then turned her head and looked over the parapet, at the lake and the opposite mountains. He wondered whether he had gone too far, but he decided that he must advance farther, rather than retreat.
DaisyMiller	44	2022	1979	2023	Randolph	While he was thinking of something else to say, the young lady turned to the little boy again. "I should like to know where you got that pole," she said. "I bought it," responded [MASK].
DaisyMiller	54	2262	2262	2316	Randolph	[MASK] loudly inquired. "I hope not," said his sister. "I guess you have had enough candy, and mother thinks so too." "I haven t had any for ever so long--for a hundred weeks!" cried the boy, still jumping about.
DaisyMiller	49	2330	2292	2341	Winterbourne	"I haven t had any for ever so long--for a hundred weeks!" cried the boy, still jumping about. The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again; and [MASK] presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view.
DaisyMiller	57	2716	2716	2773	Winterbourne	[MASK], laughing, answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans, but that he had not, so far as he remembered, met an American who spoke like a German. Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted.
DaisyMiller	50	2905	2856	2906	Winterbourne	"And I ll tell you her name;" and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister. "You had better wait till you are asked!" said this young lady calmly. "I should like very much to know your name," said [MASK].
DaisyMiller	49	3214	3181	3230	Winterbourne	There is one boy here, but he always goes round with a teacher; they won t let him play." "And your brother hasn t any teacher?" [MASK] inquired. "Mother thought of getting him one, to travel round with us.
DaisyMiller	46	3282	3262	3308	Randolph	She told her of this teacher, and we thought of getting him to travel round with us. But [MASK] said he didn t want a teacher traveling round with us. He said he wouldn t have lessons when he was in the cars.
DaisyMiller	41	3435	3425	3466	Winterbourne	"Very good, I should think," said [MASK]. "Or else she s going to find some school. He ought to learn some more. He s only nine. He s going to college."
DaisyMiller	48	3517	3487	3535	Winterbourne	She sat there with her extremely pretty hands, ornamented with very brilliant rings, folded in her lap, and with her pretty eyes now resting upon those of [MASK], now wandering over the garden, the people who passed by, and the beautiful view.
DaisyMiller	48	4090	4079	4127	Winterbourne	She paused again for an instant; she was looking at [MASK] with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and in her light, slightly monotonous smile. "I have always had," she said, "a great deal of gentlemen s society."
DaisyMiller	50	4313	4279	4329	Winterbourne	Were they all like that, the pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemen s society? Or was she also a designing, an audacious, an unscrupulous young person? [MASK] had lost his instinct in this matter, and his reason could not help him.
DaisyMiller	48	4593	4582	4630	Winterbourne	"Yes, formerly, more than once," said [MASK]. "You too, I suppose, have seen it?" "No; we haven t been there. I want to go there dreadfully. Of course I mean to go there.
DaisyMiller	50	4656	4631	4681	Winterbourne	I wouldn t go away from here without having seen that old castle." "It s a very pretty excursion," said [MASK], "and very easy to make. You can drive, you know, or you can go by the little steamer."
DaisyMiller	51	4706	4695	4746	Winterbourne	"Yes; you can go in the cars," [MASK] assented. "Our courier says they take you right up to the castle," the young girl continued. "We were going last week, but my mother gave out. She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia.
DaisyMiller	42	4754	4728	4770	Randolph	"We were going last week, but my mother gave out. She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia. She said she couldn t go. [MASK] wouldn t go either; he says he doesn t think much of old castles.
DaisyMiller	47	5085	5047	5094	Winterbourne	"She don t like to ride round in the afternoon. But did you really mean what you said just now--that you would like to go up there?" "Most earnestly," [MASK] declared. "Then we may arrange it.
DaisyMiller	46	5234	5191	5237	Eugenio	This program seemed almost too agreeable for credence; he felt as if he ought to kiss the young lady s hand. Possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project, but at this moment another person, presumably [MASK], appeared.
DaisyMiller	52	5406	5403	5455	Winterbourne	She turned to [MASK], blushing a little--a very little. "You won t back out?" she said. "I shall not be happy till we go!" he protested. "And you are staying in this hotel?" she went on. "
DaisyMiller	47	5469	5424	5471	Winterbourne	she said. "I shall not be happy till we go!" he protested. "And you are staying in this hotel?" she went on. "And you are really an American?" The courier stood looking at [MASK] offensively.
DaisyMiller	46	6163	6137	6183	Winterbourne	"Of course she s pretty. But she is very common." "I see what you mean, of course," said [MASK] after another pause. "She has that charming look that they all have," his aunt resumed.
DaisyMiller	47	6502	6466	6513	Winterbourne	"I said I should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable aunt." "I am much obliged to you." "It was to guarantee my respectability," said [MASK]. "And pray who is to guarantee hers?"
DaisyMiller	54	6662	6611	6665	Winterbourne	I should say it proved just the contrary. How long had you known her, may I ask, when this interesting project was formed? You haven t been twenty-four hours in the house." "I have known her half an hour!" said [MASK], smiling.
DaisyMiller	46	6832	6793	6839	Winterbourne	You have lived too long out of the country. You will be sure to make some great mistake. You are too innocent." "My dear aunt, I am not so innocent," said [MASK], smiling and curling his mustache.
DaisyMiller	52	7304	7265	7317	Randolph	"She doesn t sleep--not three hours. She says she doesn t know how she lives. She s dreadfully nervous. I guess she sleeps more than she thinks. She s gone somewhere after [MASK]; she wants to try to get him to go to bed.
DaisyMiller	52	7726	7698	7750	Winterbourne	The young girl looked at him through the dusk. "But I suppose she doesn t have a headache every day," she said sympathetically. [MASK] was silent a moment. "She tells me she does," he answered at last, not knowing what to say.
DaisyMiller	50	7820	7789	7839	Winterbourne	she said suddenly. "Why don t you say so? You needn t be afraid. I m not afraid!" And she gave a little laugh. [MASK] fancied there was a tremor in her voice; he was touched, shocked, mortified by it.
DaisyMiller	51	7967	7967	8018	Winterbourne	[MASK] wondered whether she was seriously wounded, and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her. He had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes.
DaisyMiller	52	8103	8097	8149	Randolph	I guess she hasn t got [MASK] to go to bed." The figure of a lady appeared at a distance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and wavering movement. Suddenly it seemed to pause. "Are you sure it is your mother?
DaisyMiller	52	8160	8110	8162	Winterbourne	The figure of a lady appeared at a distance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and wavering movement. Suddenly it seemed to pause. "Are you sure it is your mother? Can you distinguish her in this thick dusk?" [MASK] asked.
DaisyMiller	55	8238	8184	8239	Winterbourne	And when she has got on my shawl, too! She is always wearing my things." The lady in question, ceasing to advance, hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps. "I am afraid your mother doesn t see you," said [MASK].
DaisyMiller	53	8309	8265	8318	Winterbourne	"Oh, it s a fearful old thing!" the young girl replied serenely. "I told her she could wear it. She won t come here because she sees you." "Ah, then," said [MASK], "I had better leave you."
DaisyMiller	43	8466	8459	8502	Winterbourne	"To introduce me," said [MASK], "you must know my name." And he proceeded to pronounce it. "Oh, dear, I can t say all that!" said his companion with a laugh.
DaisyMiller	42	8700	8700	8742	Daisy	[MASK] was near her, pulling her shawl straight. "What are you doing, poking round here?" this young lady inquired, but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply.
DaisyMiller	53	8772	8721	8774	Daisy	this young lady inquired, but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply. "I don t know," said her mother, turning toward the lake again. "I shouldn t think you d want that shawl!" [MASK] exclaimed.
DaisyMiller	42	9066	9037	9079	Daisy	"I wish he would!" said her mother. "It seems as if he couldn t." "I think he s real tiresome," [MASK] pursued. Then, for some moments, there was silence. "
DaisyMiller	41	9183	9183	9224	Winterbourne	[MASK] took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the projected excursion; but he said to himself that she was a simple, easily managed person, and that a few deferential protestations would take the edge from her displeasure.
DaisyMiller	55	9345	9323	9378	Winterbourne	"I have never been to that castle." "It is a pity you shouldn t go," said [MASK], beginning to feel reassured as to her opposition. And yet he was quite prepared to find that, as a matter of course, she meant to accompany her daughter.
DaisyMiller	56	9405	9356	9412	Daisy	And yet he was quite prepared to find that, as a matter of course, she meant to accompany her daughter. "We ve been thinking ever so much about going," she pursued; "but it seems as if we couldn t. Of course [MASK]--she wants to go round.
DaisyMiller	45	9582	9582	9627	Winterbourne	[MASK] declared. And he desired more and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a tete-a-tete with the young lady, who was still strolling along in front of them, softly vocalizing.
DaisyMiller	48	9647	9628	9676	Daisy	"You are not disposed, madam," he inquired, "to undertake it yourself?" [MASK] s mother looked at him an instant askance, and then walked forward in silence. Then--"I guess she had better go alone," she said simply.
DaisyMiller	53	9677	9664	9717	Winterbourne	Then--"I guess she had better go alone," she said simply. [MASK] observed to himself that this was a very different type of maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of the lake.
DaisyMiller	56	9809	9795	9851	Winterbourne	"I beg you, madam, to let her go," said [MASK] ardently; for he had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl. "I shouldn t think she d want to," said her mother.
DaisyMiller	49	9953	9920	9969	Winterbourne	"You haven t spoken to me for half an hour," her daughter went on. "I have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother," said [MASK]. "Well, I want you to take me out in a boat!"
DaisyMiller	43	10022	10010	10053	Winterbourne	No; it s impossible to be prettier than that, thought [MASK]. "There are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place," he said, pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake.
DaisyMiller	50	10077	10054	10104	Daisy	"If you will do me the honor to accept my arm, we will go and select one of them." [MASK] stood there smiling; she threw back her head and gave a little, light laugh. "I like a gentleman to be formal!"
DaisyMiller	47	10208	10174	10221	Daisy	"Do, then, let me give you a row," he said to the young girl. "It s quite lovely, the way you say that!" cried [MASK]. "It will be still more lovely to do it."
DaisyMiller	45	10232	10222	10267	Daisy	"Yes, it would be lovely!" said [MASK]. But she made no movement to accompany him; she only stood there laughing. "I should think you had better find out what time it is," interposed her mother.
DaisyMiller	48	10294	10268	10316	Winterbourne	"It is eleven o clock, madam," said a voice, with a foreign accent, out of the neighboring darkness; and [MASK], turning, perceived the florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies. He had apparently just approached.
DaisyMiller	47	10556	10531	10578	Winterbourne	"I don t care to go now." "I myself shall make a fuss if you don t go," said [MASK]. "That s all I want--a little fuss!" And the young girl began to laugh again.
DaisyMiller	48	10753	10713	10761	deucedly	He lingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour, turning over the mystery of the young girl s sudden familiarities and caprices. But the only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy [MASK] "going off" with her somewhere.
DaisyMiller	47	10851	10851	10898	Winterbourne	[MASK] was a man of imagination and, as our ancestors used to say, sensibility; as he looked at her dress and, on the great staircase, her little rapid, confiding step, he felt as if there were something romantic going forward.
DaisyMiller	52	11149	11138	11190	Winterbourne	People continued to look at her a great deal, and [MASK] took much satisfaction in his pretty companion s distinguished air. He had been a little afraid that she would talk loud, laugh overmuch, and even, perhaps, desire to move about the boat a good deal.
DaisyMiller	50	11313	11270	11320	Winterbourne	Her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast, but every now and then it took a subjective turn. "What on EARTH are you so grave about?" she suddenly demanded, fixing her agreeable eyes upon [MASK] s. "Am I grave?"
DaisyMiller	43	11559	11537	11580	Winterbourne	They had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian; and [MASK] arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurried--that they should linger and pause wherever they chose.
DaisyMiller	53	12007	11995	12048	Winterbourne--"just	"Oh, don t say such dreadful things!" said [MASK] at the last!" "The last!" cried the young girl; "I call it the first. I have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone."
DaisyMiller	55	12154	12154	12209	Winterbourne	[MASK], who denied the existence of such a person, was quite unable to discover, and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage. She seemed to him, in all this, an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity. "
DaisyMiller	48	12225	12210	12258	Daisy	Does she never allow you more than three days at a time?" asked [MASK] ironically. "Doesn t she give you a vacation in summer? There s no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season.
DaisyMiller	58	12297	12277	12335	Winterbourne	Do wait over till Friday, and I will go down to the landing to see her arrive!" [MASK] began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked. If he had missed the personal accent, the personal accent was now making its appearance.
DaisyMiller	46	12422	12408	12454	Daisy	"I don t want you to come for your aunt," said [MASK]; "I want you to come for me." And this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman.
DaisyMiller	49	12851	12851	12900	Winterbourne	[MASK] demanded. "The girl goes about alone with her foreigners. As to what happens further, you must apply elsewhere for information. She has picked up half a dozen of the regular Roman fortune hunters, and she takes them about to people s houses.
DaisyMiller	51	12948	12901	12952	Winterbourne	When she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache." "And where is the mother?" "I haven t the least idea. They are very dreadful people." [MASK] meditated a moment.
DaisyMiller	46	13413	13388	13434	Daisy	"I am much obliged to you," laughed the young man. "You might have come to see me!" said [MASK]. "I arrived only yesterday." "I don t believe that!" the young girl declared.
DaisyMiller	48	13435	13415	13463	Winterbourne	"I arrived only yesterday." "I don t believe that!" the young girl declared. [MASK] turned with a protesting smile to her mother, but this lady evaded his glance, and, seating herself, fixed her eyes upon her son.
DaisyMiller	53	13965	13913	13966	Winterbourne	"We had heard so much about it; I suppose we had heard too much. But we couldn t help that. We had been led to expect something different." "Ah, wait a little, and you will become very fond of it," said [MASK].
DaisyMiller	46	15444	15409	15455	Winterbourne	As the day was splendid, however, and the concourse of vehicles, walkers, and loungers numerous, the young Americans found their progress much delayed. This fact was highly agreeable to [MASK], in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation.
DaisyMiller	52	15493	15456	15508	Daisy	The slow-moving, idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm; and he wondered what on earth had been in [MASK] s mind when she proposed to expose herself, unattended, to its appreciation.
DaisyMiller	44	15560	15548	15592	Daisy	"Why haven t you been to see me?" asked [MASK]. "You can t get out of that." "I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out of the train."
DaisyMiller	58	16071	16052	16110	Winterbourne	He s staring at the women in the carriages: did you ever see anything so cool?" [MASK] perceived at some distance a little man standing with folded arms nursing his cane. He had a handsome face, an artfully poised hat, a glass in one eye, and a nosegay in his buttonhole.
DaisyMiller	53	16111	16087	16140	Winterbourne	He had a handsome face, an artfully poised hat, a glass in one eye, and a nosegay in his buttonhole. [MASK] looked at him a moment and then said, "Do you mean to speak to that man?" "Do I mean to speak to him?
DaisyMiller	42	16163	16132	16174	Winterbourne	"Do I mean to speak to him? Why, you don t suppose I mean to communicate by signs?" "Pray understand, then," said [MASK], "that I intend to remain with you."
DaisyMiller	45	16175	16175	16220	Daisy	[MASK] stopped and looked at him, without a sign of troubled consciousness in her face, with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her happy dimples. "Well, she s a cool one!" thought the young man.
DaisyMiller	47	16234	16206	16253	Daisy	"Well, she s a cool one!" thought the young man. "I don t like the way you say that," said [MASK]. "It s too imperious." "I beg your pardon if I say it wrong.
DaisyMiller	51	16318	16268	16319	Winterbourne	The young girl looked at him more gravely, but with eyes that were prettier than ever. "I have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me, or to interfere with anything I do." "I think you have made a mistake," said [MASK].
DaisyMiller	47	16586	16571	16618	Winterbourne	But he kept his temper in a manner which suggested far-stretching intentions. [MASK] flattered himself that he had taken his measure. "He is not a gentleman," said the young American; "he is only a clever imitation of one.
DaisyMiller	52	16711	16691	16743	Winterbourne	It was true that, if he was an imitation, the imitation was brilliant. "Nevertheless," [MASK] said to himself, "a nice girl ought to know!" And then he came back to the question whether this was, in fact, a nice girl.
DaisyMiller	50	17113	17096	17146	Winterbourne	She must not walk here with you two men. Fifty people have noticed her." [MASK] raised his eyebrows. "I think it s a pity to make too much fuss about it." "It s a pity to let the girl ruin herself!"
DaisyMiller	54	17250	17199	17253	Winterbourne	It seemed too pitiful, not even to attempt to save her. I ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet, and came here as quickly as possible. Thank Heaven I have found you!" "What do you propose to do with us?" asked [MASK], smiling.
DaisyMiller	58	17465	17425	17483	Daisy	"I am glad you admire it," said this lady, smiling sweetly. "Will you get in and let me put it over you?" "Oh, no, thank you," said [MASK]. "I shall admire it much more as I see you driving round with it."
DaisyMiller	50	17621	17621	17671	Winterbourne	[MASK] saw that she scented interference. "My mother never walked ten steps in her life. And then, you know," she added with a laugh, "I am more than five years old." "You are old enough to be more reasonable.
DaisyMiller	53	18396	18362	18415	Winterbourne	"If she is so perfectly determined to compromise herself, the sooner one knows it the better; one can act accordingly." "I suspect she meant no harm," [MASK] rejoined. "So I thought a month ago. But she has been going too far."
DaisyMiller	50	18728	18716	18766	Winterbourne	"I m afraid I can t do that," said [MASK]. "I like her extremely." "All the more reason that you shouldn t help her to make a scandal." "There shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her."
DaisyMiller	50	18900	18887	18937	Winterbourne	At the same moment these persons rose and walked toward the parapet. [MASK] had asked the coachman to stop; he now descended from the carriage. His companion looked at him a moment in silence; then, while he raised his hat, she drove majestically away.
DaisyMiller	56	18996	18953	19009	Giovanelli	They evidently saw no one; they were too deeply occupied with each other. When they reached the low garden wall, they stood a moment looking off at the great flat-topped pine clusters of the Villa Borghese; then [MASK] seated himself, familiarly, upon the broad ledge of the wall.
DaisyMiller	51	19081	19044	19095	Winterbourne	She came a little nearer, and he held the parasol over her; then, still holding it, he let it rest upon her shoulder, so that both of their heads were hidden from [MASK]. This young man lingered a moment, then he began to walk.
DaisyMiller	51	19654	19629	19680	Daisy	It s her revenge for my having ventured to remonstrate with her. When she comes, I shall not speak to her." [MASK] came after eleven o clock; but she was not, on such an occasion, a young lady to wait to be spoken to.
DaisyMiller	50	19824	19821	19871	Daisy	Of all this [MASK] delivered herself with the sweetest, brightest audibleness, looking now at her hostess and now round the room, while she gave a series of little pats, round her shoulders, to the edges of her dress. "Is there anyone I know?
DaisyMiller	55	20202	20170	20225	Winterbourne	It would have been most unkind; he had been talking about that walk for ten days." "He should not have talked about it at all," said [MASK]; "he would never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about the streets with him."
DaisyMiller	51	20326	20277	20328	Winterbourne	The young ladies of this country have a dreadfully poky time of it, so far as I can learn; I don t see why I should change my habits for THEM." "I am afraid your habits are those of a flirt," said [MASK] gravely.
DaisyMiller	53	20408	20356	20409	Winterbourne	Did you ever hear of a nice girl that was not? But I suppose you will tell me now that I am not a nice girl." "You re a very nice girl; but I wish you would flirt with me, and me only," said [MASK].
DaisyMiller	49	20458	20410	20459	Winterbourne	"Ah! thank you--thank you very much; you are the last man I should think of flirting with. As I have had the pleasure of informing you, you are too stiff." "You say that too often," said [MASK].
DaisyMiller	41	20460	20460	20501	Daisy	[MASK] gave a delighted laugh. "If I could have the sweet hope of making you angry, I should say it again." "Don t do that; when I am angry I m stiffer than ever.
DaisyMiller	46	20547	20502	20548	Daisy	But if you won t flirt with me, do cease, at least, to flirt with your friend at the piano; they don t understand that sort of thing here." "I thought they understood nothing else!" exclaimed [MASK].
DaisyMiller	47	20671	20659	20706	Daisy	"He isn t preaching, at any rate," said [MASK] with vivacity. "And if you want very much to know, we are neither of us flirting; we are too good friends for that: we are very intimate friends."
DaisyMiller	54	20712	20675	20729	Winterbourne	"And if you want very much to know, we are neither of us flirting; we are too good friends for that: we are very intimate friends." "Ah!" rejoined [MASK], "if you are in love with each other, it is another affair."
DaisyMiller	46	21373	21361	21407	Giovanelli	She showed no displeasure at her tete-a-tete with [MASK] being interrupted; she could chatter as freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one; there was always, in her conversation, the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility.
DaisyMiller	56	21850	21845	21901	Winterbourne	"No," rejoined [MASK], with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded. "I don t believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue." "I have heard a dozen people speak of it; they say she is quite carried away by him."
DaisyMiller	48	21911	21864	21912	Winterbourne	"I don t believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue." "I have heard a dozen people speak of it; they say she is quite carried away by him." "They are certainly very intimate," said [MASK].
DaisyMiller	57	22014	21971	22028	Winterbourne	It was the courier probably who introduced him; and if he succeeds in marrying the young lady, the courier will come in for a magnificent commission." "I don t believe she thinks of marrying him," said [MASK], "and I don t believe he hopes to marry her."
DaisyMiller	47	22799	22791	22838	Winterbourne	"Who was her companion?" asked [MASK]. "A little Italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole. The girl is delightfully pretty, but I thought I understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde."
DaisyMiller	59	23281	23246	23305	Daisy	Then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant, passionate, perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced. He asked himself whether [MASK] s defiance came from the consciousness of innocence, or from her being, essentially, a young person of the reckless class.
DaisyMiller	44	23888	23854	23898	Winterbourne	"Because you think I go round too much with HIM." And she nodded at her attendant. "Every one thinks so--if you care to know," said [MASK]. "Of course I care to know!"
DaisyMiller	50	23899	23890	23940	Daisy	"Of course I care to know!" [MASK] exclaimed seriously. "But I don t believe it. They are only pretending to be shocked. They don t really care a straw what I do. Besides, I don t go round so much."
DaisyMiller	53	23958	23911	23964	Daisy	They are only pretending to be shocked. They don t really care a straw what I do. Besides, I don t go round so much." "I think you will find they do care. They will show it disagreeably." [MASK] looked at him a moment.
DaisyMiller	50	24020	23981	24031	Winterbourne	"I have noticed you. But I noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the first time I saw you." "You will find I am not so stiff as several others," said [MASK], smiling. "How shall I find it?"
DaisyMiller	47	24067	24032	24079	Daisy	"By going to see the others." "What will they do to me?" "They will give you the cold shoulder. Do you know what that means?" [MASK] was looking at him intently; she began to color. "
DaisyMiller	56	24118	24114	24170	Winterbourne	Then looking back at [MASK], "I shouldn t think you would let people be so unkind!" she said. "How can I help it?" he asked. "I should think you would say something." "I do say something;" and he paused a moment.
DaisyMiller	52	24481	24465	24517	Winterbourne	When, on his return from the villa (it was eleven o clock), [MASK] approached the dusky circle of the Colosseum, it recurred to him, as a lover of the picturesque, that the interior, in the pale moonshine, would be well worth a glance.
DaisyMiller	47	24677	24653	24700	Winterbourne	The historic atmosphere was there, certainly; but the historic atmosphere, scientifically considered, was no better than a villainous miasma. [MASK] walked to the middle of the arena, to take a more general glance, intending thereafter to make a hasty retreat.
DaisyMiller	43	24888	24874	24917	Daisy	It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of [MASK] s behavior, and the riddle had become easy to read. She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect.
DaisyMiller	44	25079	25045	25089	Winterbourne	He saw me, and he cuts me!" What a clever little reprobate she was, and how smartly she played at injured innocence! But he wouldn t cut her. [MASK] came forward again and went toward the great cross.
DaisyMiller	52	25100	25100	25152	Winterbourne	[MASK] had now begun to think simply of the craziness, from a sanitary point of view, of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria. What if she WERE a clever little reprobate? that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa.
DaisyMiller	49	25167	25142	25191	Daisy	that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa. "How long have you been here?" he asked almost brutally. [MASK], lovely in the flattering moonlight, looked at him a moment. Then--"All the evening," she answered, gently. *
DaisyMiller	49	25210	25181	25230	Winterbourne	Then--"All the evening," she answered, gently. * * * "I never saw anything so pretty." "I am afraid," said [MASK], "that you will not think Roman fever very pretty. This is the way people catch it.
DaisyMiller	52	25240	25223	25275	Giovanelli	This is the way people catch it. I wonder," he added, turning to [MASK], "that you, a native Roman, should countenance such a terrible indiscretion." "Ah," said the handsome native, "for myself I am not afraid."
DaisyMiller	47	25293	25258	25305	Giovanelli	"Ah," said the handsome native, "for myself I am not afraid." "Neither am I--for you! I am speaking for this young lady." [MASK] lifted his well-shaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant teeth.
DaisyMiller	47	25309	25306	25353	Winterbourne	But he took [MASK] s rebuke with docility. "I told the signorina it was a grave indiscretion, but when was the signorina ever prudent?" "I never was sick, and I don t mean to be!" the signorina declared.
DaisyMiller	48	25539	25514	25562	Winterbourne	Well, I HAVE seen the Colosseum by moonlight!" she exclaimed. "That s one good thing." Then, noticing [MASK] s silence, she asked him why he didn t speak. He made no answer; he only began to laugh.
DaisyMiller	48	25622	25605	25653	Winterbourne	she asked. "It doesn t matter what I believed the other day," said [MASK], still laughing. "Well, what do you believe now?" "I believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or not!"
DaisyMiller	49	25681	25637	25686	Giovanelli	"I believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or not!" He felt the young girl s pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick gloom of the archway; she was apparently going to answer. But [MASK] hurried her forward. "
DaisyMiller	46	25750	25742	25788	Daisy	"I don t care," said [MASK] in a little strange tone, "whether I have Roman fever or not!" Upon this the cab driver cracked his whip, and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement.
DaisyMiller	46	26174	26174	26220	Daisy	[MASK] spoke of you the other day," she said to him. "Half the time she doesn t know what she s saying, but that time I think she did. She gave me a message she told me to tell you.
DaisyMiller	51	26292	26277	26328	Daisy	A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for taking [MASK] round at night. Well, so I am, but I suppose he knows I m a lady. I would scorn to scold him. Anyway, she says she s not engaged.
DaisyMiller	50	26409	26387	26437	Winterbourne	Only, if she is not engaged, I m sure I m glad to know it." But, as [MASK] had said, it mattered very little. A week after this, the poor girl died; it had been a terrible case of the fever.
DaisyMiller	56	26578	26538	26594	Winterbourne	At last he said, "She was the most beautiful young lady I ever saw, and the most amiable;" and then he added in a moment, "and she was the most innocent." [MASK] looked at him and presently repeated his words, "And the most innocent?"
DaisyMiller	53	26730	26693	26746	Winterbourne	She would never have married me, I am sure." "She would never have married you?" "For a moment I hoped so. But no. I am sure." [MASK] listened to him: he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the April daisies.
DaisyMiller	43	26914	26914	26957	Winterbourne	[MASK] offered no answer to this question; but he presently said, "You were right in that remark that you made last summer. I was booked to make a mistake. I have lived too long in foreign parts."
