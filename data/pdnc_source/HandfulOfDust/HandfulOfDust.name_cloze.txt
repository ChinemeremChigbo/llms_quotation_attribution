HandfulOfDust	48	189	181	229	John	I wish you'd take to it, [MASK]. You're looking so tired lately. I don't know how I should get through my day without it." "But, mumsy, I haven't as much to do as you have."
HandfulOfDust	49	758	741	790	April	She hasn't paid for the toile-de-jouy chair covers we made her last [MASK]. I had a dull time too; didn't hold a card all the evening and came away four pounds ten to the bad." "Poor mumsy."
HandfulOfDust	48	845	832	880	Chambers	"But that's so expensive. I'm sure if we ask [MASK] she'll be able to get you something in. I thought you were certain to be out." "Well, I still may be. It isn't twelve yet."
HandfulOfDust	47	884	866	913	Beaver	"Well, I still may be. It isn't twelve yet." (Most of [MASK]'s invitations came to him at the last moment; occasionally even later, when he had already begun to eat a solitary meal from a tray... "
HandfulOfDust	48	1008	971	1019	Hetton	One of his few recent quarrels with his mother had occurred when he left a luncheon party of hers in this way.) "Where are you going for the week-end?" "[MASK]." "Who's that? I forget."
HandfulOfDust	46	1021	1011	1057	Tony	"Who's that? I forget." "[MASK] Last." "Yes, of course. She's lovely, he's rather a stick. I didn't know you knew them." "Well, I don't really.
HandfulOfDust	50	1253	1223	1273	Mumsy	I've never seen it but I've an idea it's huge and quite hideous. They've got one child at least, perhaps more." "[MASK], you are wonderful. I believe you know about everyone." "It's a great help.
HandfulOfDust	55	1415	1373	1428	Joyce	The girls were becoming quite deft, she noticed with pleasure, particularly the shorter one who was handling the crates like a man. "That's the way," she said, "you are doing very nicely, [MASK]. I'll soon get you on to something more interesting."
HandfulOfDust	48	1687	1644	1692	Bratt	You don't by any chance know where I can find him, do you?" "He's in the book but I don't suppose he'll be at home now. You might be able to get him at [MASK]'s at about one.
HandfulOfDust	43	1751	1710	1753	Beaver	Thank you so _very_ much. It _is_ kind of you. I hope you will come and see me some day. _Good_-bye." After that the telephone was silent. At one o'clock [MASK] despaired.
HandfulOfDust	44	2033	2006	2050	Beaver	He was too young to have fought in the war but these men thought he was all right; they liked him far more than they did [MASK], who, they thought, ought never to have got into the club at all.
HandfulOfDust	44	2082	2060	2104	Beaver	Well, old boy," he said. "What are you drinking?" "Nothing so far." [MASK] looked at his watch. "But I think it's time I had one. Brandy and ginger ale."
HandfulOfDust	41	2105	2089	2130	Jock	But I think it's time I had one. Brandy and ginger ale." [MASK] called to the barman and then said: "Who was the old girl you wished on me at that party last night?"
HandfulOfDust	50	2359	2311	2361	Brenda	A certain amount of bridge and backgammon and low poker with the neighbours." "Comfortable?" "Not bad. Plenty to drink. Rather a shortage of bathrooms. You can stay in bed all the morning." "I've never met [MASK]."
HandfulOfDust	48	2505	2476	2524	Beaver	"And cheaper." "Yes, and cheaper I suppose... well, I'm going down to lunch. You won't have another?" [MASK] rose to go. "Yes, I think I will." "Oh, all right.
HandfulOfDust	49	2622	2602	2651	Beaver	"Only that they keep writing to me about them from my constituency." * * * * * [MASK] went downstairs but before going into the dining-room he told the porter to ring up his home and see if there was any message for him.
HandfulOfDust	52	2824	2777	2829	Tony	The grounds are open to the public daily until sunset and the house may be viewed on application by writing. It contains some good portraits and furniture. The terrace commands a fine view._ This passage from the county Guide Book did not cause [MASK] Last any serious annoyance.
HandfulOfDust	45	3439	3425	3470	Tony	Lying in bed, in the grave ten minutes between waking and ringing, [MASK] studied these defects and resolved anew to have them put right. He wondered whether it would be easy, nowadays, to find craftsmen capable of such delicate work.
HandfulOfDust	51	3733	3733	3784	Tony	[MASK] lay for ten minutes very happily planning the renovation of his ceiling. Then he rang the bell. "Has her ladyship been called yet?" "About a quarter of an hour ago, sir." "Then I'll have breakfast in her room."
HandfulOfDust	53	3878	3877	3930	Kiss	"[MASK]." He sat by the tray at the head of the bed; she leant forward to him (a nereid emerging from fathomless depths of clear water). She turned her lips away and rubbed against his cheek like a cat. It was a way she had.
HandfulOfDust	52	4029	4003	4055	Angela	"Well, you must write the speech. I'm getting too old for the girlish one I used to give them all. And [MASK] says, will we stay for the New Year?" "That's easy. Not on her life, we won't."
HandfulOfDust	51	4172	4129	4180	Brenda	"Darling, don't be cross. I know we aren't going. I'm not making a thing about it. I just thought it might be fun to eat someone else's food for a bit." Then [MASK]'s maid brought in the other tray.
HandfulOfDust	56	4264	4215	4271	Brenda	Presently he said, "As a matter of fact I probably _can_ manage to get away that week-end." "Darling, are you sure you wouldn't hate it?" "I daresay not." While he ate his breakfast [MASK] read to him from the papers.
HandfulOfDust	44	4407	4394	4438	Rupert	"I _knew_ it. There's no such character as [MASK] in the story. I shall never read to you again." "Well, to tell you the truth I was just thinking." "Oh."
HandfulOfDust	50	4557	4549	4599	John	We've always lived here and I hope [MASK] will be able to keep it on after me. One has a duty towards one's employees, and towards the place too. It's a definite part of English life which would be a serious loss if..."
HandfulOfDust	44	4601	4568	4612	Tony	One has a duty towards one's employees, and towards the place too. It's a definite part of English life which would be a serious loss if..." Then [MASK] stopped short in his speech and looked at the bed.
HandfulOfDust	46	4613	4613	4659	Brenda	[MASK] had turned on her face and only the top of her head appeared above the sheets. "Oh God," she said into the pillow. "What have I done?" "I say, am I being pompous again?"
HandfulOfDust	49	4694	4649	4698	Brenda	"I say, am I being pompous again?" She turned sideways so that her nose and one eye emerged. "Oh no, darling, not _pompous_. You wouldn't know how." "Sorry." [MASK] sat up. "
HandfulOfDust	52	5122	5115	5167	Ben	There had been a corresponding promotion in [MASK]'s position. From being the hand who looked after the farm horses, he was now, perceptibly, assuming the air of a stud groom. The handkerchief round his neck gave place to a stock with a fox-head pin.
HandfulOfDust	59	5296	5266	5325	Thunderclap	Canter up slow and when she takes off lean forward in the saddle and you'll be over like a bird. Keep her head straight at it." [MASK] trotted forwards, cantered two paces, thought better of it and, just before the jump, fell into a trot again and swerved round the obstacle.
HandfulOfDust	46	5497	5489	5535	John	"I'm all right," said [MASK], "I think she put in a short step." "Short step my grandmother. You just opened your bloody legs and took an arser. Keep hold on to the reins next time.
HandfulOfDust	50	5549	5545	5595	John	At the third attempt [MASK] got over and found himself breathless and insecure, one stirrup swinging loose and one hand grabbing its old support in the mane, but still in the saddle. "There, how did that feel? You just skimmed over like a swallow.
HandfulOfDust	48	5786	5742	5790	John	"Oh yes; please, nanny, may I?" "You must ask mother. Come along now, you've had quite enough of horses for one day." "Can't have enough of horses," said [MASK], "ever.
HandfulOfDust	48	5896	5854	5902	John	"What does it depend on?" "Lots of things." "Tell me one of them." "On your not asking a lot of silly questions." "Silly old tart." "_[MASK]!_ How dare you?
HandfulOfDust	49	5917	5899	5948	John	How dare you? What do you mean?" Delighted by the effect of this sally, [MASK] broke away from her hand and danced in front of her, saying, "Silly old tart, silly old tart" all the way to the side entrance.
HandfulOfDust	52	6030	5983	6035	Brenda	"I am going to speak to your mother about you." "Please, nanny. I don't know what it means, but I didn't mean it." "Go straight to the nursery." * * * * * [MASK] was doing her face.
HandfulOfDust	54	6065	6065	6119	Brenda	[MASK] spat in the eye-black. "But, nanny, what exactly did he say?" "Oh, I couldn't repeat it, my lady." "Nonsense, you must tell me. Otherwise I shall be thinking it something far worse than it was."
HandfulOfDust	50	6140	6098	6148	Brenda	"Nonsense, you must tell me. Otherwise I shall be thinking it something far worse than it was." "It couldn't have been worse... he called me a silly old tart, my lady." [MASK] choked slightly into her face towel. "
HandfulOfDust	47	6363	6349	6396	Ben	"Well, he's got no business to." "I like [MASK] more than anyone in the world. And I should think he's cleverer too." "Now, you know you don't like him more than your mother."
HandfulOfDust	48	6408	6381	6429	Tony	"Now, you know you don't like him more than your mother." "Yes I do. _Far_ more." [MASK] felt that the time had come to cut out the cross talk and deliver the homily he had been preparing.
HandfulOfDust	52	6434	6430	6482	John	"Now listen, [MASK]. It was very wrong of you to call nanny a silly old tart. First, because it was unkind to her. Think of all the things she does for you every day." "She's paid to." "Be quiet.
HandfulOfDust	50	6571	6536	6586	Ben	You must learn to speak like someone who is going to have these things and to be considerate to people less fortunate than you, particularly women. Do you understand?" "Is [MASK] less fortunate than me?" "That has nothing to do with it.
HandfulOfDust	41	6674	6638	6679	John	"To-morrow's Sunday." "Well, next day then." "But you said "to-morrow". It isn't fair to change now." "[MASK], don't argue.
HandfulOfDust	50	6779	6764	6814	John	Now run off and say you're sorry to nanny." At the door [MASK] said, "It's all right riding on Monday, isn't it? You did _say_ "to-morrow"." "Yes, I suppose so."
HandfulOfDust	51	6818	6795	6846	Thunderclap	You did _say_ "to-morrow"." "Yes, I suppose so." "Hooray. [MASK] went very well to-day. We jumped a big post and rail. She refused first time but went like a bird after that."
HandfulOfDust	52	6863	6826	6878	Thunderclap	We jumped a big post and rail. She refused first time but went like a bird after that." "Didn't you come off?" "Yes, once. It wasn't [MASK]'s fault. I just opened my bloody legs and cut an arser."
HandfulOfDust	48	6911	6895	6943	Ben	"Bad. Rotten bad." "The trouble is that nanny's jealous of [MASK]." "I'm not sure we shan't both be soon." They lunched at a small, round table in the centre of the dining-hall.
HandfulOfDust	56	6983	6944	7000	Brenda	There seemed no way of securing an even temperature in that room; even when one side was painfully roasting in the direct blaze of the open hearth, the other was numbed by a dozen converging draughts. [MASK] had tried numerous experiments with screens and a portable electric radiator, but with little success.
HandfulOfDust	49	7188	7159	7208	J	"Yes, darling, and when we get tired of it we might try an alphabetical diet, having things beginning with a different letter every day. [MASK] would be hungry, nothing but jam and jellied eels... What are your plans for the afternoon?"
HandfulOfDust	47	7414	7406	7453	Beaver	_" And asked, "What's [MASK]?" "It's a young man." "That sounds all right." "Oh no it's not. Wait till you see him." "What's he coming here for?
HandfulOfDust	50	7477	7454	7504	Bratt	Did you ask him to stay?" "I suppose I did in a vague kind of way. I went to [MASK]'s one evening and he was the only chap there so we had some drinks and he said something about wanting to see the house..."
HandfulOfDust	43	7989	7989	8032	Beaver	[MASK] was well used to making conversation, so they went out together through the french windows on to the terrace, down the steps, into the Dutch garden, and back round the orangery without suffering a moment's real embarrassment.
HandfulOfDust	51	8364	8350	8401	Ben	Do you hunt?" "Not for a long time." "[MASK] says it stands to reason everyone ought to hunt who can afford to, for the good of the country." "Perhaps I can't afford to." "Are you poor?"
HandfulOfDust	49	8460	8417	8466	John	"Yes, very poor." "Poor enough to call people tarts?" "Yes, quite poor enough." "How did you get poor?" "I always have been." "Oh." [MASK] lost interest in this topic.
HandfulOfDust	51	8510	8504	8555	Brenda	"Oh dear," said [MASK], "what would nanny say if she heard you talking like that?" "How old are you?" "Twenty-five. How old are you?" "What do you do?" "Nothing much."
HandfulOfDust	55	8701	8683	8738	John	He's got a silly voice and a silly face, silly eyes and silly nose," [MASK]'s voice fell into a liturgical sing-song, "silly feet and silly toes, silly head and silly clothes..." "Now you eat up your supper," said nanny.)
HandfulOfDust	52	8816	8787	8839	Beaver	You were heavenly to him." She said, "Oh, it wasn't bad really. He's rather pathetic." Farther down the passage [MASK] examined his room, with the care of an experienced guest. There was no reading lamp. The inkpot was dry.
HandfulOfDust	44	8951	8944	8988	Beaver	Nor, as it happened, did [MASK], but he was glad that it was there. It was decanted into a tall jug and was carried round the little table, between the three of them, as a pledge of hospitality.
HandfulOfDust	47	9129	9084	9131	Beaver	"May I ring?" "Certainly. Got everything you want?" "Yes, thanks. Good night." "Good night." But when he got back he said, "You know, I feel awful about [MASK]."
HandfulOfDust	44	9366	9360	9404	Tony	On Christmas Day and Harvest Thanksgiving [MASK] read the lessons from the back of the brass eagle. When service was over he stood for a few minutes at the porch chatting affably with the vicar's sister and the people from the village.
HandfulOfDust	52	9652	9638	9690	Beaver	"I hope you slept all right?" "Beautifully," said [MASK], though his wan expression did not confirm the word. "I'm so glad. I always sleep well here myself. I say, I don't like the look of that train guide.
HandfulOfDust	49	9821	9821	9870	Beaver	[MASK] always did what was expected of him when he was staying away, even on a visit as unsatisfactory as the present one. "Oh yes, I should like to very much." "No, really, I shouldn't if I were you.
HandfulOfDust	50	9892	9858	9908	Brenda	"No, really, I shouldn't if I were you. You wouldn't enjoy it. I only go because I more or less have to. You stay here. [MASK] will be down directly. Ring for a drink when you feel like it."
HandfulOfDust	54	9923	9898	9952	Tony	Ring for a drink when you feel like it." "Oh, all right." "See you later then." [MASK] took his hat and stick from the lobby and let himself out. "Now I've behaved inhospitably to that young man again," he reflected.
HandfulOfDust	49	10230	10223	10272	Tony	The service followed its course. As [MASK] inhaled the agreeable, slightly musty atmosphere and performed the familiar motions of sitting, standing and leaning forward, his thoughts drifted from subject to subject, among the events of the past week and his plans for the future.
HandfulOfDust	49	10806	10780	10829	Vicar	"No, nothing serious." This was the invariable formula when he appeared at church without her. "A most interesting sermon, [MASK]." "My dear boy, I'm delighted to hear you say so. It is one of my favourites.
HandfulOfDust	53	11232	11193	11246	Brenda	Shafts of November sunshine streamed down from lancet and oriel, tinctured in green and gold, gules and azure by the emblazoned coats, broken by the leaded devices into countless points and patches of coloured light. [MASK] descended the great staircase step by step through alternations of dusk and rainbow.
HandfulOfDust	49	11297	11297	11346	Beaver	[MASK] emerged from the shadows below and stood at the foot of the stairs looking up at her. "I say, can't I carry something?" "No thanks, I've got everything safe. How did you sleep?" "Beautifully."
HandfulOfDust	50	11420	11389	11439	Tony	People so seldom do. It is very sad because it's such fun for us having them and we never make any new friends living down here." "[MASK]'s gone to church." "Yes, he likes that. He'll be back soon.
HandfulOfDust	50	11577	11528	11578	Beast	I can't tell if it's a man or a woman... yes, a woman... then you are going to go on a long journey across the sea, marry six dark men and have eleven children, grow a beard and die." "[MASK].
HandfulOfDust	50	11727	11682	11732	Beaver	You know that's a difference between us, that when someone's awful you just run away and hide, while I actually enjoy it--making up to them and showing off to myself how well I can do it. Besides, [MASK] isn't so bad.
HandfulOfDust	48	11817	11817	11865	Beaver	[MASK] was well practised in the art of being shown over houses; he had been brought up to it in fact, ever since he had begun to accompany his mother, whose hobby it had always been, and later, with changing circumstances, profession.
HandfulOfDust	52	12462	12462	12514	Tony	[MASK] joined them for tea. "I don't want to seem inhospitable, but if you're going to catch that train, you ought really to be getting ready." "That's all right. I've persuaded him to stay on till to-morrow."
HandfulOfDust	50	12741	12736	12786	Guinevere	Afterwards he went back to [MASK]. "Well, that's the last of _him_. You were superb, darling. I'm sure he's gone back thinking that you're mad about him." "Oh, he wasn't too awful."
HandfulOfDust	51	12950	12919	12970	Tony	"What does she want?" "Something quite simple. Two rooms and a bath. But it's all quite vague. She hasn't said anything to [MASK] yet." "I am sure I shall be able to find her something." [II]
HandfulOfDust	54	13068	13033	13087	Marjorie	She travelled third-class and the carriages were often full, because other wives on the line took advantage of the cheap fare. She usually spent the day with her younger sister, [MASK], who was married to the prospective Conservative candidate for a South London constituency of strong Labour sympathies.
HandfulOfDust	49	13473	13457	13506	Margot	What's he like?" "I hardly know him. I see him at [MASK]'s sometimes. He's a great one for going everywhere." "I thought he was rather pathetic." "Oh, he's _pathetic_ all right.
HandfulOfDust	45	13847	13819	13864	Tony	"Do come up for it. It's certain to be amusing." "I might... if I can find someone to take me. [MASK] doesn't like her... I can't go to parties alone at my age."
HandfulOfDust	47	14324	14295	14342	John	"I _must_ come and speak to you, though I'm in a great hurry. It's _so_ long since we met and [MASK] has been telling me about a _delightful_ week-end he had with you."
HandfulOfDust	51	14457	14440	14491	Brenda	Then you could hear all about it." "I _could_..." said [MASK] doubtfully. "Then _do_. I'll expect you about six. I daresay you don't know where I live?" She told her and left the table.
HandfulOfDust	48	14502	14466	14514	Marjorie	I'll expect you about six. I daresay you don't know where I live?" She told her and left the table. "What's all this about a flat?" [MASK] asked. "Oh, just something I thought of..."
HandfulOfDust	49	14757	14751	14800	Beaver	When she had to go, [MASK] came with her to the station. She usually ate some chocolate and buns in her carriage; they bought them together at the buffet. There was plenty of time before the train left and the carriage was not yet full.
HandfulOfDust	50	14801	14784	14834	Beaver	There was plenty of time before the train left and the carriage was not yet full. [MASK] came in and sat with her. "I'm sure you want to go away." "No, really." "I've got lots to read."
HandfulOfDust	47	14884	14844	14891	Polly	"It's very sweet of you." Presently she said, rather timidly, for she was not used to asking for that sort of thing, "I suppose you wouldn't like to take me to [MASK]'s party, would you?"
HandfulOfDust	52	15015	14993	15045	Brenda	"I wish I could," he said, "but I've promised to dine out for it." [MASK] had observed his hesitation. "I was afraid you would have." "But we'll meet there." "Yes, if I go."
HandfulOfDust	50	15090	15082	15132	Beaver	They were silent for a minute. Then [MASK] said, "Well, I think perhaps I'll leave you now." "Yes, run along. Thank you for coming." He went off down the platform. There were still eight minutes to go.
HandfulOfDust	49	15139	15112	15161	Brenda	Thank you for coming." He went off down the platform. There were still eight minutes to go. The carriage suddenly filled up and [MASK] felt tired out. "Why _should_ he want to take me, poor boy?" she thought.
HandfulOfDust	50	15182	15162	15212	Brenda	"Only he might have done it better." * * * * * "Barnardo case?" [MASK] nodded. "Down and out," she said, "sunk, right under." She sat nursing her bread and milk, stirring it listlessly.
HandfulOfDust	52	15232	15185	15237	Marjorie	"Down and out," she said, "sunk, right under." She sat nursing her bread and milk, stirring it listlessly. Every bit of her felt good for nothing. "Good day?" She nodded. "Saw [MASK] and her filthy dog.
HandfulOfDust	49	15308	15274	15323	Tony	They're far too much for you." "Me? Oh, I'm all right. Wish I was dead, that's all... and please, please, darling [MASK], don't say anything about bed, because I can't move."
HandfulOfDust	49	15451	15444	15493	Mummy	"Is she nice?" "[MASK] thinks so. I don't." "Why?" "Because she looks like a monkey." "I should love to see her. Does she live in a cage? Has she got a tail?
HandfulOfDust	51	15494	15460	15511	Ben	"Why?" "Because she looks like a monkey." "I should love to see her. Does she live in a cage? Has she got a tail? [MASK] saw a woman who looked like a fish, with scales all over instead of skin.
HandfulOfDust	50	15604	15593	15643	Peppermint	She became one of the inhabitants of his world, like [MASK], the mule who died of rum. When kindly people spoke to him in the village he would tell them about her and how she swung head down from a tree throwing nutshells at passers-by.
HandfulOfDust	55	15797	15791	15846	Polly	He may not even come to [MASK]'s." "Is there _any_ man you can bring?" "Can't think of anybody." "Well, we shall have to be one short, that's all. I can't think what's happened to-night.
HandfulOfDust	44	16023	15996	16040	Beaver	"Let's make him take off his coat and drink something." The two sisters were a little shy as they came downstairs, but [MASK] was perfectly at his ease. He looked very elegant and rather more than his age.
HandfulOfDust	52	16377	16368	16420	Espinosa	"Yes, where?" "I thought [MASK]'s." "Yes, lovely. Only listen. I want you to understand right away that it's _my_ dinner." "Of course not... nothing of the sort." "Yes it is.
HandfulOfDust	56	16518	16510	16566	Brenda	He said, "_Please_, [MASK]," but she turned away and looked out of the window, shaking her head several times quickly. Then, her eyes still fixed on the window, she put out her hand to his and they sat in silence till they reached the restaurant.
HandfulOfDust	43	16567	16539	16582	Beaver	Then, her eyes still fixed on the window, she put out her hand to his and they sat in silence till they reached the restaurant. [MASK] was thoroughly puzzled. Once they were in public again, his confidence returned.
HandfulOfDust	45	16583	16572	16617	Espinosa	Once they were in public again, his confidence returned. [MASK] led them to their table; it was the one by itself on the right of the door, the only table in the restaurant at which one's conversation was not overheard.
HandfulOfDust	46	16934	16908	16954	Brenda	"Oh, is this a walk out?" "Not as far as I am concerned." There was a pause in which [MASK] said, "I am not sure it hasn't been a mistake, taking you out to dinner.
HandfulOfDust	51	17045	16997	17048	Beaver	"You've got to _learn_ to be nicer," she said soberly. "I don't believe you'd find it impossible." When the bill eventually came, she said, "How much do I tip him?" and [MASK] showed her.
HandfulOfDust	50	17153	17109	17159	Brenda	But he decided it was time she took the lead. So he sat at a distance from her and commented on an old house that was being demolished to make way for a block of flats. "Shut up," said [MASK]. "Come here."
HandfulOfDust	49	17182	17177	17226	Polly	* * * * * [MASK]'s party was exactly what she wished it to be, an accurate replica of all the best parties she had been to in the last year; the same band, the same supper and, above all, the same guests.
HandfulOfDust	55	17298	17262	17317	Polly	She wanted a perfectly straight, smart party and she had got it. Practically everyone she asked had come. If there were other, more remote worlds upon which she did not impinge, [MASK] did not know about them. These were the people she was after, and here they were.
HandfulOfDust	58	17488	17442	17500	Brenda	People who, only eighteen months before, would have pretended to be ignorant of her existence were now crowding up her stairs. She had got herself in line with the other married women of her world. As they started to go up, [MASK] said, "You're not to leave me, please.
HandfulOfDust	41	17511	17501	17542	Beaver	I'm not going to know anybody," and [MASK] again saw himself as the dominant male. They went straight through to the band and began dancing, not talking much except to greet other couples whom they knew.
HandfulOfDust	58	17644	17602	17660	Brenda	He had been there a long time, talking sometimes to the couples who came in and out, but always ending up alone. He was not enjoying the evening and he told himself rather resentfully that it was because of [MASK]; if he had come there in a large party it would have been different.
HandfulOfDust	52	17661	17661	17713	Brenda	[MASK] saw he was out of temper and said, "Time for supper." It was early, and the tables were mostly empty except for earnest couples sitting alone. There was a large round table between the windows, with no one at it; they sat there.
HandfulOfDust	49	17959	17953	18002	Brenda	"Oh dear," said [MASK], "now we're done. We can't go back to the table... it almost looks as though we should have to go home." "It's not two." "That's late for me.
HandfulOfDust	51	18026	17976	18027	Beaver	it almost looks as though we should have to go home." "It's not two." "That's late for me. Look here, don't you come. Stay and enjoy yourself." "Of course I'll come," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	51	18156	18118	18169	Beaver	"Well, good night, my dear. Thank you a thousand times for looking after me. I'm afraid I rather bitched your evening." "No, of course not," said [MASK]. "Will you ring me in the morning... promise?"
HandfulOfDust	43	18184	18158	18201	Beaver	"Will you ring me in the morning... promise?" She touched her hand to her lips and then turned to the keyhole. [MASK] hesitated a minute whether he should go back to the party, but decided not to.
HandfulOfDust	50	18286	18278	18328	Polly	I thought you must have gone back to [MASK]'s. Is the telephone not by your bed?" "No, it's on the ground floor." "Oh dear, then it wasn't a very good idea to ring up, was it?"
HandfulOfDust	50	18403	18403	18453	Beaver	[MASK] went up the two flights of stairs again, and got into bed. * * * * * "...going away in the middle of the party." "I can't tell you how innocent it was. He didn't even come in."
HandfulOfDust	55	18571	18567	18622	Brenda	But, really, [MASK], he's such a _dreary_ young man." "I know it all. He's second rate and a snob and, I should think, as cold as a fish, but I happen to have a fancy for him, that's all...
HandfulOfDust	55	18755	18719	18774	Brenda	"Oh dear, I see you're very serious." The telephone rang. "Perhaps _that's_ him." But a familiar voice rang out from the instrument so that [MASK] could hear it, "Good morning, darling, what's the dirt to-day?"
HandfulOfDust	49	18836	18818	18867	Polly	"How long has _that_ been on?" "There's nothing doing there, [MASK]." "Don't you tell me. They were well away last night. How's the boy managed it? That's what I want to know.
HandfulOfDust	41	18881	18846	18887	Polly	They were well away last night. How's the boy managed it? That's what I want to know. He must have something we didn't know about..." "So [MASK]'s on to your story.
HandfulOfDust	49	19231	19214	19263	Brenda	You're getting to be an old bachelor already at twenty-five. I could see [MASK] liked you, that evening she came here." "Oh, she likes me all right." "I hope she makes up her mind about that flat.
HandfulOfDust	50	19328	19316	19366	Chambers	I'm away for two nights by the way. See that [MASK] looks after you properly. There are some Australians Sylvia Newport discovered who want to take a house in the country, so I'm driving them round to one or two that might do for them.
HandfulOfDust	43	19374	19334	19377	Margot	There are some Australians Sylvia Newport discovered who want to take a house in the country, so I'm driving them round to one or two that might do for them. Where are you lunching?" "[MASK]'s."
HandfulOfDust	42	19423	19417	19459	Tony	" She sent a telegram to [MASK] to expect her by the afternoon train and, in a small voice, ordered her things to be packed. "I don't seem to have anywhere to lunch," she said.
HandfulOfDust	42	19467	19445	19487	Margot	"I don't seem to have anywhere to lunch," she said. "Why don't you come to [MASK]'s? I know she'd love it." "Well, ring up and ask her."
HandfulOfDust	54	19718	19675	19729	Tony	They wandered about the station looking at things, and bought some chocolate from a slot machine. The stationmaster came out to talk to them. "Her ladyship coming back to-day?" He was an old friend of [MASK]'s. "I've been expecting her every day.
HandfulOfDust	46	19782	19758	19804	Brenda	Had to go up and fetch her himself. And then she give him a hiding." Presently the train came in and [MASK] emerged exquisitely from her third-class carriage. "You've _both_ come. What angels you are.
HandfulOfDust	49	19849	19805	19854	Polly	I don't at all deserve it." "Oh, mummy, have you brought the monkey-lady?" "What _does_ the child mean?" "He's got it into his head that your chum [MASK] has a tail."
HandfulOfDust	57	20024	19968	20025	Tony	and he sat quite still and then went away into the wood and I began drawing a picture of a battle only I couldn't finish it because the paints weren't right and the grey carthorse the one that had worms is quite well again." "Nothing much has happened," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	50	20168	20162	20212	Tony	"Go on." "[MASK], I've found a flat." "Well, you'd better lose it again, quick." "All right. I'll attack you about it again later. Meanwhile, try not to brood about it."
HandfulOfDust	54	20302	20262	20316	Brenda	"I suppose all this means that you're going to start again about your flat?" "Mmmm." "You haven't signed any papers yet, have you?" "Oh no." [MASK] shook her head emphatically. "Then no great harm's done."
HandfulOfDust	48	20324	20324	20372	Brenda	[MASK] knelt on the sofa, sitting back on her heels. "Listen, you haven't been brooding?" "No." "Because, you see, when you say 'flat' you're thinking of something quite different to me. _
HandfulOfDust	57	20428	20373	20430	Tony	You_ mean by a flat, a lift and a man in uniform, and a big front door with knobs, and an entrance hall and doors opening in all directions, with kitchens and sculleries and dining-rooms and drawing-rooms and servants' bedrooms... don't you, [MASK]?"
HandfulOfDust	41	21128	21098	21139	Allan	"And if there's a row--" "There won't be a row." "You never know. If there is, I don't want [MASK] to think I've been helping to arrange things."
HandfulOfDust	49	21246	21222	21271	Brenda	It had been an autumn of very sparse and meagre romance; only the most obvious people had parted or come together, and [MASK] was filling a want long felt by those whose simple, vicarious pleasure it was to discuss the subject in bed over the telephone.
HandfulOfDust	49	21869	21862	21911	Hetton	That evening as usual she telephoned to [MASK]. "I'm talking from the flat." "Oh, ah." "_Darling_, do try to sound interested. It's very exciting for me." "What's it like?"
HandfulOfDust	54	22002	21993	22047	Tony	"You don't say so." "[MASK], you must be nice about it. It's all so exciting--front door and a latch-key and all... And someone sent me a lot of flowers to-day--so many that there's hardly room for them
HandfulOfDust	50	22085	22048	22098	Darling	and I've had to put them in the basin on account of having no pots. It wasn't you, was it?" "Yes... as a matter of fact." "[MASK], I did so hope it was... how like you."
HandfulOfDust	51	22141	22120	22171	Beaver	"Almost at once. Good night, my sweet." "What a lot of talk," said [MASK]. All the time that she was speaking, she had been kept busy with one hand warding him off the telephone, which he threatened playfully to disconnect.
HandfulOfDust	41	22178	22143	22184	Tony	All the time that she was speaking, she had been kept busy with one hand warding him off the telephone, which he threatened playfully to disconnect. "Wasn't it sweet of [MASK] to send those flowers?"
HandfulOfDust	49	22192	22185	22234	Tony	"I'm not awfully fond of [MASK]." "Don't let that worry you, my beauty, he doesn't like you _at all_." "_Doesn't_ he? Why not?" "No one does except me.
HandfulOfDust	57	22418	22418	22475	Allan	[MASK] always brought a large cro?te of foie gras, a delicacy of which he was particularly fond. Everyone ate a great deal and became slightly torpid towards Boxing-day evening; silver ladles of burning brandy went round the table, crackers were pulled and opened; paper hats, indoor fireworks, mottoes.
HandfulOfDust	55	22644	22636	22691	Bethlehem	Instead of the placid ox and ass of [MASK]," said the vicar, slightly losing the thread of his comparisons, "we have for companions the ravening tiger and the exotic camel, the furtive jackal and the ponderous elephant..." And so on, through the pages of faded manuscript.
HandfulOfDust	48	23111	23099	23147	Brenda	On Tuesday a letter came from him thanking her. _Darling [MASK]_, he wrote. _Thank you so very much for the charming Christmas present. You can imagine my delight when I saw the pink leather case and my surprise at opening it.
HandfulOfDust	46	23246	23236	23282	Beaver	It ended there at the bottom of a page. [MASK] had been writing it before dinner and later had put it in the envelope without remembering to finish it. He wrote a large, school-girlish hand with wide spaces between the lines.
HandfulOfDust	50	23475	23467	23517	Beaver	"Who?" "Our old friend [MASK]." "Why's that odd particularly?" "Oh, I don't know. I'd forgotten all about him, hadn't you? D'you think he sent a telegram as he did to us?"
HandfulOfDust	48	23637	23597	23645	Beaver	"You never told me who was behind your flat. I might not have been so amiable if I'd known." "No, darling, that's why." Half the house party wondered why [MASK] was there; the other half knew.
HandfulOfDust	45	23774	23762	23807	Tony	Next morning, while they were having breakfast, she said to [MASK], "I've made a New Year resolution." "Anything to do with spending more time at home?" "Oh no, _quite_ the reverse.
HandfulOfDust	49	23810	23798	23847	Tony	"Oh no, _quite_ the reverse. Listen, [MASK], it's serious. I think I'll take a course of something." "Not bone-setters again? I thought that was over." "No, something like economics.
HandfulOfDust	44	24001	23993	24037	Bratt	[I] It is not uncommon at [MASK]'s Club, between nine and ten in the evening, to find men in white ties and tail coats sitting by themselves and eating, in evident low spirits, large and extravagant dinners.
HandfulOfDust	58	24210	24210	24268	Jock	[MASK] found him seated in a corner; he was in day clothes; the table and the chair at his side were littered with papers and magazines; one was propped up in front of him. He was half-way through dinner and three-quarters of the way through a bottle of Burgundy. "
HandfulOfDust	56	24339	24333	24389	Tony	"Been chucked?" asked [MASK] again. "Yes, it's the last time I ask that bitch out." "Better have a drink. I've been drinking a whole lot. Much the best thing." They took what was left of the Burgundy and ordered another bottle.
HandfulOfDust	49	24400	24357	24406	Tony	"Better have a drink. I've been drinking a whole lot. Much the best thing." They took what was left of the Burgundy and ordered another bottle. "Just come up for the night," said [MASK]. "Staying here."
HandfulOfDust	52	24423	24407	24459	Brenda	"You've got a flat now, haven't you?" "Well, [MASK] has. There isn't really room for two... we tried it once and it wasn't a success." "What's she doing to-night?" "Out somewhere.
HandfulOfDust	49	24563	24558	24607	Tony	They drank a lot. [MASK] did most of the talking. "Extraordinary idea of hers, taking up economics," he said. "I never thought it would last, but she seems really keen on it... I suppose it's a good plan.
HandfulOfDust	51	24661	24625	24676	Brenda	Of course she'd rather die than admit it, but I believe she got a bit bored there sometimes. I've been thinking it over and that's the conclusion I came to. [MASK] must have been bored... Daresay she'll get bored with economics some time...
HandfulOfDust	51	24713	24705	24756	Brenda	I don't seem to get on with [MASK]'s new friends." "People from the school of economics?" "No, but ones I don't know. I believe I bore them. Thinking it over, that's the conclusion I've come to.
HandfulOfDust	49	24772	24744	24793	John	Thinking it over, that's the conclusion I've come to. I bore them. They talk about me as "the old boy". [MASK] heard them." "Well, that's friendly enough." "Yes, that's friendly."
HandfulOfDust	52	24867	24830	24882	Jock	"Wish you would. I don't see many old friends... Sure to be lots of people in the house, but you won't mind that, will you?... sociable chap, [MASK]... doesn't mind people about. _I_ mind it like hell.
HandfulOfDust	50	24890	24875	24925	Tony	_I_ mind it like hell." They drank some more port. [MASK] said, "Not enough bathrooms, you know... but of course you know. You've been there before, often. Not like the new friends who think me a bore.
HandfulOfDust	51	24984	24946	24997	Brenda	"Not even when I'm tight, like this?... There would have been bathrooms. I had the plans out. Four new ones. A chap down there made the plans... but then [MASK] wanted the flat so I had to postpone them as an economy...
HandfulOfDust	48	25054	25043	25091	Constituents	"I am rather. Worried about the Pig Scheme. [MASK] keep writing." "_I_ felt low, _bloody_ low, but I'm all right again now. The best thing is to get tight. That's what I did
HandfulOfDust	51	25430	25395	25446	Beaver	"That's right." "Well, I want to speak to her." "Good night," said the voice. "The old boy's plastered," said [MASK] as he rang off. "Oh dear. I feel rather awful about him.
HandfulOfDust	51	25574	25560	25611	Jock	Are you having a lovely evening?" "Hellish. I'm with [MASK]. He's worried about the Pig Scheme. Shall we come round and see you?" "No, not now, darling, I'm terribly tired and just going to bed."
HandfulOfDust	50	25622	25584	25634	Tony	Shall we come round and see you?" "No, not now, darling, I'm terribly tired and just going to bed." "We'll come and see you." "[MASK], are you a tiny bit tight?" "Stinking.
HandfulOfDust	44	25692	25691	25735	Tony	"[MASK], listen, will you please not come, not to-night. Be a good boy and stay at the club. Will you _please_ not?" "Shan't be long." He rang off.
HandfulOfDust	49	26003	25961	26010	John	Are you tight too?" "A little bit." "Oh dear, can I trust you?" "I'll try." "Well, it doesn't sound too good. Good-bye... [MASK], you've got to go.
HandfulOfDust	49	26082	26037	26086	Brenda	* * * * * "Was that your girl?" "Yes." "Made it up?" "Not exactly." "Far better to make it up. Shall we have some more brandy or go round to [MASK] straight away?"
HandfulOfDust	49	26097	26087	26136	Jock	"Let's have some more brandy." "[MASK], you aren't still feeling low, are you? Doesn't do to feel low. _I'm_ not feeling low. I _was_, but I'm not any more."
HandfulOfDust	50	26158	26116	26166	Brenda	_I'm_ not feeling low. I _was_, but I'm not any more." "No, I'm not feeling low." "Then we'll have some brandy and then go to [MASK]'s." "All right."
HandfulOfDust	51	26174	26162	26213	Jock	"All right." Half an hour later they got into [MASK]'s car. "Tell you what, I shouldn't drive if I were you." "Not drive?" "No, I shouldn't drive. They'd say you were drunk."
HandfulOfDust	53	26281	26233	26286	Brenda	"Well, so I am." "Then I shouldn't drive." "Too far to walk." "We'll take a taxi." "Oh, hell, I can drive." "Or let's not go to [MASK]'s at all."
HandfulOfDust	47	26415	26411	26458	Jock	But half-way [MASK] said, "Don't let's go there. Let's go some other place. Let's go to some low joint." "All the same to me. Tell him to go to some lousy joint."
HandfulOfDust	50	26468	26426	26476	Jock	Let's go some other place. Let's go to some low joint." "All the same to me. Tell him to go to some lousy joint." "Go to some lousy joint," said [MASK], putting his head through the window.
HandfulOfDust	46	26907	26881	26927	Tony	The young ladies get in free but they have to see to it that their patrons spend money. "Last time I was here, [MASK], was the bachelor party before your wedding." "Tight that night." "Stinking."
HandfulOfDust	53	26950	26942	26995	Reggie	Broke a fruit gum machine." "[MASK] was stinking." "I say, you don't still feel low about that girl?" "I don't feel low." "Come on, we'll go downstairs." The dance-room was fairly full.
HandfulOfDust	49	27018	26970	27019	Jock	"I don't feel low." "Come on, we'll go downstairs." The dance-room was fairly full. An elderly man had joined the band and was trying to conduct it. "I like this joint," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	48	27198	27151	27199	Babs	"So-so." "Well, let's sit down." The waiter said, "Will you buy a ticket in a raffle for a box of chocolates?" "No." "Buy one for me," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	51	27242	27232	27283	Milly	"Oh, I can always tell," said [MASK]. "Your friend is too." "Yes, _he_ is." "You'd be surprised how many gentlemen come here just to talk about their wives." "He hasn't."
HandfulOfDust	51	27316	27316	27367	Babs	[MASK] said, "I think it's nice for a girl to be interested in things." The waiter said, "What will you be taking for supper?" "Why, we've only just had dinner." "How about a nice haddock?"
HandfulOfDust	50	27397	27349	27399	Milly	"Why, we've only just had dinner." "How about a nice haddock?" "I tell you what I must do is to telephone. Where is it?" "D'you mean really the telephone or the gentlemen's?" [MASK] asked.
HandfulOfDust	56	27462	27455	27511	Tony	"Oh, it's you, [MASK]. Well, what do you want?" "You recognized my voice?" "I did." "Well, I only wanted to give a message but as I am speaking to you I can give it myself, can't I?"
HandfulOfDust	50	27519	27512	27562	Jock	"Yes." "Well, [MASK] and I are terribly sorry but we can't come round this evening after all." "Oh." "You don't think it very rude, I hope, but we have a lot to attend to."
HandfulOfDust	45	27569	27537	27582	Tony	"Oh." "You don't think it very rude, I hope, but we have a lot to attend to." "That's all right, [MASK]." "Did I wake you up by any chance?"
HandfulOfDust	47	27724	27702	27749	Jock	They've more to say." "What d'you do?" "I design postmen's hats," said [MASK]. "Oh, go on." "And my friend here trains sea-lions." "Tell us another."
HandfulOfDust	49	27882	27835	27884	Tony	"All right." He came back ten minutes later. "_I_ thought she sounded rather annoyed," he reported. "But I said in the end we wouldn't come." "She may be tired," said [MASK]. "
HandfulOfDust	41	27957	27917	27958	Babs	"I say, what's this frightful piece of fish?" "The waiter said you ordered it." "Perhaps I did." "I'll give it to the club cat," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	50	28028	27990	28040	Babs	"Perhaps we ought. She sounded annoyed with us." "Let's go now and ring her up on the way out." "Aren't you coming home with us?" said [MASK]. "Not to-night, I'm afraid."
HandfulOfDust	54	28082	28050	28104	Babs	"No, we can't really." "All right. Well, how about a little present? We're professional dancing partners, you know," said [MASK]. "Oh yes, sorry, how much?" "Oh, we leave that to the gentlemen."
HandfulOfDust	53	28263	28262	28315	Brenda	"[MASK] can't expect us to do more than that," he said. "I tell you what I'll do. I go almost past her door, so I'll ring the bell a bit just in case she's awake and still waiting up for us."
HandfulOfDust	54	28330	28278	28332	Jock	"I tell you what I'll do. I go almost past her door, so I'll ring the bell a bit just in case she's awake and still waiting up for us." "Yes, you do that. What a good friend you are, [MASK]."
HandfulOfDust	52	28360	28351	28403	Tony	I wish I didn't feel ill." [MASK] was awake at eight next morning, miserably articulating in his mind the fragmentary memories of the preceding night. The more he remembered, the baser his conduct appeared to him. At nine he had his bath and some tea.
HandfulOfDust	43	28413	28381	28424	Brenda	The more he remembered, the baser his conduct appeared to him. At nine he had his bath and some tea. At ten he was wondering whether he should ring [MASK] up when the difficulty was solved by her ringing him.
HandfulOfDust	41	28428	28425	28466	Tony	"Well, [MASK], how do you feel?" "Awful. I _was_ tight." "You were." "I'm feeling pretty guilty too." "I'm not surprised."
HandfulOfDust	50	28481	28451	28501	Jock	"I'm feeling pretty guilty too." "I'm not surprised." "I don't remember everything very clearly but I have the impression that [MASK] and I were rather bores." "You were." "Are you in a rage?"
HandfulOfDust	51	28516	28489	28540	Tony	"You were." "Are you in a rage?" "Well, I was last night. What made you do it, [MASK], grown up men like you two?" "We felt low." "I bet you feel lower this morning...
HandfulOfDust	51	28550	28541	28592	Jock	A box of white roses has just arrived from [MASK]." "I wish I'd thought of that." "You're such infants, both of you." "You aren't really in a rage?" "Of course I'm not, darling.
HandfulOfDust	52	28712	28662	28714	Brenda	"I see. You couldn't possibly chuck lunch or one of the lectures?" "Not possibly, darling." "I see. You are an angel to be so sweet about last night." "Nothing could have been more fortunate," [MASK] said.
HandfulOfDust	57	28719	28715	28772	Tony	"If I know [MASK], he'll be tortured with guilt for weeks to come. It was maddening last night but it was worth it. He's put himself so much in the wrong now that he won't dare to _feel_ resentful, let alone say anything, whatever I do.
HandfulOfDust	48	28820	28773	28821	Beaver	And he hasn't really enjoyed himself at all, the poor sweet, so _that's_ a good thing too. He had to learn not to make surprise visits." "You are one for making people learn things," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	50	28889	28860	28910	John	You didn't mind me coming to the station, did you? I _made_ nanny let me." "Very pleased to see you, [MASK]." "How was mummy?" "She sounded very well. I didn't see her."
HandfulOfDust	43	29218	29192	29235	John	"No, sir, I wouldn't have let him go to-day, only he went on so. Come along now, [MASK], and take off your coat. Goodness, child, where's your handkerchief?"
HandfulOfDust	54	29322	29304	29358	Ambrose	He dozed a little; then he went up to change. At dinner he said, "[MASK], when I'm alone I think in future I'll have dinner in the library." Afterwards he sat with a book in front of the fire but he was unable to read.
HandfulOfDust	54	29389	29341	29395	Brenda	Afterwards he sat with a book in front of the fire but he was unable to read. At ten o'clock he scattered the logs in the fireplace before going upstairs. He fastened the library windows and turned out the lights. That night he went into [MASK]'s empty room to sleep.
HandfulOfDust	48	29491	29468	29516	Ambrose	He dined in front of the fire in the library. He had given up the diet some weeks ago. ("[MASK], when I'm alone I don't really need a long dinner. In future I'll just have two courses.")
HandfulOfDust	41	29562	29552	29593	Jock	But there was a telegram for him next morning from [MASK], saying, _Week end impossible have to go to constituency how about one after next_. He wired back, _Delighted any time always here_.
HandfulOfDust	44	29769	29743	29787	John	In fact I think I might do without her altogether, what do you think; except she's useful for sewing. Longing to see [MASK] again. All going back Sunday evening. Keep _sober_, darling. _Try.
HandfulOfDust	52	29796	29778	29830	Tony	Keep _sober_, darling. _Try._ x x x x x x B. [MASK] found very little to occupy his time on Friday. His letters were all finished by ten o'clock. He went down to the farm but they had no business for him there.
HandfulOfDust	48	29863	29816	29864	Brenda	He went down to the farm but they had no business for him there. The duties which before had seemed so multifarious, now took up a very small part of his day; he had not realized how many hours he used to waste with [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	48	29892	29873	29921	John	The boy clearly bore him ill will for their quarrel on Wednesday; when he applauded a jump, [MASK] said, "She usually does better than this." Later, "When's mummy coming down?" "Not till to-morrow."
HandfulOfDust	51	29954	29954	30005	John	[MASK] had for weeks past been praying for this expedition. "No, thank you," he said. "I want to finish a picture I'm painting." "You can do that any time." "I want to do it this afternoon."
HandfulOfDust	48	30049	30040	30088	John	"Not with _him_," said [MASK]. "You ungrateful little bastard, that's a lousy way to speak of your dad." "And you ought not to say bastard or lousy in front of me, nanny says not."
HandfulOfDust	51	30350	30325	30376	Daisy	Don't you think it has possibilities?" "But, my angel, the _shape's_ all wrong," said [MASK], "and that chimney-piece--what is it made of, pink granite, and all the plaster work and the dado.
HandfulOfDust	52	30423	30416	30468	Veronica	I must think about it. As [MASK] says, the structure does rather limit one... you know, I think the only thing to do would be to disregard it altogether and find some treatment so definite that it _carried_ the room, if you see what I mean
HandfulOfDust	50	30752	30716	30766	Brenda	"_Living?_ Darling, you talk as though you had settled there for good." "D'you mind moving a second, sweet? I can't see properly." "[MASK], how long are you going on with this course of economics?"
HandfulOfDust	50	30809	30770	30820	Brenda	I don't know." "But you must have some idea?" "Oh, it's surprising what a lot there is to learn... I was so backward when I started..." "[MASK]..." "Now run and put on your coat.
HandfulOfDust	51	31011	31008	31059	Tony	"Why, [MASK]," she said. She was lying on the dais with her head deep back in the pillow; her face was shining with the grease she used for cleaning it; one bare arm on the quilted eiderdown, left there from turning the switch.
HandfulOfDust	58	31063	31017	31075	Tony	She was lying on the dais with her head deep back in the pillow; her face was shining with the grease she used for cleaning it; one bare arm on the quilted eiderdown, left there from turning the switch. "Why, [MASK]," she said, "I was almost asleep."
HandfulOfDust	48	31108	31085	31133	Polly	"Want to be left alone?" "So tired... and I've just drunk a lot of that stuff of [MASK]'s." "I see... well, good night." "Good night... don't mind, do you?...
HandfulOfDust	50	31267	31245	31295	John	"Splendid. We shall all be coming to her soon to solve our economic problems. But I daresay you and [MASK] miss her?" "Yes, we do rather." "Well, please give her my kindest regards." "I will indeed.
HandfulOfDust	51	31302	31302	31353	Tony	[MASK] left the church porch and made his accustomed way to the hothouses; a gardenia for himself; some almost black carnations for the ladies. When he reached the room where they were sitting there was a burst of laughter. He paused on the threshold, rather bewildered.
HandfulOfDust	47	32028	32018	32065	Polly	"You can't ever be certain," said [MASK]. "She bores my pants off, but she's a good trier." * * * * * "Is mummy coming down to-day, daddy?" "Yes."
HandfulOfDust	50	32125	32079	32129	Mummy	"What a silly name. Is she foreign?" "I don't know." "Sounds foreign, doesn't she, daddy? D'you think she won't be able to talk any English? Is she black?" "[MASK] says not."
HandfulOfDust	44	32344	32344	32388	Tony	[MASK] was in the smoking-room when she was announced; the library was now too noisy during the daytime, for there were men at work on the walls of the morning-room next door, tearing down the plaster tracery.
HandfulOfDust	50	32445	32416	32466	Tony	," she said, "what a sweet old place this is." "I'm afraid it's been restored a great deal," said [MASK]. "Ah, but its _atmosphere_. I always think that's what counts in a house.
HandfulOfDust	41	32553	32533	32574	Tony	" The Princess took off her furs and sat down on the stool before the fire, looking up at [MASK]. "D'you mind if I take off my hat?" "No, no... of course."
HandfulOfDust	49	32863	32816	32865	Teddy	I like just to curl up like a cat in front of the fire, and if you're nice to me I'll purr, and if you're cruel I shall pretend not to notice--just like a cat... Shall I purr, [MASK]?"
HandfulOfDust	49	32980	32974	33023	Teddy	"How English you are, [MASK]--so shy of talking about personal things, intimate things... I like you for that, you know. I love everything that's solid and homely and _good_ after... after all I've been through."
HandfulOfDust	50	33078	33050	33100	Tony	What a wonderful person she is. When _does_ she find the time?" "Ah, here comes tea at last," said [MASK]. "I hope you allow yourself to eat muffins. So many of our guests nowadays are on a diet.
HandfulOfDust	47	33126	33080	33127	Jenny	"I hope you allow yourself to eat muffins. So many of our guests nowadays are on a diet. I think muffins one of the few things that make the English winter endurable." "Muffins stand for so much," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	49	33302	33263	33312	Teddy	"It's my last link with the East," she said. "You've got butter on your chin." She reached for her bag, laughing. "Why, so I have. [MASK], you _might_ have told me."
HandfulOfDust	50	33342	33335	33385	John	"What a funny reason." [MASK] stayed with them for an hour, and all the time watched, fascinated. "Have you got a crown?" he asked. "How did you learn to speak English? What is that big ring made of?
HandfulOfDust	50	33415	33366	33416	Tony	he asked. "How did you learn to speak English? What is that big ring made of? Did it cost much? Why are your nails that colour? Can you ride?" She answered all his questions, sometimes enigmatically with an eye on [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	47	33699	33689	33736	Ben	"It's _very_ bad horsemanship indeed. [MASK] says so." "They're the most wonderful horsemen in the world. Everyone knows that." "Oh, no, they can't be, if they do _that_.
HandfulOfDust	50	33760	33720	33770	Ben	"Oh, no, they can't be, if they do _that_. It's one of the _worst_ things. Were they natives?" "Yes, of course." "[MASK] says natives aren't humans at all really."
HandfulOfDust	47	34020	33992	34039	Jenny	I think she's the most beautiful lady I've ever seen... D'you think she'd like to watch me have my bath?" Downstairs, [MASK] said, "What a heavenly child... I love children. That has been my great tragedy.
HandfulOfDust	51	34186	34176	34227	Nanny	Do ask her to come and say good night. [MASK] doesn't think she'd want to." "Did daddy seem to like her?" "He didn't talk much... She doesn't know anything about horses or natives but she _is_ beautiful.
HandfulOfDust	42	34354	34343	34385	Jenny	He threw the clothes back and crawled out, nestling against [MASK]. "Back to bed," she said, "or I shall spank you." "Would you do it hard? I shouldn't mind."
HandfulOfDust	46	34392	34357	34403	Brenda	Back to bed," she said, "or I shall spank you." "Would you do it hard? I shouldn't mind." "Oh dear," said [MASK], "what a terrible effect you seem to have.
HandfulOfDust	50	34418	34404	34454	nanny	He's never like this as a rule." When they had gone [MASK] threw open another window. "Poof!" she said, "making the whole place stink." "Don't you like it? _I_ think it's lovely."
HandfulOfDust	50	34620	34599	34649	Tony	"Darling, don't you like her?" The disappointment and distress in her tone were so clear that [MASK] was touched. "I don't know about not liking her exactly. She's just a joke, isn't she?" "Is she...
HandfulOfDust	50	34676	34646	34696	Tony	"Is she... oh dear... She's had a terrible life, you know." "So I gathered." "Be nice to her, [MASK], please." "Oh, I'll be nice to her. Is she a Jewess?"
HandfulOfDust	47	34811	34797	34844	Tony	"She will _go on_ so... and, after all, [MASK]'s been used to me for seven years. It's rather a sudden change." * * * * * "Tired?" "Mmm. Little bit."
HandfulOfDust	49	34869	34862	34911	Polly	I'm sorry, darling, but [MASK] takes so long to get to bed... Was it awful? I wish you liked her more." "She's awful." "One has to make allowances... she's got the most terrible scars."
HandfulOfDust	49	34943	34912	34961	Brenda	"So she told me." "I've seen them." "Besides, I hoped to see something of you." "Oh." "[MASK], you aren't angry still about my getting tight that night and waking you up?"
HandfulOfDust	50	35216	35216	35266	Mummy	[MASK] said you wouldn't be awake." "I've been awake a long time. You see I was once very badly hurt, and now I don't always sleep well. Even the softest beds are too hard for me now." "Ooh.
HandfulOfDust	49	35322	35298	35347	Johnny	It's cold with the door open. Look, there are some grapes here. Would you like to eat them?" [MASK] climbed on to the bed. "What are you going to do to-day?" "I don't know yet.
HandfulOfDust	49	35622	35583	35632	Polly	"Well, we'll see." * * * * * "She's gone to church with him. That's a good sign, isn't it?" "Well, not really, [MASK]. He likes going alone, or with me.
HandfulOfDust	46	35809	35795	35841	Teddy	There were planks and ladders and heaps of plaster about. "Oh, [MASK], what a shame. I do hate seeing things modernized." "It isn't a room we used very much." "No, but still..."
HandfulOfDust	45	35871	35867	35912	Brenda	"You know, [MASK]'s been a wonderful friend to me. I wouldn't say anything against her... but ever since I came here I've been wondering whether she really understands this beautiful place and all it means to you."
HandfulOfDust	53	35924	35880	35933	Tony	I wouldn't say anything against her... but ever since I came here I've been wondering whether she really understands this beautiful place and all it means to you." "Tell me more about your terrible life," said [MASK], leading her back to the central hall.
HandfulOfDust	50	35973	35965	36015	Tony	I've been very unhappy too." [MASK] looked about him desperately in search of help; and help came. "Oh, there you are," said a firm, child's voice. "Come on. We're going down to the woods now.
HandfulOfDust	50	36030	35987	36037	Johnny	"Oh, there you are," said a firm, child's voice. "Come on. We're going down to the woods now. We must hurry, otherwise it will be dark." "Oh, [MASK]-boy, must I really?
HandfulOfDust	51	36072	36038	36089	Tony	I was just talking to daddy." "_Come on._ It's all arranged. And afterwards you're to be allowed to have tea with me upstairs." [MASK] crept into the library, habitable to-day, since the workmen were at rest.
HandfulOfDust	50	36148	36138	36188	Polly	"Oh dear... well there's only me and [MASK] in the smoking-room. Come and have some tea. You look all funny--have you been asleep?" * * * * * "We must write it down a failure, definitely."
HandfulOfDust	47	36306	36284	36331	Veronica	"I shan't be here next week-end," she said, "I'm going to stay with [MASK]." "Am I asked?" "Well, you _were_, of course, but I refused for you.
HandfulOfDust	51	36360	36315	36366	Veronica	"Well, you _were_, of course, but I refused for you. You know you always hate staying away." "I wouldn't mind coming." "Oh, darling, I wish I'd known. [MASK] would have loved it so...
HandfulOfDust	49	36590	36574	36623	Bless	"Is it quite safe?" "Oh, yes, surely?" "[MASK] his heart, I wish I could be here to see him." "Do change your mind." "Oh no, that's quite out of the question.
HandfulOfDust	41	36632	36605	36646	Tony	"Do change your mind." "Oh no, that's quite out of the question. Don't make a thing about it, [MASK]." That was when she first arrived; later everything got better.
HandfulOfDust	50	36819	36784	36834	Tony	he said once. "Yes, of course, darling." "I get depressed down here all alone and imagine things." "You aren't to _brood_, [MASK]. You know that's one of the things that aren't allowed."
HandfulOfDust	48	37209	37180	37228	Brinkwell	"She'd probably love it. I'll ring up and ask her." "Why don't you hunt too? There's a chap called [MASK] who's got some quite decent hirelings, I believe." "Yes, I might."
HandfulOfDust	43	37362	37356	37399	Beaver	"She'll get bored with [MASK] soon enough." "The trouble is that he doesn't care for her in the least. If he did, it would soon be over... What an ass she is being."
HandfulOfDust	45	37505	37475	37520	Lord	"Full of beans." "I was getting worried about him... You don't think he's got any idea about my goings on?" "[MASK] no. It's the last thing that would come into his head."
HandfulOfDust	50	37537	37537	37587	Marjorie	[MASK]'s been frightfully governessy about the whole thing." "Has she? I haven't discussed it with her." "How did _you_ hear?" "My dear girl, until this minute I didn't know you had any goings on.
HandfulOfDust	49	37740	37693	37742	Beaver	"I didn't know you knew." "Oh, I knew all right. But I wasn't going to let her feel important by talking about it." "I couldn't disapprove more of the whole thing. Do you know [MASK]?"
HandfulOfDust	42	38144	38106	38148	Tony	Forty-two minutes," she said, "not at all bad with the wind against me." She was tall and erect, almost austere in helmet and overalls; not at all as [MASK] had imagined her.
HandfulOfDust	49	38213	38202	38251	John	"Are you going to hunt on Wednesday?" asked [MASK]. "They're meeting here, you know." "I might go out for half the day, if I can find a horse. It'll be the first time this year."
HandfulOfDust	51	38406	38369	38420	Tony	"Yes." "The one you said was in love with that young man?" "Yes." "Funny of her... What's this one's name again?" "[MASK] Last. It's a pretty ghastly house, isn't it?"
HandfulOfDust	51	38520	38486	38537	Jock	"I shall stay here until it comes out. It often takes several hours." They showed her where to put the lights out and left her to it. Next day [MASK] said, "Have you got any pigs at the farm?" "Yes."
HandfulOfDust	51	38621	38621	38672	Tony	[MASK] assumed she was asleep until she appeared in overalls from the morning-room. "I was down early," she explained, "and found the men at work stripping the ceiling. I couldn't resist joining in. I hope you don't mind."
HandfulOfDust	49	39505	39493	39542	Tony	He can ride with them as far as the covert," [MASK] had said. "Yes, sir, and there'd be no harm in his stayin' a bit to see hounds working, would there?" "No, I suppose not."
HandfulOfDust	49	39647	39626	39675	John	"I'll see to that, sir. Don't you worry, my beauty," he said to [MASK], "you'll get a hunt right enough." They waited until the end of the line of horses and then trotted soberly behind them.
HandfulOfDust	51	40161	40119	40170	Jock	Presently she shot past them at a gallop; she was flushed in the face and her bun was askew; she leant back, pulling with all her weight. "That girl will come to no good," said [MASK]. They encountered her later at the covert.
HandfulOfDust	48	40261	40256	40304	Thunderclap	"Oh, yes. [MASK]'s terribly fresh. I've never known her like this." There was a long wait as the horn sounded in the heart of the wood. Everyone stood in the corner of the big field, near a gate.
HandfulOfDust	52	40604	40553	40605	Ben	"If you come back in good time to-day your dad will be all the more willing to let you come out another day." "But there mayn't _be_ another day. The world may come to an end. _Please_, [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	55	40859	40805	40860	Ben	I don't feel like hacking him home in his present state. I can't think what's come over him," she added loyally. "He was out on Saturday. I've never known him like this before." "He wants a man up," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	49	41270	41234	41283	John	"The boy's down." She hit him and the horse collected himself and bolted up the road into the village, but before he went one of his heels struck out and sent [MASK] into the ditch, where he lay bent double, perfectly still.
HandfulOfDust	45	41718	41698	41743	Ambrose	"She's probably at that school... But we can't tell her over the telephone... Anyway, [MASK] has tried there and the flat but he can't get through... What on earth are we going to say to her?"
HandfulOfDust	50	41961	41912	41962	Tony	She cut it falling. She was in a terrible state. I sent her back in the car... it wasn't her fault." "No, it wasn't anybody's fault. It just happened." "That's it," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	52	41974	41963	42015	Brenda	"It just happened... how are we going to tell [MASK]?" "One of us will have to go up." "Yes... I think I shall have to stay here. I don't know why really, but there will be things to see to.
HandfulOfDust	48	42035	41988	42036	Jock	"Yes... I think I shall have to stay here. I don't know why really, but there will be things to see to. It's an awful thing to ask anyone to do..." "I'll go," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	52	42103	42058	42110	John	It's purely formal, of course, but it will be ghastly for that Ripon girl. She'll have to give evidence... she was in a terrible state. I hope I was all right to her. They'd just brought [MASK] in and I was rather muddled.
HandfulOfDust	50	42344	42295	42345	Jock	"I'll take him in the aeroplane. It'll be quicker." "Yes, that will be quicker." "I'll go and change now. I won't be ten minutes." "I'll change, too," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	52	42725	42708	42760	Tony	"It would be awful for you." "No, I'll stay." [MASK] said, "I suppose it's ridiculous of me, but I wish you would... I mean, won't it be awful for you? I am all in a muddle.
HandfulOfDust	45	42894	42874	42919	Tony	"Say that I'll write to him," and, when the footman had left the room, [MASK] said, "An atrocious suggestion." "Oh, I don't know. He's very anxious to be helpful."
HandfulOfDust	54	42963	42950	43004	Tony	"I'm afraid this is a very difficult situation," said [MASK]. "After all we scarcely know each other." "You don't have to think about me." "But it must be awful for you." "And you must stop thinking that."
HandfulOfDust	54	43154	43146	43200	Brenda	"But, you see, I know [MASK] so well." [VI] The library windows were open and the clock, striking the hour, high over head among its crockets and finials, was clearly audible in the quiet room. It was some time since they had spoken.
HandfulOfDust	54	43381	43354	43408	John	"It was twenty-eight minutes past twelve when I heard. I looked at my watch... It was ten to one when they brought [MASK] in... just over three hours ago... It's almost incredible, isn't it, everything becoming absolutely different, suddenly like that?"
HandfulOfDust	50	43555	43507	43557	Brenda	It may be as long again as the time since it happened. That would only make it eight o'clock. It's quite likely she won't come in until eight... Think of it, all the time between now and when it happened, before [MASK] hears.
HandfulOfDust	52	43608	43558	43610	John	It's scarcely credible, is it? And then she's got to get down here. There's a train that leaves at nine something. She might get that. I wonder if I ought to have gone up too... I didn't like to leave [MASK]."
HandfulOfDust	54	43801	43773	43827	Brenda	"In a way I shall feel happier when she knows... it feels all wrong as it is at present, having it as a secret that [MASK] doesn't know... I'm not sure how she fits in her day. I suppose her last lecture is over at about five...
HandfulOfDust	53	44053	44049	44102	Marjorie	Suppose she was with [MASK] when the telegram arrived." "You've got to try and stop thinking about things. Can you throw craps?" "No." "That's easy; I'll show you. There'll be some dice in the backgammon board."
HandfulOfDust	50	44227	44203	44253	Brenda	"Don't you ever take a rest from thinking?" "Suppose the evening papers have got hold of it already. [MASK] may see it on a placard, or just pick up a paper casually and there it will be... perhaps with a photograph."
HandfulOfDust	52	44530	44480	44532	Tony	"It's just a child's game. It would be ridiculous with two." "Show me." "Well each of us chooses an animal." "All right, I'm a dog and you're a hen. Now what?" [MASK] explained.
HandfulOfDust	52	44757	44746	44798	Albert	("Sitting there clucking like a 'en," [MASK] reported, "and the little fellow lying dead upstairs.") "We'd better stop." "It wasn't a very good game. And to think it's the only one you know."
HandfulOfDust	50	45065	45040	45090	Brenda	He had decided on the road up that after trying the flat, he would go to his club and ring up various friends of [MASK]'s who might know where she was. He rang again, from habit, and waited a little; then turned to go.
HandfulOfDust	43	45099	45091	45134	Brenda	But at that moment the door next to [MASK]'s opened and a dark lady in a dress of crimson velvet looked out at him; she wore very large earrings of oriental filigree, set with bosses of opaque, valueless stone.
HandfulOfDust	53	45451	45432	45485	Jock	In so small a room the effect was distracting. The Princess sat at the looking-glass, [MASK] behind her on the divan. "What's your name?" she asked over her shoulder. He told her. "Oh yes, I've heard them mention you.
HandfulOfDust	50	45627	45604	45654	Jenny	It's _too_ horrible." "It wasn't anybody's fault." "Oh yes," said [MASK]. "It was. It was _my_ fault. I ought never to have gone there... a terrible curse hangs over me.
HandfulOfDust	50	45941	45909	45959	Tony	she asked, without looking up. "Awful." He drank the whisky quickly and poured out some more. "Bring me one too, will you?" [MASK] said, "I only wanted to see him about arrangements. He tried to be comforting.
HandfulOfDust	50	46094	46055	46105	One	"That's all right. People are always surprised. I don't see them often. They're at school somewhere. I took them to the cinema last summer. They're getting quite big. [MASK]'s going to be good-looking, I think.
HandfulOfDust	50	46634	46609	46659	Brenda	Why on earth didn't you bring him up?" "No, it's something terribly important. He's got to see [MASK] alone." "My dear, how mysterious. Well, she won't be long now. We can't disturb them.
HandfulOfDust	41	46740	46734	46775	Brenda	"Dear me," said [MASK]. "How very exciting. Who _can_ they be?" "One you must avoid; he bodes no good for you, he is steely hearted and rapacious."
HandfulOfDust	44	46889	46864	46908	Brenda	How very extraordinary. It isn't anything awful, is it?" "You'd better go and see him." Suddenly [MASK] became frightened by the strange air of the room and the unfamiliar expression in her friends' faces.
HandfulOfDust	47	46961	46927	46974	John	Tell me quickly, I'm scared. It's nothing awful, is it?" "I'm afraid it is. There's been a very serious accident." "[MASK]?" "Yes." "Dead?" He nodded.
HandfulOfDust	42	47196	47192	47234	Brenda	I've just seen [MASK]. She's coming down by the seven o'clock train." "Is she terribly upset?" "Yes, naturally." "Where is she now?" "She's with me.
HandfulOfDust	50	47239	47209	47259	Polly	"Is she terribly upset?" "Yes, naturally." "Where is she now?" "She's with me. I'm speaking from [MASK]'s." "Shall I talk to her?" "Better not." "All right...
HandfulOfDust	49	47332	47326	47375	Jock	She did not look up while [MASK] telephoned. Then she said, "Yes, I'll go by that train." "We ought to start. I suppose you will have to get some things from the flat." "My bag... upstairs.
HandfulOfDust	50	47403	47389	47439	Jock	She did not speak on her way to her flat. She sat beside [MASK] as he drove, looking straight ahead. When they arrived she unlocked her door and led him in. The room was extremely empty of furniture. She sat down in the only chair.
HandfulOfDust	49	47455	47424	47473	Jock	The room was extremely empty of furniture. She sat down in the only chair. "There's plenty of time really. Tell me exactly what happened." [MASK] told her. "Poor little boy," she said. "Poor little boy."
HandfulOfDust	49	47636	47623	47672	Jock	I don't think it's any good trying to explain." [MASK] said, "Are you sure you've got everything?" "Yes, that's everything," she nodded towards the little case on the bed. She looked quite hopeless. "
HandfulOfDust	50	47699	47672	47722	Jock	"Well, we'd better go to the station." "All right. It's early. But it doesn't matter." [MASK] took her to the train. As it was Wednesday the carriages were full of women returning after their day's shopping.
HandfulOfDust	55	47814	47768	47823	Jock	"Don't you want anything to read?" "Nothing to read." "Or eat?" "Or eat." "Then I'll say good-bye." "Good-bye." Another woman pushed past [MASK] into the carriage, laden with light parcels.
HandfulOfDust	41	48188	48175	48216	Brenda	Everything was done with delicacy and to show respect for their sorrow. [MASK] said, "Wait a minute. I must just speak to that poor Ripon girl." She did it charmingly. When everyone had gone.
HandfulOfDust	50	48217	48196	48246	Tony	I must just speak to that poor Ripon girl." She did it charmingly. When everyone had gone. [MASK] said, "I wish you had been here yesterday. There were so many people about and I didn't know what to say to them."
HandfulOfDust	54	48309	48256	48310	Brenda	"There was the Shameless Blonde... we played animal snap some of the time." "Animal snap? Was that any good?" "Not much... It's odd to think that yesterday this time it hadn't happened." "Poor little boy," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	59	48430	48388	48447	Ben	A day of fitful sunshine and blustering wind; white and grey clouds were scarcely moving, high overhead, but the bare trees round the house swayed and shook and there were swift whirlpools of straw in the stable yard. [MASK] changed from the Sunday suit he had worn at the inquest and went about his duties.
HandfulOfDust	47	48466	48466	48513	Brenda	[MASK] took off her hat and threw it down on a chair in the hall. "Nothing to say, is there?" "There's no need to talk." "No. I suppose there'll have to be a funeral."
HandfulOfDust	51	48551	48514	48565	Brenda	"Well, of course." "Yes: to-morrow?" She looked into the morning-room. "They've done quite a lot, haven't they?" All [MASK]'s movements were slower than usual and her voice was flat and expressionless.
HandfulOfDust	49	48592	48566	48615	Tony	She sank down into one of the armchairs in the centre of the hall, which nobody ever used. She sat there doing nothing. [MASK] put his hand on her shoulder but she said "Don't", not impatiently or nervously but without any expression.
HandfulOfDust	47	48765	48752	48799	John	"If you please, my lady, I've been going through [MASK]'s things. There's this handkerchief doesn't belong to him." The heavy scent and crowned cipher at the corner proclaimed its origin. "I know whose it is.
HandfulOfDust	52	48835	48800	48852	Brenda	I'll send it back to her." "Can't think how it came to be there," said nanny. "Poor little boy. Poor little boy," said [MASK] to herself, when nanny had left her, and gazed out across the troubled landscape.
HandfulOfDust	46	48873	48853	48899	Ben	* * * * * "I was thinking about the pony, sir." "Oh yes, [MASK]?" "Will you want to be keeping her now?" "I hadn't thought... no, I suppose not."
HandfulOfDust	54	48986	48957	49011	Ben	and she's always been treated well. I don't think she ought to go under twenty-five quid, sir." "All right, [MASK], you see about it." "I'll ask thirty, shall I, sir, and come down a bit?"
HandfulOfDust	54	49094	49043	49097	Veronica	He wanted to know if there was anything he could do." "How sweet of him. Why don't you have him down for the week-end?" "Would you like that?" "I shan't be here. I'm going to [MASK]'s."
HandfulOfDust	50	49103	49098	49148	Veronica	"You're going to [MASK]'s?" "Yes, don't you remember?" There were servants in the room so that they said nothing more until later, when they were alone in the library. Then, "Are you really going away?"
HandfulOfDust	48	49186	49149	49197	Brenda	"Yes. I can't stay here. You understand that, don't you?" "Yes, of course. I was thinking we might both go away, abroad somewhere." [MASK] did not answer him but continued in her own line.
HandfulOfDust	46	49222	49198	49244	Darling	"I couldn't stay here. It's all over, don't you see, our life down here." "[MASK], what _do_ you mean?" "Don't ask me to explain... not just now."
HandfulOfDust	48	49329	49319	49367	Jock	"Mmmm." "I think I will ask [MASK] to come." "Yes, I should." "And we can think about plans later when we've got more used to things." "Yes, later." Next morning.
HandfulOfDust	48	49377	49334	49382	Brenda	"Yes, I should." "And we can think about plans later when we've got more used to things." "Yes, later." Next morning. "A sweet letter from mother," said [MASK], handing it across.
HandfulOfDust	45	49396	49389	49434	Hetton	...I shall not come down to [MASK] for the funeral, but I shall be thinking of you both all the time and of my dear grandson. I shall think of you as I saw you all three, together, at Christmas.
HandfulOfDust	49	49689	49644	49693	Jock	I can't tell you what she was like here... quite mechanical. It's so much worse for her than it is for me, I see that. It's so terrible not being able to do anything to help." [MASK] did not answer.
HandfulOfDust	51	49922	49872	49923	Brenda	Please do not mind too much. I suppose we shan't be allowed to meet while the case is on but I hope afterwards we shall be great friends. Anyway, I shall always look on you as one whatever you think of me. Best love from [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	51	49961	49954	50005	Jock	But later he showed the letter to [MASK], who said, "I'm sorry it should have happened like this." "But it's not true, is it?" "Yes, I'm afraid it is. Everyone has known for some time."
HandfulOfDust	45	50065	50031	50076	Brenda	CHAPTER IV ENGLISH GOTHIC--II [I] "How's the old boy taking it?" "Not so well. It makes me feel rather a beast," said [MASK]. "I'm afraid he minds a lot."
HandfulOfDust	51	50563	50563	50614	Brenda	[MASK] must have felt a tiny bit neglected--people often do at that stage of marriage. I have known countless cases--and it was naturally flattering to find a young man to beg and carry for her. That's all it was, nothing _wrong_.
HandfulOfDust	51	50997	50966	51017	Tony	"Oh, I see. I didn't think it was likely... I just rang you up." "That's all right. How are you, [MASK]?" "All right, thanks." "Good, so am I. Good-bye."
HandfulOfDust	48	51049	51007	51055	Brenda	"Good, so am I. Good-bye." That was all he had heard of her. Both avoided places where there was a likelihood of their meeting. * * * * * It was thought convenient that [MASK] should appear as the plaintiff.
HandfulOfDust	43	51056	51056	51099	Tony	[MASK] did not employ the family solicitors in the matter but another less reputable firm who specialized in divorce. He had steeled himself to expect a certain professional gusto, even levity, but found them instead disposed to melancholy and suspicion.
HandfulOfDust	48	51170	51123	51171	Tony	Moreover, there is the question of money. You understand that by the present arrangement since she is the innocent and injured party she will be entitled to claim substantial alimony from the courts?" "Oh, that's all right," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	59	51523	51497	51556	Jock	"I have no doubt of it," said the solicitor, bowing politely. But when he came to discuss the question later with [MASK], it did not seem so easy. "It's not a thing one can ask every girl to do," he said, "whichever way you put it.
HandfulOfDust	48	51622	51620	51668	Sybil	But even [MASK] refused. "I'd do it like a shot any other time," she said, "but just at the moment it wouldn't suit my book. There's a certain person who might hear about it and take it wrong...
HandfulOfDust	48	51916	51869	51917	Jock	Two or three girls were clustered round the Jack-Pot machine, losing shillings hard and complaining about the cold. They ordered a bottle of the Montmorency Wine Company's brand and sat down to wait. "Any of those do?" asked [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	47	51964	51954	52001	Milly	"How are the postmen's hats?" said [MASK]. They could not recognize the allusion. "You are the two boys who were here last month, aren't you?" "Yes. I'm afraid we were rather tight."
HandfulOfDust	44	52053	52028	52072	Babs	"Well, come and sit down. How are you both?" "I think I'm starting a cold," said [MASK]. "I feel awful. Why can't they heat this hole, the mean hounds?"
HandfulOfDust	41	52143	52125	52166	Babs	"What, this weather? That'll be a nice treat for a lonely girl." [MASK] sniffed into a little ball of a handkerchief. "It's for a divorce." "Oh, I see.
HandfulOfDust	56	52174	52167	52223	Milly	Well, why doesn't he take [MASK]? She doesn't catch cold easy. Besides, she knows how to behave at an hotel. Lots of the girls here are all right to have a lark with in town, but you have to have a _lady_ for a divorce."
HandfulOfDust	51	52270	52224	52275	Tony	"D'you often get asked to do that?" "Now and then. It's a nice rest--but it means so much _talking_ and the gentlemen will always go on so about their wives." While they were dancing [MASK] came straight to business.
HandfulOfDust	49	52400	52352	52401	Winnie	"Yes." "You mean you wouldn't mind?" "I mean I should mind." "Oh... You wouldn't think I had a little girl of eight, would you?" "No." "She's called [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	47	52473	52468	52515	Tony	"No," said [MASK]. "I'm sorry but it would be quite impossible. We'll get a lovely present for you to take back to her." "All right... One gentleman gave her a fairy-cycle for Christmas.
HandfulOfDust	53	52746	52706	52759	Tony	All this kept him awake. [II] There was a general rendezvous at the first-class booking office. The detectives were there earliest, ten minutes before their time. They had been pointed out to [MASK] at the solicitor's office so that he should not lose them.
HandfulOfDust	47	52926	52880	52927	Tony	They bought the tickets and waited. The detectives, sticklers for professional etiquette, made an attempt at self-effacement, studying the posters on the walls and peering from behind a pillar. "This is going to be hell," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	52	52960	52936	52988	Milly	She emerged from the gloom with a porter in front carrying her suitcase and a child dragging back on her arm behind her. [MASK]'s wardrobe consisted mainly of evening dresses, for during the day she usually spent her time sitting before a gas fire in her dressing-gown.
HandfulOfDust	50	53010	52989	53039	Winnie	She made an insignificant and rather respectable appearance. "Sorry if I'm late," she said. "[MASK] here couldn't find her shoes. I brought her along too. I knew you wouldn't mind really. She travels on a half ticket."
HandfulOfDust	47	53040	53018	53065	Winnie	I brought her along too. I knew you wouldn't mind really. She travels on a half ticket." [MASK] was a plain child with large gold-rimmed spectacles. When she spoke she revealed that two of her front teeth were missing.
HandfulOfDust	53	53089	53052	53105	Milly	When she spoke she revealed that two of her front teeth were missing. "I hope you don't imagine she's coming with us." "Yes, that the idea," said [MASK]. "She won't be any trouble--she's got her puzzle."
HandfulOfDust	52	53106	53091	53143	Tony	"She won't be any trouble--she's got her puzzle." [MASK] bent down to speak to the little girl. "Listen," he said. "You don't want to come to a nasty big hotel. You go with this kind gentleman here.
HandfulOfDust	52	53190	53175	53227	Winnie	You'll like that, won't you?" "No," said [MASK]. "I want to go to the seaside. I won't go with that man. I don't want a doll. I want to go to the seaside with my mummy."
HandfulOfDust	50	53250	53201	53251	Tony	I won't go with that man. I don't want a doll. I want to go to the seaside with my mummy." Several people besides the detectives were beginning to take notice of the oddly assorted group. "Oh God!" said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	53	53286	53281	53334	Milly	"Look," said [MASK], "we're travelling first-class. Isn't that fun? We can have tea." "Can I have an ice?" "I don't expect they've got an ice. But you can have some nice tea."
HandfulOfDust	46	53445	53403	53449	Tony	She was not inventive but she knew the classic routine thoroughly, even to such commonplace but alarming devices as breathing heavily, grunting and complaining of nausea. * * * * * Rooms at the hotel had been engaged for [MASK] by the solicitors.
HandfulOfDust	46	53460	53450	53496	Winnie	It was therefore a surprise to the reception clerk when [MASK] arrived. "We have reserved in your name double and single communicating rooms, bathroom and sitting-room," he said. "We did not understand you were bringing your daughter.
HandfulOfDust	50	53748	53708	53758	Tony	"But it's dark now, pet. You shall see it to-morrow." "I want to see it to-night." "You take her to see it now," said [MASK]. "Sure you won't be lonely?"
HandfulOfDust	50	53786	53759	53809	Tony	"Quite sure." "We won't be long." "That's all right. You let her see it properly." [MASK] went down to the bar where he was pleased to find the two detectives. He felt the need of male company.
HandfulOfDust	50	53867	53860	53910	Tony	"Have a drink." Since [MASK] was paying their expenses in any case, the offer seemed superfluous, but the junior detective brightened instinctively and said, "Don't mind if I do." "Come and sit down. I feel rather lonely."
HandfulOfDust	46	54057	54044	54090	Tony	Gets me in the joints." "Tell me," said [MASK]. "Is it usual to bring children on an expedition of this kind?" "It is _not_." "I thought it couldn't be."
HandfulOfDust	52	54132	54109	54161	James	It looks wrong, and cases of this kind depend very much on making the right impression. Of course as far as [MASK] and me are concerned, the matter is O.K. There won't be a word about it in our evidence. But you can't trust the servants.
HandfulOfDust	54	54253	54239	54293	Tony	"How about one with us?" "Tell me," said [MASK], when they had been at their table some little time. "You must have observed numerous couples in your time, qualifying for a divorce; tell me, how do they get through their day?"
HandfulOfDust	49	54304	54294	54343	Blenkinsop	"It's easier in the summer," said [MASK], "the young ladies usually bathe and the gentlemen read the papers on the esplanade; some goes for motor drives and some just hangs around the bar. They're mostly glad when Monday comes."
HandfulOfDust	44	54373	54364	54408	Milly	"I've ordered an ice," said [MASK]. "Quite right." "I want late dinner. I want late dinner." "No, dear, not late dinner. You have an ice up here."
HandfulOfDust	50	54526	54488	54538	Blenkinsop	"You would not find me ungrateful." "Well, sir, I don't want to appear unobliging, but it's not part of my duties." He seemed to be wavering but [MASK] interposed. "Quite out of the question, sir."
HandfulOfDust	46	54619	54578	54624	Winnie	"Our trouble is always the same--to make the clients realize that divorce is a serious matter." Eventually extravagant promises for the morrow, two or three ices, and the slight depression induced by them persuaded [MASK] to go to bed.
HandfulOfDust	51	54659	54637	54688	Winnie	"Oh, just as you like." "Just as _you_ like." "Well, perhaps [MASK] would be happier with you... she'll have to go into the other room to-morrow morning when they bring in breakfast, of course."
HandfulOfDust	48	54703	54666	54714	Tony	she'll have to go into the other room to-morrow morning when they bring in breakfast, of course." So she was tucked up in a corner of the double bed and to [MASK]'s surprise was asleep before they went down to dinner.
HandfulOfDust	55	54967	54964	55019	Milly	He smiled at [MASK] from the doorway. "Charming," he said, "perfectly charming. Shall we go down to dinner?" Their rooms were on the first floor. Step by step, with her hand on his arm, they descended the staircase into the bright hall below.
HandfulOfDust	50	55026	54991	55041	Milly	Their rooms were on the first floor. Step by step, with her hand on his arm, they descended the staircase into the bright hall below. "Cheer up," said [MASK]. "You have a tongue sandwich. That'll make you talk."
HandfulOfDust	53	55085	55052	55105	More	"I was only joking. You are a serious boy, aren't you?" In spite of the savage weather the hotel seemed full of week-end visitors. [MASK] were arriving through the swing doors, their eyes moist and their cheeks rigid from the icy cold outside.
HandfulOfDust	53	55142	55133	55186	Milly	One of the new arrivals was a friend of [MASK]'s. He was supervising the collection of his luggage. Anywhere else he would have been a noticeable figure, for he wore a large fur coat and a beret; under the coat appeared tartan stockings and black and white shoes.
HandfulOfDust	47	55533	55526	55573	Dan	We get all sorts there, but [MASK]'s one of the decent ones. I was going to have gone abroad with him once but in the end he couldn't get away." "His girl didn't seem to like us much."
HandfulOfDust	49	55582	55541	55590	Tony	I was going to have gone abroad with him once but in the end he couldn't get away." "His girl didn't seem to like us much." "Oh, she was cold." [MASK] did not find conversation easy at dinner.
HandfulOfDust	49	55640	55625	55674	Milly	"I wonder you don't go and join her, dear," said [MASK] testily. "Look at that woman's diamonds. Do you think they can be real?" "Why don't you ask her, if you're so interested?"
HandfulOfDust	55	55820	55775	55830	Dan	All the time, at the back of his mind, he was worrying with the problem of what they could possibly do after dinner, but it was solved for him, just as he was lighting his cigar, by the appearance of [MASK] from the other side of the dining-room.
HandfulOfDust	57	55959	55959	56016	Dan	[MASK]'s friend was most hospitable. When he was not fiddling with the wireless, which gave trouble off and on throughout the evening, he was sauntering among his guests refilling their glasses. "This stuff's all right," he said, showing the label, "it won't hurt you.
HandfulOfDust	45	56068	56063	56108	Dan	"I'm so glad [MASK] brought you," he would say. "Hope you're getting all you want. Delighted to see you. Come again when there isn't a crowd and see over the place. Interested in roses?
HandfulOfDust	48	56304	56290	56338	Milly	Of course that put the kybosh on it, but I've always liked [MASK] just the same. You can trust her to behave anywhere." He said this with a sour glance towards Baby, who was full of the right stuff and showing it.
HandfulOfDust	54	56349	56309	56363	Dan	You can trust her to behave anywhere." He said this with a sour glance towards Baby, who was full of the right stuff and showing it. It was after three before the party broke up. [MASK]'s friend renewed his invitation to come again when the roses were out.
HandfulOfDust	53	56395	56395	56448	Baby	[MASK] sat beside him in front, disposed to be quarrelsome. "Where were you?" she kept asking. "Never saw you all the evening. Where did you get to? Where were you hiding? I call it a lousy way to take a girl out."
HandfulOfDust	47	56551	56541	56588	Tony	"Mother's still asleep," she said. [MASK] looked at his watch. "So I should think," he said. It was a quarter-past seven. "Go back to bed." "No, I'm dressed.
HandfulOfDust	51	56671	56636	56687	Tony	"I want to go on the pier." "It won't be open yet." "Well, I want to go down to the sea. Come on." [MASK] knew that he would not get to sleep again that morning. "All right.
HandfulOfDust	48	56800	56753	56801	Winnie	Two or three female figures were scudding along, bowed to the wind, prayer-books clutched in their gloved hands. Four or five rugged old men were hobbling down to bathe, hissing like ostlers. "Oh, come on," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	42	56821	56802	56844	Winnie	They went down to the beach and stumbled painfully across the shingle to the margin of the sea. [MASK] threw some stones. The bathers were in the water now; some of them had dogs who swam snorting beside them.
HandfulOfDust	49	56854	56845	56894	Winnie	"Why don't you bathe?" asked [MASK]. "Far too cold." "But _they're_ bathing. I want to." "You must ask your mother." "I believe you're afraid. Can you swim?"
HandfulOfDust	50	56931	56883	56933	Fibber	"I believe you're afraid. Can you swim?" "Yes." "Well, why don't you? Bet you can't." "All right. I can't." "Then why did you say you could. [MASK]."
HandfulOfDust	44	56940	56934	56978	Winnie	They walked along the shingle. [MASK] slithered about astride a backwater. "Now my knickers are wet," she said. "Better come back and change." "It feels horrible. Let's go and have breakfast."
HandfulOfDust	52	57020	56971	57023	Winnie	Let's go and have breakfast." The hotel did not, as a rule, cater for guests who breakfasted downstairs at eight o'clock on Sunday morning. It took a long time before anything could be got ready. There were no ices, much to [MASK]'s annoyance.
HandfulOfDust	52	57076	57065	57117	Blenkinsop	Here at nine o'clock he was interrupted by the arrival of [MASK]. "We missed you last night," he said. "We went to a party." "You shouldn't have done that--not strictly, but I daresay no harm will come of it.
HandfulOfDust	47	57134	57089	57136	Winnie	"We went to a party." "You shouldn't have done that--not strictly, but I daresay no harm will come of it. Have you had your breakfast?" "Yes, in the dining-room with [MASK]."
HandfulOfDust	54	57222	57198	57252	Tony	You'll never get your divorce if you don't give your mind to it more." "All right," said [MASK]. "I'll have breakfast again." "In bed, mind." "In bed." And he went wearily upstairs to his rooms.
HandfulOfDust	50	57253	57224	57274	Winnie	"I'll have breakfast again." "In bed, mind." "In bed." And he went wearily upstairs to his rooms. [MASK] had drawn the curtains but her mother was still asleep. "She woke up once and then turned over.
HandfulOfDust	42	57300	57299	57341	Milly	"[MASK]." "Oh," she said. "What time is it?" "We've got to have breakfast." "Don't want any breakfast. I think I'll sleep a little."
HandfulOfDust	48	57350	57303	57351	Winnie	"Oh," she said. "What time is it?" "We've got to have breakfast." "Don't want any breakfast. I think I'll sleep a little." "You've had breakfast," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	47	57390	57382	57429	Winnie	"O.K.," she said. "[MASK], darling, give mother her jacket off the chair." She was a conscientious girl, ready to go through with her job, however unattractive it might seem. "But it's early."
HandfulOfDust	54	57430	57402	57456	Tony	" She was a conscientious girl, ready to go through with her job, however unattractive it might seem. "But it's early." [MASK] went into his room and took off his shoes, collar and tie, coat and waistcoat, and put on a dressing-gown.
HandfulOfDust	52	57464	57457	57509	Winnie	"You are greedy," said [MASK], "eating two breakfasts." "When you're a little older you'll understand these things. It's the Law. Now I want you to stay in the sitting-room for a quarter of an hour very quietly.
HandfulOfDust	48	57596	57589	57637	Tony	When the tray had been brought, [MASK] got out of bed and put on his things. "So much for my infidelity," he said. "It is curious to reflect that this will be described in the papers as "intimacy"."
HandfulOfDust	47	57649	57608	57655	Milly	So much for my infidelity," he said. "It is curious to reflect that this will be described in the papers as "intimacy"." "Can I bathe now?" "Certainly." [MASK] turned over to sleep again.
HandfulOfDust	52	57689	57663	57715	Tony	The wind had got up and a heavy sea was pounding on the shingle. "This little girl would like to bathe," said [MASK]. "No bathing for children to-day," said the beach attendant. "The very idea," said various onlookers.
HandfulOfDust	51	57756	57706	57757	Winnie	"The very idea," said various onlookers. "Does he want to drown the child?" "He's no business to be trusted with children." "_Unnatural beast._" "But I _want_ to bathe," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	47	57779	57758	57805	Tony	"You said I could bathe if you had two breakfasts." The people who had clustered round to witness [MASK]'s discomfort, looked at one another askance. "Two breakfasts? Wanting to let the child bathe? The man's balmy."
HandfulOfDust	51	57812	57793	57844	Tony	Wanting to let the child bathe? The man's balmy." "Never mind," said [MASK]. "We'll go on the pier." Several of the crowd followed them round the slots, curious to see what new enormity this mad father might attempt.
HandfulOfDust	57	57875	57823	57880	Winnie	Several of the crowd followed them round the slots, curious to see what new enormity this mad father might attempt. "There's a man who's eaten two breakfasts and tries to drown his little girl," they informed other spectators, sceptically observing his attempts to amuse [MASK] with skee-ball.
HandfulOfDust	51	58167	58118	58169	Brenda	Judges in their more lucid moments sometimes wonder why perfectly respectable, happily married men go off for week-ends to the seaside with women they do not know. It is always helpful to offer evidence of general degeneracy." "I see," said [MASK]. "
HandfulOfDust	52	58734	58734	58786	Tony	[MASK] agreed. "My mother is extremely upset about it, naturally. I'm upset myself. I don't mind admitting, perfectly frankly, that I think she has behaved very foolishly, foolishly and wrongly. I can quite understand your being upset about it too."
HandfulOfDust	46	58792	58748	58794	Tony	I'm upset myself. I don't mind admitting, perfectly frankly, that I think she has behaved very foolishly, foolishly and wrongly. I can quite understand your being upset about it too." "Yes," said [MASK]. "
HandfulOfDust	49	58827	58794	58843	Brenda	"But all the same, making every allowance for your feelings, I do think that you are behaving rather vindictively in the matter." "I'm doing exactly what [MASK] wanted." "My dear fellow, she doesn't know what she wants.
HandfulOfDust	53	58848	58831	58884	Beaver	"My dear fellow, she doesn't know what she wants. I saw this chap [MASK] yesterday. I didn't like him _at all_. Do you?" "I hardly know him." "Well, I can assure you I didn't like him.
HandfulOfDust	51	58890	58861	58912	Brenda	Do you?" "I hardly know him." "Well, I can assure you I didn't like him. Now you're just throwing [MASK] into his arms. That's what it amounts to, as I see it, and I call it vindictive.
HandfulOfDust	42	58919	58895	58937	Brenda	That's what it amounts to, as I see it, and I call it vindictive. Of course, at the moment [MASK]'s got the idea that she's in love with him. But it won't last.
HandfulOfDust	46	58971	58967	59013	Allan	"I've told [MASK]. I don't want her back." "Well, that's vindictive." "No, I just couldn't feel the same about her again." "Well, why feel _the same_?
HandfulOfDust	50	59360	59314	59364	Brenda	I mean to say, it takes two to make a quarrel and I gather things had been going wrong for some time. For instance, you'd been drinking a lot--have some more burgundy, by the way." "Did [MASK] say that?"
HandfulOfDust	48	59442	59401	59449	Brenda	Well, that's a bit thick, you know. I'm all for people going their own way, but if they do they can't blame others, if you see what I mean." "Did [MASK] say that?" "Yes.
HandfulOfDust	52	59477	59450	59502	Brenda	Don't think I'm trying to lecture you or anything, but all I feel is that you haven't any right to be vindictive to [MASK], as things are." "She said I drank and was having an affair with the woman with a Moorish name?"
HandfulOfDust	42	59540	59503	59545	Tony	"Well, I don't know she actually said that, but she said you'd been getting tight lately and that you were certainly interested in that girl." The fat young man opposite [MASK] ordered prunes and cream.
HandfulOfDust	49	59595	59585	59634	Brenda	"It's about money. I understand that when [MASK] was in a very agitated state just after the death of her child, she consented to some verbal arrangement with you about settlements." "Yes, I'm allowing her five hundred a year."
HandfulOfDust	48	59779	59751	59799	Brenda	"That's quite out of the question. I couldn't begin to afford it." "Well, you know, I have to consider [MASK]'s interests. She has very little of her own and there will be no more coming to her.
HandfulOfDust	53	59871	59862	59915	Reggie	So you see--" "But, my dear [MASK], you know as well as I do that it's out of the question." "It's rather less than a third of your income." "Yes, but almost every penny goes straight back to the estate.
HandfulOfDust	49	59920	59902	59951	Brenda	"Yes, but almost every penny goes straight back to the estate. Do you realize that [MASK] and I together haven't spent half that amount a year on our personal expenses? It's all I can do to keep things going as it is."
HandfulOfDust	47	59963	59952	59999	Tony	"I didn't expect you'd take this line, [MASK]. I think it's extremely unreasonable of you. After all, it's absurd to pretend in these days that a single man can't be perfectly comfortable on four thousand a year.
HandfulOfDust	51	60286	60262	60313	Brenda	"I can't understand why you are taking up this attitude." "What is more, I don't believe that [MASK] ever expected or wanted me to agree." "Oh yes, she did, my dear fellow. I assure you of that."
HandfulOfDust	48	60325	60307	60355	Reggie	I assure you of that." "It's inconceivable." "Well," said [MASK], puffing at his cigar, "there's more to it than just money. Perhaps I'd better tell you everything. I hadn't meant to.
HandfulOfDust	47	60448	60435	60482	Reggie	"It's not how I should have put it," said [MASK]. "Well, I'm not going to and that's the end of it. If that's all you wanted to say, I may as well leave you."
HandfulOfDust	51	60561	60553	60604	Brenda	but I see it's not possible. [MASK] will ask for alimony of two thousand a year from the Court and on our evidence we shall get it. I'm sorry you oblige me to put it so bluntly." "I hadn't thought of that."
HandfulOfDust	53	60619	60596	60649	Beaver	"I hadn't thought of that." "No, nor had we, to be quite frank. It was [MASK]'s idea." "You seem to have got me in a fairly hopeless position." "It's not how I should have put it."
HandfulOfDust	49	60659	60624	60673	Brenda	"You seem to have got me in a fairly hopeless position." "It's not how I should have put it." "I should like to make absolutely sure that [MASK] is in on this. D'you mind if I ring her up?"
HandfulOfDust	51	60747	60718	60769	Tony	"Yes, he said something about it." "He tells me that you are going to sue for alimony. Is that so?" "[MASK], don't be so bullying. The lawyers are doing everything. It's no use coming to me."
HandfulOfDust	50	60821	60785	60835	Hetton	"Yes. They did say that. I know it sounds a lot but..." "And you know exactly how my money stands, don't you? You know it means selling [MASK], don't you?... hullo, are you still there?"
HandfulOfDust	49	60853	60852	60901	Tony	"[MASK], don't make me feel a beast. Everything has been so difficult." "You do know just what you are asking?" "Yes... I suppose so." "All right, that's all I wanted to know."
HandfulOfDust	52	60903	60863	60915	Tony	Everything has been so difficult." "You do know just what you are asking?" "Yes... I suppose so." "All right, that's all I wanted to know." "[MASK], how odd you sound... don't ring off."
HandfulOfDust	53	60980	60944	60997	Reggie	A whole Gothic world had come to grief... there was now no armour glittering through the forest glades, no embroidered feet on the green sward; the cream and dappled unicorns had fled... [MASK] sat expanded in his chair. "Well?" "I got on to her.
HandfulOfDust	53	61048	61003	61056	Brenda	I'm sorry I didn't believe you. It seemed so unlikely at first." "That's all right, my dear fellow." "I've decided exactly what's going to happen." "Good." "[MASK] is not going to get her divorce.
HandfulOfDust	51	61145	61132	61183	Brenda	When I come back, if she wishes it, I shall divorce [MASK] without settlements of any kind. Is that clear?" "But look here, my dear fellow." "Good night. Thank you for the dinner. Good luck to the excavations."
HandfulOfDust	48	61382	61335	61383	Tony	"I expect your ass of a brother put the thing wrong." CHAPTER V IN SEARCH OF A CITY [I] "any idea how many times round the deck make a mile?" "None, I'm afraid," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	45	61678	61642	61687	Tony	Presently the man had taken to nodding, then to saying "Hullo" or "Bit choppy" or "Here we are again"; finally he had stopped and began a conversation. [MASK] went aft to break this rather embarrassing sequence.
HandfulOfDust	47	61952	61930	61977	Tony	Then he left his greatcoat in the cabin and went down to dinner. It was the first evening at sea. [MASK] sat at the captain's table, but the captain was on the bridge. There were empty chairs on either side of him.
HandfulOfDust	50	62085	62052	62102	Tony	"I see you are not a sufferer. My wife is in her cabin. _She_ is a sufferer." He was returning from a Congress, he told [MASK]. At the top of the stairs was a lounge named the Music and Writing Room.
HandfulOfDust	57	62200	62160	62217	Tony	Here too the steward for an hour every day presided over the cupboardful of novels which constituted the ship's library. "It's not much of a boat," said the genial passenger, sitting himself beside [MASK]. "But I expect things will look brighter when we get into the sun."
HandfulOfDust	56	62218	62202	62258	Tony	"But I expect things will look brighter when we get into the sun." [MASK] lit a cigar and was told by a steward that he must not smoke in this room. "That's all right," said the genial passenger, "we're just going down to the bar.
HandfulOfDust	51	62373	62323	62374	Tony	Always get the cheeriest crowd at the purser's table _and_ the best attention--the purser told me about you. You're the explorer, aren't you?" "Yes, come to think of it, I suppose I am," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	44	62676	62676	62720	Tony	[MASK] had bicycled along straight, white roads to visit the chateaux; he carried rolls of bread and cold veal tied to the back of the machine, and the soft dust seeped into them through the paper and gritted against his teeth.
HandfulOfDust	51	63054	63053	63104	Tony	Thus [MASK] had no very ambitious ideas about travel, and when he decided to go abroad his first act was to call at a tourist agency and come away laden with a sheaf of brightly coloured prospectuses, which advertised commodious cruises among palm trees, Negresses and ruined arches.
HandfulOfDust	48	64642	64605	64653	Tony	The crests of the waves caught the reflection from the promenade deck and shone for a moment before plunging away into the black depths behind. The beagles were awake, whining. For some days now [MASK] had been thoughtless about the events of the immediate past.
HandfulOfDust	52	64939	64915	64967	Tony	The masts swung slowly across this sky and the bows heaved and wallowed below the horizon. The man who had made friends with [MASK] paraded the deck with the two beagles. They strained at the end of their chains, sniffing the scuppers; the man lurched behind them unsteadily.
HandfulOfDust	52	64987	64968	65020	Tony	He wore a pair of race glasses with which he occasionally surveyed the seas; he offered them to [MASK] whenever they passed each other. "Been talking to the wireless operator," he said. "We ought to pass quite near the Yarmouth Castle at about eleven."
HandfulOfDust	50	65293	65253	65303	Ernie	High noon and an even keel; the blue water lapping against the sides of the ship, rippling away behind her to the horizon; gramophones and deck tennis; bright arcs of flying fish ("Look, [MASK], come quick, there's a shark."
HandfulOfDust	53	65841	65794	65847	Catholic	But she was an ugly girl, always eating chocolates..." "...Now I am coming home to be married... No, I am not yet engaged, but you see there are so few young men I can marry. They must be [MASK] and of an island family.
HandfulOfDust	49	67004	66971	67020	Th?r?se	They dined at an hotel high up out of town and ate flying fish. "You must come to my home and see what real creole cooking is like," said [MASK]. "We have a lot of old recipes that the planters used to use.
HandfulOfDust	48	67133	67109	67157	Honor	"And you will have to choose your husband." "Yes. There are seven of them. There was one called [MASK]? I liked, but of course I haven't seen him for two years. He was studying to be an engineer.
HandfulOfDust	50	67282	67270	67320	Tony	"I expect you'll be married by then." "[MASK], why haven't you ever got married?" "But I am." "Married?" "Yes." "You're teasing me." "No, honestly I am.
HandfulOfDust	52	67474	67442	67494	Th?r?se	Then they sat in a rowing-boat and bobbed slowly out to the ship. Earlier in the day, in good spirits, they had bought a stuffed fish. [MASK] found she had left it behind at the hotel. "It doesn't matter," she said.
HandfulOfDust	41	67628	67614	67655	Tony	"He was someone on the ship," she explained, obviously. [MASK] saw her once next day in the town, driving with a lady who was obviously her mother. She waved but did not stop. "
HandfulOfDust	46	67674	67648	67694	Tony	She waved but did not stop. "Reserved lot, these real old creoles," remarked the passenger who had first made friends with [MASK] and had now attached himself again. "Poor as church mice most of them, but stinking proud.
HandfulOfDust	50	67735	67719	67769	Tony	Do they ever so much as ask you to their houses? Not they." [MASK] spent the two days with his first friend who had business connections in the place. On the second day it rained heavily and they could not leave the terrace of the hotel.
HandfulOfDust	57	68525	68491	68548	Tony	They ate in the boat, out of tins, and drank rum mixed with the water of the river, which was mahogany brown but quite clear. The nights seemed interminable to [MASK]; twelve hours of darkness, noisier than a city square with the squealing and croaking and trumpeting of the bush denizens.
HandfulOfDust	55	68611	68561	68616	Tony	It was not possible to read by the light of the storm lantern. Sleep was irregular and brief after the days of lassitude and torpor. There was little to talk about; everything had been said during the day, in the warm shade among the stores. [MASK] lay awake, scratching.
HandfulOfDust	48	68621	68617	68665	Georgetown	Since they had left [MASK] there had not been any part of his body that was ever wholly at ease. His face and neck were burned by the sun reflected from the water; the skin was flaking off them so that he was unable to shave.
HandfulOfDust	52	69583	69532	69584	Jock	Come to think of it," she added later, "I suppose that this is the last year _I_ shall be able to go to this kind of party." "You're going through with the divorce?" "I don't know, [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	49	69642	69610	69659	Tony	I have to feed him a bit of high-life every week or so, and I suppose that'll all stop if there's a divorce. Any news of [MASK]?" "Not for some time now. I got a cable when he landed.
HandfulOfDust	48	69759	69725	69773	Tony	I shouldn't like to think of him being unhappy." "I expect he's getting used to things." "I do hope so. I'm very fond of [MASK], you know, in spite of the monstrous way he behaved."
HandfulOfDust	50	70823	70789	70839	Macushi	"We'd better go back to camp and wait. The men have been away three days. It's not likely they will be much longer... I wish I could speak [MASK]." They turned about, the four of them, and left the village.
HandfulOfDust	41	70872	70867	70908	Jock	For a long time now [MASK] had had a question which his constituents wanted him to ask. It came up that afternoon. "Number twenty," he said. A few members turned to the order paper. _
HandfulOfDust	53	71137	71108	71161	Jock	"Would the honourable member consider an increase of the specified maximum of fatness on the shoulders?" "I must have notice of that question." [MASK] left the House that afternoon with the comfortable feeling that he had at last done something tangible in the interest of his constituents.
HandfulOfDust	53	71193	71193	71246	Tony	[MASK] went into the bush with his gun, but the game had all migrated from that part of the river bank. One of the black boys was badly injured in the foot and calf by a sting-ray; after that they stopped bathing and washed in a zinc pail.
HandfulOfDust	50	71602	71553	71603	Rosa	"You say I want ten men. I give them guns." "You give me cigarettes..." Negotiations lasted for two days. Eventually twelve men agreed to come; seven of them insisted on bringing their wives with them. One of these was [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	44	72064	72028	72072	John	but I don't know. _As things are_, I'm not sure it would be wise." "I said I'd ask you, that's all." "[MASK], you never tell me _anything_
HandfulOfDust	53	72181	72172	72225	Brown	By the way, I thought you were joining [MASK]'s." "I haven't heard anything from them. I don't know whether they've had an election yet." "Your father was a member." "I've an idea I shan't get in...
HandfulOfDust	50	72243	72194	72244	John	I don't know whether they've had an election yet." "Your father was a member." "I've an idea I shan't get in... anyway I couldn't really afford it." "I'm not happy about you, [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	41	72274	72245	72286	Margot	I'm not sure that things are working out as well as I hoped about Christmas-time." "There's my telephone. Perhaps it's [MASK]. She hasn't asked me to anything for weeks."
HandfulOfDust	48	72291	72287	72335	Brenda	But it was only [MASK]. "I'm afraid mother's got nothing for you at the shop," he said. "Oh well. I expect something will turn up. I could do with a little good luck just at the moment."
HandfulOfDust	43	72425	72409	72452	Veronica	"I asked them. What does it matter anyway? D'you want to come to [MASK]'s for the week-end?" "I'm not sure that I do." "_I'd_ like it."
HandfulOfDust	49	72466	72444	72493	Veronica	"_I'd_ like it." "It's a beastly little house--and I don't think [MASK] likes me. Who'll be there?" "I shall be." "Yes... well, I'll let you know."
HandfulOfDust	52	72517	72470	72522	Brenda	Who'll be there?" "I shall be." "Yes... well, I'll let you know." "Am I seeing you this evening?" "I'll let you know." "Oh dear," said [MASK] as she rang off.
HandfulOfDust	42	72851	72829	72871	Marjorie	"If I went there without him it would be a major bust-up... Come to think of it, [MASK]'s probably going. Well, I can always have sandwiches for dinner here. They make all kinds.
HandfulOfDust	50	72979	72970	73020	Brenda	Oh, I'm all right," said [MASK], and she thought, "It might occur to her to sock a girl a meal once in a way." * * * * * They walked for a fortnight, averaging about fifteen miles a day.
HandfulOfDust	52	73218	73167	73219	Rosa	"A discovery of genuine scientific value." Next day they waded through four streams at intervals of two miles, running alternately north and south. The chart began to have a mythical appearance. "Is there a name for any of these streams?" he asked [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	49	73865	73825	73874	Brenda	"Yes, mumsy." "You _would_ like it, wouldn't you?" "Me? Yes, I'd like it." "You've picked up that way of talking from [MASK]. It sounds ridiculous in a man."
HandfulOfDust	48	74291	74255	74303	Rosa	"The men must go out and shoot something." But they received the orders with expressionless, downcast faces and remained in camp. "No birds, no animals here," explained [MASK]. "All gone. Maybe they get some fish."
HandfulOfDust	45	74928	74912	74957	Tony	He sorted out the stores, dividing the necessary freight into two groups; he and [MASK] were to sit in separate boats and each had with him a rifle and ammunition, a camera, tinned rations, trade goods and his own luggage.
HandfulOfDust	52	74968	74958	75010	Indians	The third canoe, which would be manned solely by [MASK], was to hold the flour and rice, sugar and farine and the rations for the men. The canoes would not hold all the stores and an "emergency dump" was made a little way up the bank.
HandfulOfDust	45	75287	75253	75298	Rosa	"Understand?" But still she said nothing; she seemed to be looking over their heads into the dark forest, but her eyes were lost in shadow. "Listen, [MASK], all women and four men stay here in camp.
HandfulOfDust	41	75350	75339	75380	Rosa	Then back to Macushi country. Understand?" At last [MASK] spoke. "Macushi peoples no go with Pie-wie peoples." "I am not asking you to go _with_ Pie-wie people.
HandfulOfDust	51	75405	75402	75453	Rosa	Understand?" [MASK] raised her arm in an embracing circle which covered the camp and the road they had travelled and the broad savannahs behind them. "Macushi peoples there," she said. Then she raised the other arm and waved it downstream towards the hidden country.
HandfulOfDust	50	75481	75439	75489	Rosa	Then she raised the other arm and waved it downstream towards the hidden country. "Pie-wie peoples there," she said. "Macushi peoples no go with Pie-wie peoples." "Now listen, [MASK]. You are sensible, civilized woman.
HandfulOfDust	51	75530	75513	75564	Rosa	"You come with men in boats, I give you plenty, plenty cigarettes." [MASK] looked stolidly ahead of her and said nothing. "Listen. You will have your man and seven others to protect you. How can we talk with men without you?"
HandfulOfDust	49	75572	75543	75592	Rosa	You will have your man and seven others to protect you. How can we talk with men without you?" "Men no go," said [MASK]. "Of course the men will go. The only question is, will you come too?"
HandfulOfDust	52	75671	75632	75684	Tony	"You give me cigarette...." "It's going to be awkward if that woman doesn't come." "It's going to be much more awkward if none of them come," said [MASK]. * * * * * Next day the boats were ready.
HandfulOfDust	49	75928	75882	75931	Rosa	"Tell the men what I told you last night. Eight men to come in boats, others wait here. You come in boats. All these stores stay here. All these stores go in boats. You tell men that." [MASK] said nothing.
HandfulOfDust	50	76065	76026	76076	Rosa	"They are a queer, timid lot. If you threaten them they take fright and disappear, leaving you stranded. Don't worry, I shall be able to persuade them." They could see [MASK] talking at the fireside but none of the group moved.
HandfulOfDust	50	76255	76236	76286	Rosa	They are afraid of Pie-wie people." "It is the cassava field," said [MASK]. "We must go back to dig the cassava. Otherwise it will be bad." "Listen. I want the men for one, two weeks.
HandfulOfDust	49	76454	76446	76495	Rosa	"You give me this," said [MASK] picking out a pale blue rosette, that had been made as a boat race favour. "Give me this," she repeated, rubbing some drops of scent into the palm of her hands and inhaling deeply.
HandfulOfDust	55	76515	76473	76528	Rosa	Give me this," she repeated, rubbing some drops of scent into the palm of her hands and inhaling deeply. "Each man can choose three things from this box if he comes in the boats." But [MASK] replied monotonously, "Macushi peoples dig cassava field just now."
HandfulOfDust	42	76781	76777	76819	Tony	For a moment, [MASK] was afraid that it would turn over or become stuck against a root, but the mechanism was unimpaired and by good chance there was a clear course. The effect exceeded anything that he had expected.
HandfulOfDust	52	77064	77054	77106	Tony	"We'd better get some supper," said [MASK]. They boiled water and made some cocoa, opened a tin of salmon and finished the peaches that were left over from mid-day. They lit their pipes and drew the sheaths of mosquito netting across their hammocks.
HandfulOfDust	53	77261	77251	77304	Brenda	"Let's have the window open," said [MASK]. "It's stuffy in here." The waiter drew back the curtains, opened the windows. "It's quite light," she added. "After five. Oughtn't we to go to bed?"
HandfulOfDust	50	77324	77287	77337	Beaver	," she added. "After five. Oughtn't we to go to bed?" "Yes." "Only another week and then all the parties will be over," said [MASK]. "Yes." "Well, let's go."
HandfulOfDust	44	77367	77326	77370	Daisy	"Yes." "Well, let's go." "All right. Can you pay? I just haven't any money." They had come on after the party, for breakfast at a club [MASK] had opened.
HandfulOfDust	51	77555	77512	77563	Brenda	You needn't bother to see me home." "Sure you don't mind? It _is_ miles out of the way and it's late." "There's no knowing what I mind." "[MASK], darling, for heaven's sake...
HandfulOfDust	48	78091	78058	78106	Tony	Only the cabouri fly and rare, immobile alligators menaced the peace of their days. They kept a constant scrutiny of the banks but saw no sign of human life. Then [MASK] developed fever. It came on him quite suddenly, during the fourth afternoon.
HandfulOfDust	54	78220	78218	78272	Tony	He told [MASK] to keep wrapped up in his blanket, but at intervals throughout that night he woke from sleep to find himself running with sweat; he was consumed with thirst and drank mug after mug of river water. Neither that evening nor next morning was he able to eat anything.
HandfulOfDust	56	78426	78424	78480	Tony	At dawn [MASK] slept for an hour and woke feeling slightly better; he was taking frequent doses of quinine and his ears were filled with a muffled sound as though he were holding those shells to them in which, he had been told in childhood, one could hear the beat of the sea.
HandfulOfDust	47	78658	78643	78690	Brenda	* * * * * It was late in the afternoon when he first saw [MASK]. For some time he had been staring intently at the odd shape amidships where the stores had been piled; then he realized that it was a human being. "
HandfulOfDust	50	78754	78711	78761	Tony	Silly of them to be scared by a toy. I suppose the others are following." "Yes, I expect so. Try and sit still." "Damned fool, being frightened of a toy mouse," [MASK] said derisively to the woman amidships.
HandfulOfDust	43	78768	78762	78805	Brenda	Then he saw that it was [MASK]. "I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't see it was you. You wouldn't be frightened of a toy mouse." But she did not answer him.
HandfulOfDust	53	78926	78884	78937	Brenda	D'you know, I once saw a questionnaire that people had to fill in when they applied for a job in an American firm, and one of the things they had to answer was "Have you poise?"" [MASK] was at the top of the bank waiting for him.
HandfulOfDust	52	79000	78980	79032	Brenda	"Just sit quiet here while I sling your hammock." "Yes, I'll sit here with [MASK]. I am so glad she could come. She must have caught the three-eighteen." She was with him all that night and all the next day.
HandfulOfDust	49	79181	79176	79225	Tony	"Grand," said [MASK], but when he got out of his hammock he found he could not stand without help. "Of course, I haven't eaten anything. I expect it will be a day or two before I'm really well."
HandfulOfDust	54	79268	79259	79313	Tony	"See if you can drink this." [MASK] drank it with pleasure and ate some biscuits. "Are we going on to-day?" he asked. "We'll think about it." He took the mugs down to the bank and washed them in the river.
HandfulOfDust	57	79515	79472	79529	Tony	If only we were at a village...." "I'm afraid I'm being a great nuisance." "That's not the point. The thing is to find what is best for us to do." But [MASK] felt too tired to think; he dozed for an hour or so.
HandfulOfDust	51	79574	79557	79608	Tony	(He had marked this place on his map _Temporary Emergency Base Camp_.) [MASK] watched him listlessly. Presently he said, "Look here, why don't you leave me here and go down the river for help?" "I thought of that.
HandfulOfDust	49	79650	79636	79685	Tony	* * * * * When he was next able to observe things, [MASK] noted that there was a tarpaulin over his head, slung to the tree-trunks. He asked, "How long have we been here?" "Only three days."
HandfulOfDust	53	79803	79754	79807	Tony	I shall be able to get a long way in the canoe now it's empty. Lie quiet. Don't move from the hammock. I shall be back before night. I hope with some Indians to help." "All right," said [MASK] and fell asleep.
HandfulOfDust	47	80756	80713	80760	Brenda	In any case it would be a prolonged, costly and slightly undignified proceeding." "Oh, I see... well, that's that, isn't it?" "It certainly looks as though it were." [MASK] rose to go.
HandfulOfDust	47	80987	80970	81017	Tony	And she went out alone into the sunshine. * * * * * All that day [MASK] lay alone, fitfully oblivious of the passage of time. He slept a little; once or twice he left his hammock and found himself weak and dizzy.
HandfulOfDust	54	82202	82162	82216	Winnie	Of the tenders submitted hers was by far the most expensive but I understand that her plans include a chromium-plated wall on the south side of the village..." "...and two breakfasts," prompted [MASK]. "...and two breakfasts for the men engaged on the work.
HandfulOfDust	47	82250	82204	82251	Reggie	"...and two breakfasts for the men engaged on the work. Those in favour of the motion will make a clucking sound in imitation of hens, those against will say bow-wow." "A most improper proceeding," said [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	42	82268	82252	82294	Brenda	"What will the servants think?" "We have got to do something until [MASK] has been told." "...Me? I'm all right." "Then I take it the motion is carried."
HandfulOfDust	50	82404	82378	82428	Tony	"He ate two breakfasts." "...by an overwhelming majority." "Why are you all changing your clothes?" asked [MASK], for they were putting on hunting coats. "For the lawn meet. Hounds are meeting here to-day."
HandfulOfDust	43	82645	82621	82664	Ben	"I will send the order to the stables, sir." "But I don't want the pony. I told [MASK] to sell her." "You will have to ride to the smoking-room, sir.
HandfulOfDust	52	82749	82742	82794	Tony	Looking up from the card table, [MASK] saw beyond the trees the ramparts and battlement of the City; it was quite near him. From the turret of the gatehouse a heraldic banner floated in the tropic breeze. He struggled into an upright position and threw aside his blankets.
HandfulOfDust	52	83455	83439	83491	Brenda	"The others won't stop. They keep bicycling by... I'm tired... [MASK] was with me at first but she was frightened by a mechanical mouse, so she took the canoe and went off. She said she would come back that evening but she didn't.
HandfulOfDust	56	83799	83745	83801	Last	"Very kind of you... rotten thing for a man to have his wife go away in a canoe. That was a long time ago. Nothing to eat since." Presently he said, "I say, you're English. I'm English too. My name is [MASK]."
HandfulOfDust	51	83836	83836	83887	Tony	[MASK] looked round him. "Are you all English?" "Yes, all of us." "That dark girl married a Moor... It's very lucky I met you all. I suppose you're some kind of cycling club?" "Yes."
HandfulOfDust	50	83985	83937	83987	Messinger	It's not very much farther." "All right... I suppose you would have some difficulty getting petrol here." They went very slowly, but at length reached the house. "Lie there in the hammock." "That's what [MASK] said.
HandfulOfDust	58	84434	84429	84487	Tony	* * * * * [MASK]'s recovery was slow. At first, days of lucidity alternated with delirium; then his temperature dropped and he was conscious even when most ill. The days of fever grew less frequent, finally occurring in the normal system of the tropics, between long periods of comparative health.
HandfulOfDust	49	84796	84762	84811	Tony	He was a man of education. Can you read?" "Yes, of course." "It is not everyone who is so fortunate. I cannot." [MASK] laughed apologetically. "But I suppose you haven't much opportunity here."
HandfulOfDust	49	85118	85090	85139	Dickens	I've never really thought about it much." "I have thought about it a _great_ deal and I still do not know... [MASK] did." "I suppose so." "Oh yes, it is apparent in all his books.
HandfulOfDust	52	85369	85364	85416	Dickens	"You are fond of [MASK]?" "Why, yes, of course. More than fond, far more. You see, they are the only books I have ever heard. My father used to read them and then later the black man... and now you.
HandfulOfDust	52	85459	85417	85469	Dickens	I have heard them all several times by now but I never get tired; there is always more to be learned and noticed, so many characters, so many changes of scene, so many words... I have all [MASK]'s books here except those that the ants devoured.
HandfulOfDust	47	85491	85470	85517	Tony	It takes a long time to read them all--more than two years." "Well," said [MASK] lightly, "they will well last out my visit." "Oh, I hope not. It is delightful to start again.
HandfulOfDust	42	85573	85551	85593	Brenda	He had always rather enjoyed reading aloud and in the first year of marriage had shared several books in this way with [MASK], until one day, in a moment of frankness, she remarked that it was torture to her.
HandfulOfDust	57	85706	85697	85754	Tony	He would frequently interrupt with questions; not as [MASK] would have imagined about the circumstances of the story--such things as the procedure of the Lord Chancellor's Court or the social conventions of the time, though they must have been unintelligible, did not concern him--but always about the characters. "
HandfulOfDust	46	86076	86056	86102	Tony	One day, running his thumb through the pages of _Bleak House_ that remained to be read, [MASK] said, "We still have a lot to get through. I hope I shall be able to finish it before I go."
HandfulOfDust	51	86289	86239	86290	Dickens	I said, how soon do you think I shall be able to get a boat? I appreciate all your kindness to me more than I can say, but..." "My friend, any kindness I may have shown is amply repaid by your reading of [MASK].
HandfulOfDust	50	86538	86517	86567	Tony	"You might have told me." "Did I not mention it? I forgot." Next morning [MASK] went out alone while his host was busy, and, looking as aimless as he could, strolled across the savannah to the group of Indian houses.
HandfulOfDust	44	86824	86784	86828	Dombey	"So they gave me to understand... and now if you have finished your meal perhaps we might have another chapter. I am quite absorbed in the book." * * * * * They finished _[MASK] and Son_.
HandfulOfDust	52	87793	87760	87812	Indians	You may not like it but you should try some. We will go across to this man's home to-night." Accordingly after supper they joined a party of [MASK] that were assembled round the fire in one of the huts at the other side of the savannah.
HandfulOfDust	48	88224	88217	88265	Rotten	How do you feel?" "[MASK]. That drink doesn't seem to agree with me." "I will give you something to make you better. The forest has remedies for everything; to make you awake and to make you sleep."
HandfulOfDust	43	88780	88754	88797	Molly	She had been feeding the Angora rabbits. On the gravel in front of the house the new memorial stood, shrouded in a flag. [MASK] propped the motor-cycle against the wall of the drawbridge and ran in to breakfast.
HandfulOfDust	51	88895	88847	88898	Tony	When things were easier he would extend the household; meanwhile the dining-hall and the library were added to the state apartments which were kept locked and shuttered; the family lived in the morning-room, the smoking-room and what had been [MASK]'s study.
HandfulOfDust	46	89141	89135	89181	Agnes	Tricky birds, foxes." [MASK] came next; she was a neat, circumspect child of twelve, with large grave eyes behind her goggles. She kissed her father and mother and said, "I'm sorry if I'm late."
HandfulOfDust	45	89333	89303	89348	Jock	She's very sorry but she can't get down here for the dedication." "Oh." There was a general silence. "She says that [MASK] has a three-line whip for this afternoon." "Oh."
HandfulOfDust	42	89393	89374	89416	Molly	There was another pause. "Well, I think it's a jolly good thing," said [MASK]. "She couldn't show much widowly grief. It didn't take her long to get hitched up again."
HandfulOfDust	52	89949	89922	89974	Chivers	He disengaged himself from the family and hurried up to change out of his dark clothes. Within ten minutes he was in his car driving to [MASK]' farm. Before luncheon he was back with the rabbits. They were skinned and tied round the feet into bundles of four.
