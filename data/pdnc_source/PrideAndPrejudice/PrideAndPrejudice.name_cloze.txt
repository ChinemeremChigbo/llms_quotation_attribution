PrideAndPrejudice	44	287	279	323	Bingley	"What is his name?" "[MASK]." "Is he married or single?" "Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	798	759	808	Lizzy	But you are always giving _her_ the preference." "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but [MASK] has something more of quickness than her sisters."
PrideAndPrejudice	52	1632	1581	1633	Mary	"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you, [MASK]?
PrideAndPrejudice	42	3043	3040	3082	Darcy	"Come, [MASK]," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance." "I certainly shall not.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	3154	3111	3160	Bingley	Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with." "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried [MASK], "for a kingdom!
PrideAndPrejudice	46	3771	3733	3779	Jane	I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with [MASK] as she was going down the dance.
PrideAndPrejudice	53	4008	3995	4048	Lizzy	"But I can assure you," she added, "that [MASK] does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!
PrideAndPrejudice	47	4183	4175	4222	Elizabeth	"He is also handsome," replied [MASK], "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete." "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.
PrideAndPrejudice	59	4572	4572	4631	Elizabeth	[MASK] listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	5215	5215	5256	Darcy	[MASK], on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	6258	6232	6280	Elizabeth	If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud." "That is very true," replied [MASK], "and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."
PrideAndPrejudice	44	6931	6911	6955	Bingley	In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels. [MASK] likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."
PrideAndPrejudice	48	7144	7134	7182	Elizabeth	"Your plan is a good one," replied [MASK], "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.
PrideAndPrejudice	44	7187	7183	7227	Jane	But these are not [MASK]'s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	7507	7460	7514	Charlotte	They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life." "You make me laugh, [MASK]; but it is not sound.
PrideAndPrejudice	56	10356	10317	10373	Elizabeth	"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night." "That would be a good scheme," said [MASK], "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home."
PrideAndPrejudice	56	10474	10445	10501	Elizabeth	"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them." "But if you have got them to-day," said [MASK], "my mother's purpose will be answered." She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	10502	10486	10527	Jane	She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. [MASK] was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	10855	10840	10891	Elizabeth	I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage." [MASK], feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative.
PrideAndPrejudice	57	10946	10897	10954	Jane	"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there." "I shall be very fit to see [MASK]--which is all I want."
PrideAndPrejudice	51	10963	10955	11006	Lizzy	"Is this a hint to me, [MASK]," said her father, "to send for the horses?" "No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	11026	11007	11057	Mary	I shall be back by dinner." "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed [MASK], "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	11565	11547	11596	Elizabeth	The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. [MASK] did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	11853	11830	11884	Jane	Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for [MASK] was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	12065	12060	12107	Louisa	"She did indeed, [MASK]. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"
PrideAndPrejudice	45	12324	12280	12325	Bingley	what could she mean by it? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum." "It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	46	12782	12756	12802	Elizabeth	She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else." "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried [MASK]; "I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."
PrideAndPrejudice	53	12909	12870	12923	Elizabeth	And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into." [MASK] assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.
PrideAndPrejudice	46	13307	13287	13333	Bingley	Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite." "It is amazing to me," said [MASK], "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are." "All young ladies accomplished!
PrideAndPrejudice	43	13416	13404	13447	Darcy	"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said [MASK], "has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	13646	13637	13687	Darcy	"All this she must possess," added [MASK], "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading." "I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	13894	13871	13922	Darcy	But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art." "Undoubtedly," replied [MASK], to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	14053	14053	14108	Bingley	[MASK] was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	14690	14662	14714	Elizabeth	At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here." "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said [MASK]. "You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her. "Oh! yes--
PrideAndPrejudice	56	14778	14753	14809	Lizzy	It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours." "[MASK]," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	14819	14810	14859	Bingley	"I did not know before," continued [MASK] immediately, "that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study." "Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at least that advantage."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	14866	14831	14880	Darcy	It must be an amusing study." "Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at least that advantage." "The country," said [MASK], "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	14967	14938	14980	Darcy	"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town." Every body was surprised; and [MASK], after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	15108	15073	15121	Darcy	They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either." "Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman," looking at [MASK], "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."
PrideAndPrejudice	48	15361	15318	15366	Charlotte	so genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter." "Did [MASK] dine with you?"
PrideAndPrejudice	41	15479	15453	15494	Bingley	so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend." "She seems a very pleasant young woman," said [MASK]. "Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	15526	15510	15552	Jane	I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, [MASK]--one does not often see any body better looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own partiality.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	15566	15553	15603	Gardiner	When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother [MASK]'s in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But however he did not.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	15636	15604	15655	Elizabeth	Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were." "And so ended his affection," said [MASK] impatiently. "There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	15689	15639	15690	Darcy	"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!" "I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	53	16098	16049	16102	Lydia	"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill." [MASK] declared herself satisfied.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	16891	16883	16933	Darcy	"Nothing is more deceitful," said [MASK], "than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast." "And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"
PrideAndPrejudice	53	17081	17076	17129	Bingley	"Nay," cried [MASK], "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	17293	17271	17312	Bingley	You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself." "I am exceedingly gratified," said [MASK], "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	18648	18620	18672	Elizabeth	Put them next to your great uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines. As for your [MASK]'s picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"
PrideAndPrejudice	49	18829	18828	18877	Elizabeth	But [MASK], who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, "No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good bye."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	18904	18874	18923	Jane	Good bye." She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. [MASK] was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	19027	18992	19034	Jane	Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. But when the gentlemen entered, [MASK] was no longer the first object.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	19713	19686	19731	Caroline	It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day." "Much more rational, my dear [MASK], I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."
PrideAndPrejudice	46	20158	20144	20190	Elizabeth	"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said [MASK]. "We can all plague and punish one another. Teaze him--laugh at him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."
PrideAndPrejudice	47	20218	20191	20238	Teaze	"But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_. [MASK] calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no--I feel he may defy us there.
PrideAndPrejudice	56	20381	20341	20397	Elizabeth--"there	The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke." "Certainly," replied [MASK] are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	20517	20479	20524	Elizabeth	"Such as vanity and pride." "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation." [MASK] turned away to hide a smile.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	20572	20570	20621	Darcy	"No"--said [MASK], "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	20682	20644	20695	Elizabeth	My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost for ever." "_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried [MASK]. "Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	22980	22935	22989	Mary	I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him." "In point of composition," said [MASK], "his letter does not seem defective.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	24541	24502	24549	Elizabeth	His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at [MASK], requiring no partner in his pleasure.
PrideAndPrejudice	57	27607	27601	27658	Lydia	At first there seemed danger of [MASK]'s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	27859	27814	27865	Elizabeth	A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy." [MASK] could not but look surprised.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	27952	27938	27985	Wickham	"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said [MASK], "as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	28096	28071	28122	Wickham	You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one." "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said [MASK], after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_
PrideAndPrejudice	57	28185	28162	28219	Wickham	"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." [MASK] only shook his head. "I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."
PrideAndPrejudice	50	28760	28754	28804	Elizabeth	"Good heavens!" cried [MASK]; "but how could _that_ be?--How could his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?" "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	29024	29024	29069	Elizabeth	[MASK] honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them. "But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"
PrideAndPrejudice	56	29292	29292	29348	Elizabeth	[MASK] was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being
PrideAndPrejudice	45	30600	30586	30631	Wickham	"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied [MASK]; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	31121	31112	31160	Jane	"Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear [MASK], what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."
PrideAndPrejudice	43	31708	31706	31749	Mary	And even [MASK] could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it. "While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
PrideAndPrejudice	56	34477	34446	34502	Darcy	She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in [MASK]'s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	35061	35029	35078	Jane	But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon." "No," replied [MASK], "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	36993	36972	37014	Mary	By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; [MASK] would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
PrideAndPrejudice	43	37186	37179	37222	Mary	He took the hint, and when [MASK] had finished her second song, said aloud, "That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."
PrideAndPrejudice	55	38677	38677	38732	Elizabeth	[MASK] would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	39442	39441	39483	fortune	To [MASK] I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	39717	39681	39730	Elizabeth	I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long." "Upon my word, Sir," cried [MASK], "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	41186	41167	41215	Lizzy	"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business." "Speak to [MASK] about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him." "Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion."
PrideAndPrejudice	50	41275	41270	41320	Elizabeth	Is it true?" [MASK] replied that it was. "Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?" "I have, Sir." "Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	41693	41686	41728	Lydia	She was met in the vestibule by [MASK], who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	42790	42758	42809	Elizabeth	He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over.--To [MASK], however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	43008	42982	43029	Elizabeth	The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and [MASK] saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
PrideAndPrejudice	59	43905	43855	43914	Charles	My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call [MASK] most capable of engaging any woman's heart.
PrideAndPrejudice	58	43984	43974	44032	Caroline	Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare that [MASK] neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?
PrideAndPrejudice	48	44379	44379	44427	Caroline	[MASK] is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself." "That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	44496	44487	44537	Elizabeth	"You must decide for yourself," said [MASK], "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."
PrideAndPrejudice	50	44544	44538	44588	Jane	"How can you talk so?"--said [MASK] faintly smiling,--"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate." "I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."
PrideAndPrejudice	42	44638	44630	44672	Caroline	It appeared to her merely the suggestion of [MASK]'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	44933	44907	44957	Charlotte	"It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express." [MASK] assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	45509	45466	45515	Charlotte	The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of [MASK]'s dying an old maid.
PrideAndPrejudice	43	46501	46500	46543	Elizabeth	But [MASK] had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	46743	46738	46779	Charlotte	She had always felt that [MASK]'s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	47226	47211	47265	Elizabeth	Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that [MASK] was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	49305	49298	49352	Jane	"You doubt me," cried [MASK], slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.
PrideAndPrejudice	53	49498	49493	49546	Elizabeth	"Nay," said [MASK], "this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body. _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	49675	49660	49705	Lizzy	It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!" "My dear [MASK], do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.
PrideAndPrejudice	56	49801	49768	49824	Charlotte	"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that [MASK] had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	49951	49936	49987	Jane	"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied [MASK], "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned _two_ instances.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	50702	50700	50742	Lizzy	So, [MASK]," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	50777	50724	50778	Jane	Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	49	51977	51949	51998	Jane	Is not general incivility the very essence of love?" "Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor [MASK]! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.
PrideAndPrejudice	56	52009	51979	52035	Lizzy	I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, [MASK]; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us?
PrideAndPrejudice	56	52060	52021	52077	Elizabeth	But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything." [MASK] was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.
PrideAndPrejudice	44	52272	52254	52298	Jane	"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not [MASK] correspond with the sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling." "She will drop the acquaintance entirely."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	53422	53396	53445	Elizabeth	At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him." "As I did the other day," said [MASK], with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	53904	53904	53945	Elizabeth	[MASK] could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	54474	54428	54480	Jane	After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow [MASK] to deceive herself no longer.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	55240	55240	55292	Elizabeth	[MASK] was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	55674	55661	55702	Charlotte	She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but [MASK], she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	56338	56312	56367	Jane	Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though [MASK] always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope, that they would not continue long.
PrideAndPrejudice	44	56749	56729	56773	Elizabeth	It only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling." "Well," cried [MASK], "have it as you choose. _He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."
PrideAndPrejudice	51	56904	56900	56951	Lizzy	"Take care, [MASK]; that speech savours strongly of disappointment." Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	56986	56978	57026	Elizabeth	No scheme could have been more agreeable to [MASK], and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour.
PrideAndPrejudice	56	57168	57155	57211	Elizabeth	Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to [MASK]; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
PrideAndPrejudice	53	57494	57494	57547	Elizabeth	[MASK] was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	58120	58078	58133	Maria	She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister [MASK] in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.
PrideAndPrejudice	53	58139	58134	58187	Charlotte	Her behaviour to my dear [MASK] is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."
PrideAndPrejudice	51	58636	58604	58655	Charlotte	Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!" "She is abominably rude to keep [MASK] out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?" "Oh!
PrideAndPrejudice	59	60238	60235	60294	Charlotte	She enquired into [MASK]'s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	60717	60683	60733	Elizabeth	How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education." [MASK] could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.
PrideAndPrejudice	56	61060	61057	61113	Ma'am	But really, [MASK], I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.
PrideAndPrejudice	53	61181	61142	61195	Elizabeth	"Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?" "With three younger sisters grown up," replied [MASK] smiling, "your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."
PrideAndPrejudice	57	62718	62718	62775	Elizabeth	[MASK] had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	62899	62884	62935	Elizabeth	At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of [MASK] after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added, "My eldest sister has been in town these three months.
PrideAndPrejudice	58	63232	63186	63244	Darcy	Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to [MASK], much more than to any other person in the room.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	63400	63349	63401	Fitzwilliam	_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out, "What is that you are saying, [MASK]?
PrideAndPrejudice	47	64466	64426	64473	Fitzwilliam	"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?" "I can answer your question," said [MASK], "without applying to him.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	64500	64486	64536	Darcy	"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said [MASK], "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."
PrideAndPrejudice	50	64543	64514	64564	Elizabeth	I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done." "My fingers," said [MASK], "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.
PrideAndPrejudice	57	64629	64582	64639	Darcy	But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution." [MASK] smiled and said, "You are perfectly right.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	65379	65379	65433	Elizabeth	[MASK] made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him. He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	65674	65621	65675	Elizabeth	"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance." "I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match," cried [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	41	65951	65912	65953	Kent	The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice, "Are you pleased with [MASK]?"
PrideAndPrejudice	52	67134	67130	67182	Darcy	"Yes--if [MASK] does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases." "And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	67441	67435	67482	Elizabeth	"Is this," thought [MASK], "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?
PrideAndPrejudice	50	67683	67645	67695	Darcy	And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true [MASK] spirit, she may like to have her own way."
PrideAndPrejudice	51	67956	67936	67987	Darcy	It was all conjecture." "What is it you mean?" "It is a circumstance which [MASK] of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."
PrideAndPrejudice	42	68145	68119	68161	Fitzwilliam	"And what arts did he use to separate them?" "He did not talk to me of his own arts," said [MASK] smiling. "He only told me, what I have now told you."
PrideAndPrejudice	50	68183	68177	68227	Fitzwilliam	After watching her a little, [MASK] asked her why she was so thoughtful. "I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"
PrideAndPrejudice	43	68340	68314	68357	Fitzwilliam	It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case." "That is not an unnatural surmise," said [MASK], "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."
PrideAndPrejudice	52	69325	69308	69360	Elizabeth	He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room. [MASK] was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began, "In vain have I struggled.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	69917	69869	69921	Elizabeth	His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to [MASK]'s feelings dreadful.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	70465	70426	70477	Darcy	In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?" "You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said [MASK] in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
PrideAndPrejudice	43	70525	70517	70560	Elizabeth	"And of your infliction," cried [MASK] with energy. "You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	70612	70590	70640	Darcy	and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule." "And this," cried [MASK], as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
PrideAndPrejudice	55	71830	71808	71863	Madam	It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:-- "Be not alarmed, [MASK], on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	72997	72980	73030	Bingley	He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But [MASK] has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	74352	74337	74391	Georgiana	I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then [MASK], unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	75275	75274	75329	Wickham	What [MASK] had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	75349	75330	75379	Wickham	But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of [MASK]'s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.
PrideAndPrejudice	46	76299	76286	76332	Wickham	That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even [MASK] had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	76633	76583	76637	Charlotte	Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what [MASK]'s opinion had always
PrideAndPrejudice	42	77308	77289	77331	Darcy	But so they always are. The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but [MASK] seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year. His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."
PrideAndPrejudice	51	77450	77435	77486	Elizabeth	"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied [MASK], "but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town next Saturday." "Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	77896	77867	77914	Bromley	"Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?--Oh! [MASK], of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."
PrideAndPrejudice	41	78421	78394	78435	Jane	How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, [MASK] had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
PrideAndPrejudice	46	78445	78436	78482	Wickham	When to these recollections was added the developement of [MASK]'s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	79161	79159	79200	Charlotte	My dear [MASK] and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other."
PrideAndPrejudice	43	79201	79190	79233	Elizabeth	We seem to have been designed for each other." [MASK] could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	79421	79415	79460	Maria	He then handed her in, [MASK] followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings. "
PrideAndPrejudice	54	79498	79461	79515	Elizabeth	But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here." [MASK] made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	79522	79516	79563	Maria	"Good gracious!" cried [MASK], after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!" "A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	80205	80185	80226	Mamma	It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all. [MASK] would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"
PrideAndPrejudice	45	80301	80289	80334	Lydia	"Now I have got some news for you," said [MASK], as they sat down to table. "What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."
PrideAndPrejudice	53	80354	80354	80407	Lydia	[MASK] laughed, and said, "Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow!
PrideAndPrejudice	44	80538	80507	80551	Jane	"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him." "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said [MASK]. "I am sure there is not on _his_.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	80681	80671	80723	Lydia	"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried [MASK]. "I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	80777	80745	80795	Jane	Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. [MASK] will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three and twenty!
PrideAndPrejudice	42	81558	81521	81563	Lydia	They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for _me_. I should infinitely prefer a book." But of this answer [MASK] heard not a word.
PrideAndPrejudice	44	81655	81643	81687	Wickham	There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing [MASK] again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.
PrideAndPrejudice	46	81751	81751	81797	Elizabeth	[MASK] saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last. CHAPTER XVII.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	81966	81961	82008	Elizabeth	"Indeed," replied [MASK], "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?" "Blame you!
PrideAndPrejudice	53	82025	81992	82045	Wickham	You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?" "Blame you! Oh, no." "But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of [MASK]." "No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."
PrideAndPrejudice	42	82130	82128	82170	Darcy	Nor was [MASK]'s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	82179	82148	82196	Elizabeth	Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other. "This will not do," said [MASK]. "You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	82592	82560	82615	Lizzy	One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty." "[MASK], when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	82651	82627	82676	Jane	I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no [MASK] to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh!
PrideAndPrejudice	56	82769	82717	82773	Wickham	But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point, on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand [MASK]'s character."
PrideAndPrejudice	50	82907	82900	82950	Wickham	I am not equal to it. [MASK] will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is. Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	83010	82967	83018	Elizabeth	To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate." The tumult of [MASK]'s mind was allayed by this conversation.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	83045	83019	83071	Jane	She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in [MASK], whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure.
PrideAndPrejudice	53	83163	83137	83190	Bingley	And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what [MASK] may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"
PrideAndPrejudice	44	83214	83174	83218	Jane	The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!" She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits. [MASK] was not happy.
PrideAndPrejudice	57	83521	83484	83541	Jane	Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure [MASK] will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done."
PrideAndPrejudice	43	83562	83559	83602	Lizzy	"Well, [MASK]," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep?
PrideAndPrejudice	48	83603	83594	83642	Charlotte	And what sort of table do they keep? [MASK] is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	83709	83698	83747	Longbourn	And so, I suppose, they often talk of having [MASK] when your father is dead. They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens." "It was a subject which they could not mention before me."
PrideAndPrejudice	53	83955	83930	83983	Lizzy	What are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so, [MASK]?" Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	84226	84200	84248	Lydia	This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and [MASK] to each other, and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	84549	84539	84590	Lydia	He heard her attentively, and then said, "[MASK] will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	84717	84672	84721	Lydia	But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by [MASK]'s folly."
PrideAndPrejudice	54	84779	84728	84782	Lydia	I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark [MASK]'s character.
PrideAndPrejudice	59	84920	84865	84924	Kitty	A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger [MASK] is also comprehended.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	84929	84925	84979	Lydia	She will follow wherever [MASK] leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"
PrideAndPrejudice	52	85179	85149	85201	Elizabeth	At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life." With this answer [MASK] was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	85251	85221	85276	Lydia	She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition. Had [MASK] and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	85889	85884	85939	Wickham	"Indeed!" cried [MASK] with a look which did not escape her. "And pray may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?
PrideAndPrejudice	51	85973	85940	85991	Elizabeth	for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials." "Oh, no!" said [MASK]. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was."
PrideAndPrejudice	46	86285	86285	86331	Elizabeth	[MASK] could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	86359	86332	86379	Elizabeth	The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish [MASK]; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	87782	87782	87830	Elizabeth	[MASK] was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	87855	87843	87890	Pemberley	It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of [MASK] and its owner. "But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."
PrideAndPrejudice	50	88284	88244	88294	Wickham	"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt. "A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected. [MASK] passed all his youth there, you know."
PrideAndPrejudice	53	88397	88355	88408	Elizabeth	"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country." [MASK] said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	88759	88733	88780	Elizabeth	They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent. [MASK]'s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.
PrideAndPrejudice	58	88889	88834	88892	Elizabeth	It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. [MASK] was delighted.
PrideAndPrejudice	53	88942	88893	88946	Pemberley	She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of [MASK] might be something!
PrideAndPrejudice	52	89687	89675	89727	Ma'am	"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, [MASK]?" "Yes, very handsome." "I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	90017	90017	90066	Elizabeth	[MASK] could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so." "I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other.
PrideAndPrejudice	46	90067	90067	90113	Elizabeth	[MASK] thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	90263	90218	90267	Elizabeth	But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world." [MASK] almost stared at her.--"Can
PrideAndPrejudice	51	90521	90471	90522	Elizabeth	Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men." "In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	57	91129	91119	91176	Elizabeth	As they walked across the lawn towards the river, [MASK] turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	92447	92447	92499	Elizabeth	[MASK], however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.
PrideAndPrejudice	44	92963	92963	93007	Elizabeth	[MASK] said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed?
PrideAndPrejudice	41	93869	93833	93874	Elizabeth	"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with [MASK] was very trifling."
PrideAndPrejudice	50	94018	93981	94031	Elizabeth	"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds." [MASK] felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	95044	95043	95084	Elizabeth	All [MASK]'s anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	95474	95444	95499	Jane	On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of [MASK], not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.
PrideAndPrejudice	46	97294	97294	97340	Georgiana	[MASK]'s reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	98462	98431	98476	Elizabeth	Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from [MASK], seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	98976	98971	99018	Darcy	"Yes," replied [MASK], who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."
PrideAndPrejudice	41	99352	99339	99380	Lizzy	It was to this effect: "Since writing the above, dearest [MASK], something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	99439	99438	99480	Kitty	To [MASK], however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	99593	99562	99604	Lizzy	They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear [MASK], they must have passed within ten miles of us.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	99616	99616	99668	Lydia	[MASK] left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written."
PrideAndPrejudice	56	100136	100098	100154	Lydia	Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of [MASK]'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	100270	100264	100318	Lizzy	I am truly glad, dearest [MASK], that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	100582	100552	100600	Lydia	Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by [MASK]'s situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	100863	100835	100886	Longbourn	"There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from [MASK]." She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	100887	100866	100915	Darcy	She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. [MASK], in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length, she spoke again.
PrideAndPrejudice	59	101004	100982	101041	Darcy	She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever." [MASK] was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew what he was.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	101096	101064	101111	Darcy	Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all, all too late now." "I am grieved, indeed," cried [MASK]; "grieved--shocked. But is it certain, absolutely certain?"
PrideAndPrejudice	52	101241	101209	101261	Darcy	How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!" [MASK] shook his head in silent acquiesence. "When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh!
PrideAndPrejudice	51	101296	101249	101300	Darcy	"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched, mistake!" [MASK] made no answer.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	102719	102708	102759	Elizabeth	CHAPTER V. "I have been thinking it over again, [MASK]," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	102926	102921	102971	Lizzy	Can you, yourself, [MASK], so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?" "Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so!
PrideAndPrejudice	52	103166	103127	103179	Jane	"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by [MASK]'s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	103200	103190	103232	Lydia	He cannot afford it. And what claims has [MASK], what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?
PrideAndPrejudice	57	103589	103546	103603	Wickham	She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that [MASK] has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."
PrideAndPrejudice	56	103983	103976	104032	Jane	As that was the case, neither [MASK], to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?
PrideAndPrejudice	48	104543	104537	104585	Jane	"Not yet," replied [MASK]. "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well." "Is my father in town?" "Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word."
PrideAndPrejudice	58	104902	104859	104917	Lydia	The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from [MASK] or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	105536	105532	105581	Lydia	And tell my dear [MASK], not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."
PrideAndPrejudice	54	105835	105782	105836	Kitty	The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	59	106289	106279	106338	Denny	"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ [MASK] denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."
PrideAndPrejudice	44	106703	106695	106739	HARRIET	These were the contents: "MY DEAR [MASK]," "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	106859	106854	106906	Pratt	Pray make my excuses to [MASK], for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	107385	107374	107422	Elizabeth	"She had better have stayed at home," cried [MASK]; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	107915	107879	107934	Wickham	Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of [MASK]'s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.
PrideAndPrejudice	53	108721	108669	108722	Hertfordshire	It was as follows: "MY DEAR SIR," "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	50	109230	109203	109253	Lydia	And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by [MASK]'s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	109859	109832	109881	Elizabeth	It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it." "You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied [MASK]. "You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it!
PrideAndPrejudice	50	109884	109861	109911	Lizzy	"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, [MASK], let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
PrideAndPrejudice	43	109997	109986	110029	Lizzy	Then, after a short silence, he continued, "[MASK], I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."
PrideAndPrejudice	44	110110	110070	110114	Kitty	Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can,--or, perhaps, I may defer it, till [MASK] runs away."
PrideAndPrejudice	55	110174	110172	110227	Kitty	No, [MASK], I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	110258	110228	110273	Kitty	And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner." [MASK], who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	110728	110681	110735	Elizabeth	"Well, and what news does it bring? good or bad?" "What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it." [MASK] impatiently caught it from his hand.
PrideAndPrejudice	43	110867	110831	110874	Jane	The particulars, I reserve till we meet. It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them both----" "Then it is, as I always hoped," cried [MASK]; "they are married!"
PrideAndPrejudice	57	110875	110875	110932	Elizabeth	[MASK] read on; "I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	111265	111232	111283	Elizabeth	I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on. Your's, &c." "EDW. GARDINER." "Is it possible!" cried [MASK], when she had finished. "Can it be possible that he will marry her?"
PrideAndPrejudice	41	111285	111272	111313	Wickham	"Can it be possible that he will marry her?" "[MASK] is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you."
PrideAndPrejudice	54	111448	111424	111478	Elizabeth	And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house. "And may I ask?" said [MASK], "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with." "Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."
PrideAndPrejudice	59	111563	111514	111573	Jane	But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him." "Money! my uncle!" cried [MASK], "what do you mean, Sir?"
PrideAndPrejudice	54	111619	111611	111665	Elizabeth	"That is very true," said [MASK]; "though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	111685	111653	111702	Wickham	Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this." "No," said her father, "[MASK]'s a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.
PrideAndPrejudice	46	111796	111765	111811	Elizabeth	Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room. "And they are really to be married!" cried [MASK], as soon as they were by themselves. "How strange this is!
PrideAndPrejudice	52	112089	112073	112125	Jane	"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said [MASK]: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	112171	112162	112217	Elizabeth	"Their conduct has been such," replied [MASK], "as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it." It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	112434	112429	112481	Lydia	"My dear, dear [MASK]!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage every thing. How I long to see her!
PrideAndPrejudice	50	112748	112746	112796	Jane	My dear [MASK], I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	112825	112797	112846	Jane	She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not [MASK], though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	113759	113719	113767	Lydia	His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with [MASK], to send any message to her.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	113964	113947	113999	Jane	The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since [MASK] was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	114329	114295	114337	Wickham	She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with [MASK], a fortnight before they took place.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	115878	115856	115901	Wickham	Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to [MASK], who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	116031	116031	116080	Wickham	[MASK] was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	116222	116198	116239	Lydia	They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and [MASK] led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	116325	116279	116328	Jane	Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was." Her father lifted up his eyes. [MASK] was distressed.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	116736	116704	116756	Lydia	What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go." "Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear [MASK], I don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"
PrideAndPrejudice	51	117139	117135	117186	Wickham	He was her dear [MASK] on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	117264	117228	117280	Elizabeth	You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?" "No really," replied [MASK]; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."
PrideAndPrejudice	51	117444	117394	117445	Wickham	And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	44	117998	117969	118013	Lydia	She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what [MASK] had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	118087	118062	118104	Lydia	Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which [MASK] seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."
PrideAndPrejudice	42	118580	118566	118608	Wickham	The motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that [MASK]'s worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	119029	119008	119050	Wickham	She cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving [MASK]. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	119079	119051	119092	Wickham	Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with [MASK], he easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	119126	119093	119135	Lydia	He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of [MASK]'s flight, on her own folly alone.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	119239	119228	119277	Wickham	But he found, in reply to this question, that [MASK] still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	119291	119258	119309	Wickham	Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. [MASK] of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.
PrideAndPrejudice	43	119520	119510	119553	Lizzy	But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, [MASK], that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.
PrideAndPrejudice	58	119811	119773	119831	Wickham	The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that [MASK]'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.
PrideAndPrejudice	42	119876	119865	119907	Lizzy	But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear [MASK], you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	120217	120188	120242	Lizzy	He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear [MASK], if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	120666	120612	120667	Wickham	But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	51	120674	120668	120719	Wickham	Brother-in-law of [MASK]! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had to be sure done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.
PrideAndPrejudice	53	120816	120811	120864	Lydia	They owed the restoration of [MASK], her character, every thing to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	121942	121937	121985	Lydia	"Oh! my dear [MASK]," she cried, "when shall we meet again?" "Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years perhaps." "Write to me very often, my dear."
PrideAndPrejudice	45	122203	122181	122226	Lydia	"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single." "It is no such thing. [MASK] does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	122733	122693	122742	Elizabeth	I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks." [MASK] did not know what to make of it.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	122876	122853	122902	Elizabeth	In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, [MASK] could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	123220	123197	123251	Jane	As the day of his arrival drew near, "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said [MASK] to her sister. "It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	123304	123290	123342	Elizabeth	"I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied [MASK]; "but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."
PrideAndPrejudice	41	123496	123484	123525	Kitty	"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said [MASK]; "who can it be?" "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know."
PrideAndPrejudice	42	123531	123505	123547	Kitty	"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know." "La!" replied [MASK], "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	124134	124101	124156	Bingley	But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture. [MASK], she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.
PrideAndPrejudice	55	124341	124300	124355	Jane	But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at [MASK], as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	124855	124831	124876	Bingley	It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked [MASK], whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.
PrideAndPrejudice	46	124942	124942	124988	Elizabeth	[MASK]'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	125002	124989	125040	Jane	At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make [MASK] or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion. "The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	125163	125137	125188	Jane	He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. [MASK] was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	125314	125284	125336	Bingley	I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement." [MASK] looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	125596	125547	125597	Elizabeth	Teazing, teazing, man! I will think no more about him." Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	43	125675	125635	125678	Elizabeth	I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance." "Yes, very indifferent indeed," said [MASK], laughingly.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	125691	125688	125735	Lizzy	"My dear [MASK], you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now." "I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever." * * * * *
PrideAndPrejudice	50	125888	125858	125908	Jane	Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but [MASK] happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	126150	126134	126186	Elizabeth	Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to [MASK]'s mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.
PrideAndPrejudice	46	126432	126432	126478	Darcy	[MASK] had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!
PrideAndPrejudice	56	126667	126617	126673	Elizabeth	She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to [MASK] again, he walked away.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	127153	127152	127197	Lizzy	"[MASK], you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	127697	127675	127727	Jane	Come be quick, be quick! where is your sash my dear?" But when her mother was gone, [MASK] would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters. The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	127863	127837	127886	Kitty	" She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to [MASK], "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	128251	128232	128281	Bingley	The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in [MASK], that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	128314	128314	128359	Elizabeth	[MASK], who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	128591	128565	128612	Elizabeth	she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not every body as happy?" [MASK]'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	128624	128613	128663	Jane	Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to [MASK]. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present. "I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	128699	128664	128718	Lizzy	"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! [MASK], to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!
PrideAndPrejudice	49	128836	128818	128867	Bingley	the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!" In a few minutes she was joined by [MASK], whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose. "Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	128909	128875	128922	Elizabeth	She will be down in a moment I dare say." He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. [MASK] honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.
PrideAndPrejudice	46	129161	129120	129166	Jane	Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said, "[MASK], I congratulate you.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	129176	129167	129217	Jane	You will be a very happy woman." [MASK] went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness. "You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.
PrideAndPrejudice	41	129455	129455	129496	Jane	[MASK] was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	129712	129663	129713	Elizabeth	"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible." "I suspected as much," replied [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	42	129864	129858	129900	Lizzy	"Would you believe it, [MASK], that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"
PrideAndPrejudice	43	129928	129901	129944	Jane	"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty." This naturally introduced a panegyric from [MASK] on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.
PrideAndPrejudice	43	130009	130006	130049	Lizzy	"Oh! [MASK], why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but such another man for you!"
PrideAndPrejudice	51	130915	130883	130934	Elizabeth	"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage." [MASK] obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.
PrideAndPrejudice	58	131008	130994	131052	Elizabeth	They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; [MASK] was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable. "How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	131104	131088	131136	Elizabeth	Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come." [MASK] looked with unaffected astonishment. "Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."
PrideAndPrejudice	54	131343	131331	131385	Elizabeth	"If you believed it impossible to be true," said [MASK], colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?" "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."
PrideAndPrejudice	46	132141	132096	132142	Elizabeth	You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us." "These are heavy misfortunes," replied [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	53	132523	132491	132544	Elizabeth	But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition." "Whatever my connections may be," said [MASK], "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."
PrideAndPrejudice	50	133233	133197	133247	Elizabeth	You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world." "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied [MASK], "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	133441	133428	133476	Elizabeth	You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased." [MASK] made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	133885	133869	133920	Elizabeth	From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to [MASK] that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	134286	134254	134306	Lizzy	The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand. "[MASK]," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."
PrideAndPrejudice	45	134730	134723	134768	Lizzy	" "Can you possibly guess, [MASK], who is meant by this?" "This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	134782	134769	134819	Elizabeth	Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin [MASK], and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of."
PrideAndPrejudice	50	134970	134965	135015	Elizabeth	It is admirable!" [MASK] tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her. "Are you not diverted?" "Oh! yes.
PrideAndPrejudice	51	135371	135343	135394	Elizabeth	For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?" "Oh!" cried [MASK], "I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!" "Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	135538	135507	135555	Elizabeth	To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. [MASK] had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.
PrideAndPrejudice	46	136182	136164	136210	Elizabeth	Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_." [MASK] was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me.
PrideAndPrejudice	59	136220	136192	136251	April	After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last [MASK], tell me so at once. _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."
PrideAndPrejudice	50	136636	136636	136686	Elizabeth	[MASK] coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	136762	136744	136793	Elizabeth	"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said [MASK]. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility."
PrideAndPrejudice	49	137030	137006	137055	Darcy	These recollections will not do at all. I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it." [MASK] mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you think better of me?
PrideAndPrejudice	53	137220	137211	137264	Darcy	"When I wrote that letter," replied [MASK], "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit." "The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.
PrideAndPrejudice	48	137586	137561	137609	Elizabeth	Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest [MASK]! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	138116	138105	138154	Elizabeth	"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said [MASK]. "Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen." "That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much."
PrideAndPrejudice	51	138291	138291	138342	Elizabeth	[MASK] could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend. "Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?" "From the former.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	138390	138343	138395	Bingley	I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection." "And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him." "It did. [MASK] is most unaffectedly modest.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	138565	138538	138588	Bingley	She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of [MASK], which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	138783	138759	138808	Jane	She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but [MASK]; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
PrideAndPrejudice	54	138926	138877	138931	Jane	My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged." [MASK] looked at her doubtingly.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	138935	138932	138981	Lizzy	"Oh, [MASK]! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him." "You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.
PrideAndPrejudice	45	139053	139048	139093	Lizzy	"My dear, dear [MASK], I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?" "There can be no doubt of that.
PrideAndPrejudice	50	139118	139085	139135	Jane	"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, [MASK]? Shall you like to have such a brother?" "Very, very much.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	139140	139120	139167	Bingley	Shall you like to have such a brother?" "Very, very much. Nothing could give either [MASK] or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough?
PrideAndPrejudice	48	139170	139146	139194	Lizzy	But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, [MASK]! do any thing rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"
PrideAndPrejudice	50	139244	139195	139245	Bingley	"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all." "What do you mean?" "Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do [MASK].
PrideAndPrejudice	45	139905	139892	139937	Jane	But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for [MASK]'s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."
PrideAndPrejudice	47	140199	140186	140233	Kitty	In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with [MASK]; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.
PrideAndPrejudice	52	140248	140228	140280	Lizzy	" She was gone directly. Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. "[MASK]," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"
PrideAndPrejudice	41	140371	140339	140380	Jane	"Or in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than [MASK]. But will they make you happy?"
PrideAndPrejudice	50	140390	140381	140431	Elizabeth	"Have you any other objection," said [MASK], "than your belief of my indifference?" "None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."
PrideAndPrejudice	51	140493	140456	140507	Lizzy	Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms." "[MASK]," said her father, "I have given him my consent.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	140566	140561	140610	Lizzy	I know your disposition, [MASK]. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.
PrideAndPrejudice	49	140833	140814	140863	Darcy	He heard her with astonishment. "This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, [MASK] did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better.
PrideAndPrejudice	47	141256	141233	141280	Jane	how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! [MASK]'s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome!
PrideAndPrejudice	51	141361	141326	141377	Elizabeth	Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted." This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and [MASK], rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.
