TheInvisibleMan	55	289	278	333	Millie	As soon as the bacon was well under way, and [MASK], her lymphatic maid, had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen expressions of contempt, she carried the cloth, plates, and glasses into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost _ clat_.
TheInvisibleMan	43	773	739	782	Millie	That girl!" she said. "There! I clean forgot it. It s her being so long!" And while she herself finished mixing the mustard, she gave [MASK] a few verbal stabs for her excessive slowness.
TheInvisibleMan	48	1691	1645	1693	Millie	Perhaps his mouth was hurt too maybe." She turned round, as one who suddenly remembers. "Bless my soul alive!" she said, going off at a tangent; "ain t you done them taters _yet_, [MASK]?"
TheInvisibleMan	51	2065	2043	2094	Tom	"But they take long enough to get well, don t they? ... There was my sister s son, [MASK], jest cut his arm with a scythe, tumbled on it in the ayfield, and, bless me! he was three months tied up sir.
TheInvisibleMan	49	3786	3780	3829	Henfrey	So still, it got on [MASK] s nerves. He felt alone in the room and looked up, and there, grey and dim, was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly, with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them.
TheInvisibleMan	57	3835	3790	3847	Henfrey	He felt alone in the room and looked up, and there, grey and dim, was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly, with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them. It was so uncanny to [MASK] that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another.
TheInvisibleMan	46	4223	4189	4235	Henfrey	"Looks a bit like a disguise, don t it? I d like to see a man s face if I had him stopping in _my_ place," said [MASK]. "But women are that trustful where strangers are concerned.
TheInvisibleMan	43	4277	4272	4315	Teddy	"Yes," said [MASK]. "By the week. Whatever he is, you can t get rid of him under the week. And he s got a lot of luggage coming to-morrow, so he says.
TheInvisibleMan	50	4327	4279	4329	Hall	"By the week. Whatever he is, you can t get rid of him under the week. And he s got a lot of luggage coming to-morrow, so he says. Let s hope it won t be stones in boxes, [MASK]."
TheInvisibleMan	43	4923	4920	4963	Fearenside	No sooner had [MASK] s dog caught sight of him, however, than it began to bristle and growl savagely, and when he rushed down the steps it gave an undecided hop, and then sprang straight at his hand. "
TheInvisibleMan	46	5039	5034	5080	Fearenside	Then the finer end of [MASK] s whip reached his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay, retreated under the wheels of the waggon. It was all the business of a swift half-minute. No one spoke, everyone shouted.
TheInvisibleMan	46	5141	5116	5162	Fearenside	They heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom. "You brute, you!" said [MASK], climbing off the waggon with his whip in his hand, while the dog watched him through the wheel.
TheInvisibleMan	49	6485	6485	6534	Fearing	[MASK] "something was the matter," she went to the door and listened, not caring to knock. "I can t go on," he was raving. "I _can t_ go on. Three hundred thousand, four hundred thousand!
TheInvisibleMan	50	6721	6674	6724	Fearenside	"For God s sake don t worry me. If there s damage done, put it down in the bill," and he went on ticking a list in the exercise book before him. "I ll tell you something," said [MASK], mysteriously.
TheInvisibleMan	52	6835	6792	6844	Henfrey	You d have expected a sort of pinky to show, wouldn t you? Well there wasn t none. Just blackness. I tell you, he s as black as my hat." "My sakes!" said [MASK]. "It s a rummy case altogether.
TheInvisibleMan	41	6863	6837	6878	Fearenside	"It s a rummy case altogether. Why, his nose is as pink as paint!" "That s true," said [MASK]. "I knows that. And I tell ee what I m thinking.
TheInvisibleMan	50	6885	6879	6929	Teddy	That marn s a piebald, [MASK]. Black here and white there in patches. And he s ashamed of it. He s a kind of half-breed, and the colour s come off patchy instead of mixing. I ve heard of such things before.
TheInvisibleMan	41	7061	7061	7102	Hall	[MASK] did not like him, and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability of getting rid of him; but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing it ostentatiously, and avoiding his visitor as much as possible. "
TheInvisibleMan	49	7905	7869	7918	April	That had the advantage of accounting for everything straight away. Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers. Sussex folk have few superstitions, and it was only after the events of early [MASK] that the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the village.
TheInvisibleMan	50	8503	8464	8514	Cuss	Then she heard the stranger laughing quietly, and then his footsteps came across the room. She could not see his face where she stood. The parlour door slammed, and the place was silent again. [MASK] went straight up the village to Bunting the vicar. "
TheInvisibleMan	50	8520	8515	8565	Cuss	Am I mad?" [MASK] began abruptly, as he entered the shabby little study. "Do I look like an insane person?" "What s happened?" said the vicar, putting the ammonite on the loose sheets of his forth-coming sermon.
TheInvisibleMan	52	9486	9446	9498	Cuss	"It s all very well for you to laugh, but I tell you I was so startled, I hit his cuff hard, and turned around, and cut out of the room I left him " [MASK] stopped. There was no mistaking the sincerity of his panic.
TheInvisibleMan	51	9529	9499	9550	Cuss	He turned round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the excellent vicar s very inferior sherry. "When I hit his cuff," said [MASK], "I tell you, it felt exactly like hitting an arm. And there wasn t an arm!
TheInvisibleMan	51	10475	10458	10509	Daylight	There was not a soul to be found in the house, search as they would. [MASK] found the vicar and his wife, a quaintly-costumed little couple, still marvelling about on their own ground floor by the unnecessary light of a guttering candle. CHAPTER VI.
TheInvisibleMan	53	10840	10839	10892	Hall	As [MASK] stood there he heard his wife s voice coming out of the depth of the cellar, with that rapid telescoping of the syllables and interrogative cocking up of the final words to a high note, by which the West Sussex villager is wont to indicate a brisk impatience.
TheInvisibleMan	50	10978	10978	11028	Hall	[MASK], still holding the bottle, went first. "If e en t there," he said, " is close are. And what s e doin ithout is close, then? Tas a most curious business." As they came up the cellar steps
TheInvisibleMan	49	11157	11117	11166	Hall	She flung open the door and stood regarding the room. "Of all the curious!" she said. She heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed, and turning, was surprised to see [MASK] a dozen feet off on the topmost stair.
TheInvisibleMan	49	11786	11752	11801	Huxter	They wanted him to lead the way upstairs to the room, but he didn t seem to be in any hurry. He preferred to talk in the passage. Over the way [MASK] s apprentice came out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window.
TheInvisibleMan	48	12735	12735	12783	Hall	[MASK] was still out. She had deliberated over this scene, and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it. "Is it your bill you re wanting, sir?" she said. "Why wasn t my breakfast laid?
TheInvisibleMan	44	14264	14261	14305	Jaffers	In another moment [MASK], cutting short some statement concerning a warrant, had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat. He got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout, but he kept his grip.
TheInvisibleMan	46	14492	14479	14525	Jaffers	"I ll surrender," cried the stranger, though he had [MASK] down, and in another moment he stood up panting, a strange figure, headless and handless for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left.
TheInvisibleMan	48	14580	14542	14590	Jaffers	It was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if out of empty space, but the Sussex peasants are perhaps the most matter-of-fact people under the sun. [MASK] got up also and produced a pair of handcuffs.
TheInvisibleMan	49	14686	14670	14719	Huxter	He seemed to be fumbling with his shoes and socks. "Why!" said [MASK], suddenly, "that s not a man at all. It s just empty clothes. Look! You can see down his collar and the linings of his clothes.
TheInvisibleMan	49	14886	14880	14929	Huxter	Invisible, eh?" said [MASK], ignoring the stranger s abuse. "Who ever heard the likes of that?" "It s strange, perhaps, but it s not a crime. Why am I assaulted by a policeman in this fashion?"
TheInvisibleMan	50	14941	14930	14980	Jaffers	"Ah! that s a different matter," said [MASK]. "No doubt you are a bit difficult to see in this light, but I got a warrant and it s all correct. What I m after ain t no invisibility, it s burglary.
TheInvisibleMan	49	15062	15014	15063	Jaffers	"I hope so, sir; but I ve got my instructions." "Well," said the stranger, "I ll come. I ll _come_. But no handcuffs." "It s the regular thing," said [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	46	15172	15166	15212	Jaffers	"Hold him!" said [MASK], loudly. "Once he gets the things off " "Hold him!" cried everyone, and there was a rush at the fluttering white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger.
TheInvisibleMan	53	15511	15479	15532	Jaffers	He felt a muscular chest, and in another moment the whole mass of struggling, excited men shot out into the crowded hall. "I got him!" shouted [MASK], choking and reeling through them all, and wrestling with purple face and swelling veins against his unseen enemy.
TheInvisibleMan	51	15562	15562	15613	Jaffers	[MASK] cried in a strangled voice holding tight, nevertheless, and making play with his knee spun around, and fell heavily undermost with his head on the gravel. Only then did his fingers relax. There were excited cries of "Hold him!" "Invisible!"
TheInvisibleMan	49	15728	15699	15748	Jaffers	For a space people stood amazed and gesticulating, and then came panic, and scattered them abroad through the village as a gust scatters dead leaves. But [MASK] lay quite still, face upward and knees bent, at the foot of the steps of the inn.
TheInvisibleMan	47	15888	15888	15935	Gibbons	[MASK] had heard nothing of the morning s occurrences, but the phenomenon was so striking and disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity vanished; he got up hastily, and hurried down the steepness of the hill towards the village, as fast as he could go.
TheInvisibleMan	53	16484	16484	16537	Lord	[MASK]! But them boots! It beats it." He turned his head over his shoulder to the right, to look at the boots of his interlocutor with a view to comparisons, and lo! where the boots of his interlocutor should have been were neither legs nor boots.
TheInvisibleMan	49	17720	17680	17729	Marvel	But I m invisible. You see? Invisible. Simple idea. Invisible." "What, real like?" "Yes, real." "Let s have a hand of you," said [MASK], "if you _are_ real.
TheInvisibleMan	49	17802	17767	17816	Marvel	He felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged fingers, and his fingers went timorously up the arm, patted a muscular chest, and explored a bearded face. [MASK] s face was astonishment. "I m dashed!" he said.
TheInvisibleMan	51	18263	18214	18265	Lord	And you ve pretty near broken my toe. It s all so unreasonable. Empty downs, empty sky. Nothing visible for miles except the bosom of Nature. And then comes a voice. A voice out of heaven! And stones! And a fist [MASK]!"
TheInvisibleMan	49	18477	18444	18493	Lord	"Don t you go a-thinking that, whatever you do. All I want to do is to help you just tell me what I got to do. ([MASK]!) Whatever you want done, that I m most willing to do."
TheInvisibleMan	50	19854	19839	19889	Cuss	The Vicar stood with his hands on the table. "Diary," repeated [MASK], sitting down, putting two volumes to support the third, and opening it. "H m no name on the fly-leaf. Bother! cypher. And figures."
TheInvisibleMan	45	19900	19871	19916	Cuss	"H m no name on the fly-leaf. Bother! cypher. And figures." The vicar came round to look over his shoulder. [MASK] turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed. "I m dear me!
TheInvisibleMan	50	20072	20066	20116	Cuss	"A general impression first, [MASK], and _then_, you know, we can go looking for clues." He coughed, put on his glasses, arranged them fastidiously, coughed again, and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure.
TheInvisibleMan	50	20122	20090	20140	Cuss	He coughed, put on his glasses, arranged them fastidiously, coughed again, and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure. Then he took the volume [MASK] handed him in a leisurely manner. And then something did happen. The door opened suddenly.
TheInvisibleMan	49	20165	20136	20185	Tap	The door opened suddenly. Both gentlemen started violently, looked round, and were relieved to see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat. "[MASK]?" asked the face, and stood staring. "No," said both gentlemen at once.
TheInvisibleMan	48	20317	20280	20328	Cuss	"Amusing fellows, they are. Stand clear! indeed. A nautical term, referring to his getting back out of the room, I suppose." "I daresay so," said [MASK]. "My nerves are all loose to-day.
TheInvisibleMan	45	20432	20413	20458	Cuss	I cannot of course believe in this absurd invisibility story " "It s incredible," said [MASK] "incredible. But the fact remains that I saw I certainly saw right down his sleeve " "But did you are you sure?
TheInvisibleMan	59	20494	20436	20495	Cuss	But the fact remains that I saw I certainly saw right down his sleeve " "But did you are you sure? Suppose a mirror, for instance hallucinations are so easily produced. I don t know if you have ever seen a really good conjuror " "I won t argue again," said [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	42	20503	20496	20538	Bunting	"We ve thrashed that out, [MASK]. And just now there s these books Ah! here s some of what I take to be Greek! Greek letters certainly." He pointed to the middle of the page.
TheInvisibleMan	46	20639	20611	20657	Cuss	"Don t move, little men," whispered a voice, "or I ll brain you both!" He looked into the face of [MASK], close to his own, and each saw a horrified reflection of his own sickly astonishment.
TheInvisibleMan	47	21256	21248	21295	Hall	"You all right thur?" asked [MASK], rapping. The muttered conversation ceased abruptly, for a moment silence, then the conversation was resumed, in hissing whispers, then a sharp cry of "No! no, you don t!"
TheInvisibleMan	42	21842	21837	21879	Huxter	"Yap!" cried [MASK]. "Stop thief!" and he ran obliquely across the oblong towards the yard gates, and vanished. Simultaneously came a tumult from the parlour, and a sound of windows being closed.
TheInvisibleMan	46	22018	22017	22063	Hall	But [MASK] had hardly run a dozen yards before he gave a loud shout of astonishment and went flying headlong sideways, clutching one of the labourers and bringing him to the ground. He had been charged just as one charges a man at football.
TheInvisibleMan	41	22333	22308	22349	Marvel	"Hold him!" he cried. "Don t let him drop that parcel." He knew nothing of the existence of [MASK]. For the Invisible Man had handed over the books and bundle in the yard.
TheInvisibleMan	51	22418	22396	22447	Henfrey	And every stitch of the Vicar s clothes!" " Tend to him in a minute!" he cried to [MASK] as he passed the prostrate Huxter, and, coming round the corner to join the tumult, was promptly knocked off his feet into an indecorous sprawl.
TheInvisibleMan	51	22687	22658	22709	Cuss	West Surrey Gazette_. "Who s coming?" he said, so startled that his costume narrowly escaped disintegration. "Invisible Man," said [MASK], and rushed on to the window. "We d better clear out from here! He s fighting mad!
TheInvisibleMan	54	23331	23318	23372	Marvel	"I didn t try to give you the slip," said [MASK], in a voice that was not far remote from tears. "I swear I didn t. I didn t know the blessed turning, that was all! How the devil was I to know the blessed turning?
TheInvisibleMan	50	23496	23465	23515	Marvel	Here am I ... No one knew I was invisible! And now what am I to do?" "What am _I_ to do?" asked [MASK], _sotto voce_. "It s all about. It will be in the papers!
TheInvisibleMan	50	23658	23645	23695	Marvel	"I m the worst possible tool you could have," said [MASK]. "I m not strong," he said after a discouraging silence. "I m not over strong," he repeated. "No?" "And my heart s weak.
TheInvisibleMan	51	23800	23765	23816	Marvel	But I might out of sheer funk and misery." "You d better not," said the Voice, with quiet emphasis. "I wish I was dead," said [MASK]. "It ain t justice," he said; "you must admit....
TheInvisibleMan	52	25129	25085	25137	Marvel	Extra-ordinary, _I_ call it. Never heard tell of Invisible Men before, I haven t, but nowadays one hears such a lot of extra-ordinary things that " "That all he did?" asked [MASK], trying to seem at his ease.
TheInvisibleMan	54	25163	25138	25192	Marvel	"It s enough, ain t it?" said the mariner. "Didn t go Back by any chance?" asked [MASK]. "Just escaped and that s all, eh?" "All!" said the mariner. "Why! ain t it enough?"
TheInvisibleMan	48	25199	25165	25213	Marvel	"Just escaped and that s all, eh?" "All!" said the mariner. "Why! ain t it enough?" "Quite enough," said [MASK]. "I should think it was enough," said the mariner.
TheInvisibleMan	54	25269	25249	25303	Heaven	"Ain t one of a sort enough for you?" asked the mariner. "No, thank [MASK], as one might say, he didn t." He nodded his head slowly. "It makes me regular uncomfortable, the bare thought of that chap running about the country!
TheInvisibleMan	49	25824	25803	25852	Marvel	"But it s in the paper," said the mariner. "Hoax all the same," said [MASK]. "I know the chap that started the lie. There ain t no Invisible Man whatsoever Blimey." "But how bout this paper?
TheInvisibleMan	46	25869	25826	25872	Marvel	"I know the chap that started the lie. There ain t no Invisible Man whatsoever Blimey." "But how bout this paper? D you mean to say ?" "Not a word of it," said [MASK], stoutly.
TheInvisibleMan	44	27258	27232	27276	Fear	They were bolting into houses and slamming the doors behind them, with the news. He heard it and made one last desperate spurt. [MASK] came striding by, rushed ahead of him, and in a moment had seized the town.
TheInvisibleMan	45	27353	27319	27364	Burton	The barman leant his fat red arms on the counter and talked of horses with an anaemic cabman, while a black-bearded man in grey snapped up biscuit and cheese, drank [MASK], and conversed in American with a policeman off duty.
TheInvisibleMan	46	27432	27418	27464	Marvel	Footsteps approached, running heavily, the door was pushed open violently, and [MASK], weeping and dishevelled, his hat gone, the neck of his coat torn open, rushed in, made a convulsive turn, and attempted to shut the door.
TheInvisibleMan	46	28188	28143	28189	Marvel	Five minutes afterwards when a second cabman pushed his head in cautiously, they were still waiting, and an anxious face peered out of the bar-parlour and supplied information. "Are all the doors of the house shut?" asked [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	50	28495	28462	28512	Marvel	The bearded man s revolver cracked and the looking-glass at the back of the parlour starred and came smashing and tinkling down. As the barman entered the room he saw [MASK], curiously crumpled up and struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen.
TheInvisibleMan	53	28612	28607	28660	Marvel	The door opened, and [MASK] made a frantic effort to obtain a lodgment behind it. Then the cabman collared something. "I got him," said the cabman. The barman s red hands came clawing at the unseen. "Here he is!" said the barman.
TheInvisibleMan	54	29092	29092	29146	Thence	[MASK] his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships lights shone, and the pier glowed a little illuminated, facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light. The moon in its first quarter hung over the westward hill, and the stars were clear and almost tropically bright.
TheInvisibleMan	51	30003	29985	30036	Kemp	"Keep your nerve," said the Voice. "I m an Invisible Man." [MASK] made no answer for a space, simply stared at the bandage. "Invisible Man," he said. "I am an Invisible Man," repeated the Voice.
TheInvisibleMan	51	30050	30025	30076	Kemp	"I am an Invisible Man," repeated the Voice. The story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed through [MASK] s brain. He does not appear to have been either very much frightened or very greatly surprised at the moment. Realisation came later.
TheInvisibleMan	49	30129	30124	30173	Kemp	"Oh!" said [MASK], and then roused himself. "I say!" he said. "But this is nonsense. It s some trick." He stepped forward suddenly, and his hand, extended towards the bandage, met invisible fingers.
TheInvisibleMan	50	30188	30144	30194	Kemp	"But this is nonsense. It s some trick." He stepped forward suddenly, and his hand, extended towards the bandage, met invisible fingers. He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed. "Keep steady, [MASK], for God s sake!
TheInvisibleMan	56	30243	30229	30285	Kemp	and the grip tightened. A frantic desire to free himself took possession of [MASK]. The hand of the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder, and he was suddenly tripped and flung backwards upon the bed. He opened his mouth to shout, and the corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth.
TheInvisibleMan	49	30449	30401	30450	Kemp	It s no foolishness, and no magic. I really am an Invisible Man. And I want your help. I don t want to hurt you, but if you behave like a frantic rustic, I must. Don t you remember me, [MASK]?
TheInvisibleMan	48	30497	30476	30524	Griffin	And let me sit quiet for a minute." He sat up and felt his neck. "I am [MASK], of University College, and I have made myself invisible. I am just an ordinary man a man you have known made invisible."
TheInvisibleMan	43	30533	30532	30575	Griffin	"[MASK]," answered the Voice. A younger student than you were, almost an albino, six feet high, and broad, with a pink and white face and red eyes, who won the medal for chemistry."
TheInvisibleMan	50	30583	30540	30590	Kemp	A younger student than you were, almost an albino, six feet high, and broad, with a pink and white face and red eyes, who won the medal for chemistry." "I am confused," said [MASK]. "My brain is rioting.
TheInvisibleMan	49	30656	30620	30669	Kemp	"But what devilry must happen to make a man invisible?" "It s no devilry. It s a process, sane and intelligible enough " "It s horrible!" said [MASK]. "How on earth ?" "It s horrible enough.
TheInvisibleMan	47	30710	30691	30738	Kemp	Take it steady. Give me some food and drink, and let me sit down here." [MASK] stared at the bandage as it moved across the room, then saw a basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed.
TheInvisibleMan	50	30798	30766	30816	Kemp	This beats ghosts," he said, and laughed stupidly. "That s better. Thank Heaven, you re getting sensible!" "Or silly," said [MASK], and knuckled his eyes. "Give me some whiskey. I m near dead."
TheInvisibleMan	52	30862	30858	30910	Kemp	The chair creaked and [MASK] felt the glass drawn away from him. He let go by an effort; his instinct was all against it. It came to rest poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the chair. He stared at it in infinite perplexity.
TheInvisibleMan	50	30956	30941	30991	Kemp	"Listen to me." "I demonstrated conclusively this morning," began [MASK], "that invisibility " "Never mind what you ve demonstrated! I m starving," said the Voice, "and the night is chilly to a man without clothes."
TheInvisibleMan	47	30997	30970	31017	Kemp	I m starving," said the Voice, "and the night is chilly to a man without clothes." "Food?" said [MASK]. The tumbler of whiskey tilted itself. "Yes," said the Invisible Man rapping it down.
TheInvisibleMan	49	31027	31006	31055	Kemp	"Yes," said the Invisible Man rapping it down. "Have you a dressing-gown?" [MASK] made some exclamation in an undertone. He walked to a wardrobe and produced a robe of dingy scarlet. "This do?" he asked.
TheInvisibleMan	46	31203	31198	31244	Kemp	"Invisible!" said [MASK], and sat down on a bedroom chair. "I always like to get something about me before I eat," said the Invisible Man, with a full mouth, eating greedily. "Queer fancy!"
TheInvisibleMan	50	31256	31245	31295	Kemp	"I suppose that wrist is all right," said [MASK]. "Trust me," said the Invisible Man. "Of all the strange and wonderful " "Exactly. But it s odd I should blunder into _your_ house to get my bandaging.
TheInvisibleMan	50	31387	31348	31398	Kemp	It s only the living tissue I ve changed, and only for as long as I m alive.... I ve been in the house three hours." "But how s it done?" began [MASK], in a tone of exasperation. "Confound it!
TheInvisibleMan	50	31435	31435	31485	Kemp	[MASK] stared at the devouring dressing gown. A ray of candle-light penetrating a torn patch in the right shoulder, made a triangle of light under the left ribs. "What were the shots?" he asked. "How did the shooting begin?"
TheInvisibleMan	51	31566	31566	31617	Kemp	[MASK] got up. "_You_ didn t do any shooting?" he asked. "Not me," said his visitor. "Some fool I d never seen fired at random. A lot of them got scared. They all got scared at me.
TheInvisibleMan	49	31631	31584	31633	Kemp	"Not me," said his visitor. "Some fool I d never seen fired at random. A lot of them got scared. They all got scared at me. Curse them! I say I want more to eat than this, [MASK]."
TheInvisibleMan	43	31647	31634	31677	Kemp	"I ll see what there is to eat downstairs," said [MASK]. "Not much, I m afraid." After he had done eating, and he made a heavy meal, the Invisible Man demanded a cigar.
TheInvisibleMan	48	31684	31649	31697	Kemp	"Not much, I m afraid." After he had done eating, and he made a heavy meal, the Invisible Man demanded a cigar. He bit the end savagely before [MASK] could find a knife, and cursed when the outer leaf loosened.
TheInvisibleMan	51	31751	31734	31785	Kemp	he said, and puffed vigorously. "I m lucky to have fallen upon you, [MASK]. You must help me. Fancy tumbling on you just now! I m in a devilish scrape I ve been mad, I think. The things I have been through!
TheInvisibleMan	49	31807	31786	31835	Kemp	But we will do things yet. Let me tell you " He helped himself to more whiskey and soda. [MASK] got up, looked about him, and fetched a glass from his spare room. "It s wild but I suppose I may drink."
TheInvisibleMan	48	31843	31824	31872	Kemp	"It s wild but I suppose I may drink." "You haven t changed much, [MASK], these dozen years. You fair men don t. Cool and methodical after the first collapse. I must tell you. We will work together!"
TheInvisibleMan	48	31883	31862	31910	Kemp	I must tell you. We will work together!" "But how was it all done?" said [MASK], "and how did you get like this?" "For God s sake, let me smoke in peace for a little while!
TheInvisibleMan	45	32057	32015	32060	Kemp	"He meant to give me the slip he was always casting about! What a fool I was! "The cur! "I should have killed him!" "Where did you get the money?" asked [MASK], abruptly.
TheInvisibleMan	57	32100	32070	32127	Kemp	"I can t tell you to-night," he said. He groaned suddenly and leant forward, supporting his invisible head on invisible hands. "[MASK]," he said, "I ve had no sleep for near three days, except a couple of dozes of an hour or so.
TheInvisibleMan	52	32177	32128	32180	Kemp	I must sleep soon." "Well, have my room have this room." "But how can I sleep? If I sleep he will get away. Ugh! What does it matter?" "What s the shot wound?" asked [MASK], abruptly.
TheInvisibleMan	50	32313	32293	32343	Kemp	He examined the two windows of the bedroom, drew up the blinds and opened the sashes, to confirm [MASK] s statement that a retreat by them would be possible. Outside the night was very quiet and still, and the new moon was setting over the down.
TheInvisibleMan	50	32387	32344	32394	Kemp	Then he examined the keys of the bedroom and the two dressing-room doors, to satisfy himself that these also could be made an assurance of freedom. Finally he expressed himself satisfied. He stood on the hearth rug and [MASK] heard the sound of a yawn.
TheInvisibleMan	51	32443	32435	32486	Kemp	It s horrible! But believe me, [MASK], in spite of your arguments of this morning, it is quite a possible thing. I have made a discovery. I meant to keep it to myself. I can t. I must have a partner. And you....
TheInvisibleMan	51	32500	32461	32512	Kemp	I have made a discovery. I meant to keep it to myself. I can t. I must have a partner. And you.... We can do such things ... But to-morrow. Now, [MASK], I feel as though I must sleep or perish."
TheInvisibleMan	50	32513	32513	32563	Kemp	[MASK] stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment. "I suppose I must leave you," he said. "It s incredible. Three things happening like this, overturning all my preconceptions would make me insane. But it s real!
TheInvisibleMan	47	32585	32539	32586	Griffin	"It s incredible. Three things happening like this, overturning all my preconceptions would make me insane. But it s real! Is there anything more that I can get you?" "Only bid me good-night," said [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	53	32594	32587	32640	Kemp	"Good-night," said [MASK], and shook an invisible hand. He walked sideways to the door. Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly towards him. "Understand me!" said the dressing-gown. "No attempts to hamper me, or capture me!
TheInvisibleMan	47	32643	32602	32649	Kemp	He walked sideways to the door. Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly towards him. "Understand me!" said the dressing-gown. "No attempts to hamper me, or capture me! Or " [MASK] s face changed a little.
TheInvisibleMan	49	32663	32663	32712	Kemp	[MASK] closed the door softly behind him, and the key was turned upon him forthwith. Then, as he stood with an expression of passive amazement on his face, the rapid feet came to the door of the dressing-room and that too was locked.
TheInvisibleMan	51	32713	32713	32764	Kemp	[MASK] slapped his brow with his hand. "Am I dreaming? Has the world gone mad or have I?" He laughed, and put his hand to the locked door. "Barred out of my own bedroom, by a flagrant absurdity!" he said.
TheInvisibleMan	49	33223	33217	33266	Kemp	"Good Heavens!" said [MASK], reading eagerly an incredulous account of the events in Iping, of the previous afternoon, that have already been described. Over the leaf the report in the morning paper had been reprinted. He re-read it. "
TheInvisibleMan	52	33666	33666	33718	Kemp	[MASK] read every scrap of the report and sent his housemaid out to get every one of the morning papers she could. These also he devoured. "He is invisible!" he said. "And it reads like rage growing to mania! The things he may do!
TheInvisibleMan	51	34114	34104	34155	Kemp	"Before we can do anything else," said [MASK], "I must understand a little more about this invisibility of yours." He had sat down, after one nervous glance out of the window, with the air of a man who has talking to do.
TheInvisibleMan	42	34175	34156	34198	Griffin	His doubts of the sanity of the entire business flashed and vanished again as he looked across to where [MASK] sat at the breakfast-table a headless, handless dressing-gown, wiping unseen lips on a miraculously held serviette.
TheInvisibleMan	50	34392	34356	34406	Kemp	I will devote my life to this. This is worth while. You know what fools we are at two-and-twenty?" "Fools then or fools now," said [MASK]. "As though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man!"
TheInvisibleMan	51	34612	34578	34629	Griffin	But still I don t see quite ... I can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone, but personal invisibility is a far cry." "Precisely," said [MASK]. "But consider, visibility depends on the action of the visible bodies on light.
TheInvisibleMan	52	34969	34939	34991	Kemp	It is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air. And for precisely the same reason!" "Yes," said [MASK], "that is pretty plain sailing." "And here is another fact you will know to be true.
TheInvisibleMan	49	35000	34979	35028	Kemp	"And here is another fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of glass is smashed, [MASK], and beaten into a powder, it becomes much more visible while it is in the air; it becomes at last an opaque white powder.
TheInvisibleMan	48	35251	35236	35284	Griffin	"But a man s not powdered glass!" "No," said [MASK]. "He s more transparent!" "Nonsense!" "That from a doctor! How one forgets! Have you already forgotten your physics, in ten years?
TheInvisibleMan	49	35483	35459	35508	Kemp	For the most part the fibres of a living creature are no more opaque than water." "Great Heavens!" cried [MASK]. "Of course, of course! I was thinking only last night of the sea larvae and all jelly-fish!"
TheInvisibleMan	51	35553	35536	35587	Oliver	But I kept it to myself. I had to do my work under frightful disadvantages. [MASK], my professor, was a scientific bounder, a journalist by instinct, a thief of ideas he was always prying! And you know the knavish system of the scientific world.
TheInvisibleMan	46	36073	36028	36074	Kemp	was his everlasting question. And the students, the cramped means! Three years I had of it "And after three years of secrecy and exasperation, I found that to complete it was impossible impossible." "How?" asked [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	59	36207	36153	36212	Griffin	Then he started, struck by a thought, rose, took the Invisible Man s arm, and turned him away from the outlook. "You are tired," he said, "and while I sit, you walk about. Have my chair." He placed himself between [MASK] and the nearest window.
TheInvisibleMan	46	38244	38209	38255	Kemp	After a time I crawled home, took some food and a strong dose of strychnine, and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed. Strychnine is a grand tonic, [MASK], to take the flabbiness out of a man."
TheInvisibleMan	49	38264	38256	38305	Kemp	"It s the devil," said [MASK]. "It s the palaeolithic in a bottle." "I awoke vastly invigorated and rather irritable. You know?" "I know the stuff." "And there was someone rapping at the door.
TheInvisibleMan	43	41157	41127	41170	Dogs	"I had never realised it before, but the nose is to the mind of a dog what the eye is to the mind of a seeing man. [MASK] perceive the scent of a man moving as men perceive his vision.
TheInvisibleMan	52	42311	42311	42363	Kemp	[MASK] glanced nervously out of the window. "Yes?" he said. "Go on." CHAPTER XXII. IN THE EMPORIUM "So last January, with the beginning of a snowstorm in the air about me and if it settled on me it would betray me!
TheInvisibleMan	48	44976	44943	44991	Kemp	I was fasting; for to eat, to fill myself with unassimilated matter, would be to become grotesquely visible again." "I never thought of that," said [MASK]. "Nor had I. And the snow had warned me of other dangers.
TheInvisibleMan	49	46901	46892	46941	Kemp	"Knocked him on the head?" exclaimed [MASK]. "Yes stunned him as he was going downstairs. Hit him from behind with a stool that stood on the landing. He went downstairs like a bag of old boots." "But I say!
TheInvisibleMan	50	46962	46942	46992	Kemp	The common conventions of humanity " "Are all very well for common people. But the point was, [MASK], that I had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me. I couldn t think of any other way of doing it.
TheInvisibleMan	52	47061	47030	47082	Kemp	It was rather a good idea to keep the idiot scared and quiet, and a devilish hard thing to get out of head away from the string. My dear [MASK], it s no good your sitting glaring as though I was a murderer. It had to be done.
TheInvisibleMan	53	47149	47116	47169	Kemp	And the man was in his own house, and you were well, robbing." "Robbing! Confound it! You ll call me a thief next! Surely, [MASK], you re not fool enough to dance on the old strings. Can t you see my position?
TheInvisibleMan	50	47196	47187	47237	Kemp	"What do you mean to say?" [MASK] s face grew a trifle hard. He was about to speak and checked himself. "I suppose, after all," he said with a sudden change of manner, "the thing had to be done.
TheInvisibleMan	50	47311	47282	47332	Kemp	He was simply exasperating. You don t blame me, do you? You don t blame me?" "I never blame anyone," said [MASK]. "It s quite out of fashion. What did you do next?" "I was hungry.
TheInvisibleMan	49	47951	47939	47988	Kemp	"And you troubled no more about the hunchback?" said [MASK]. "No," said the Invisible Man. "Nor have I heard what became of him. I suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out. The knots were pretty tight."
TheInvisibleMan	51	48444	48413	48464	Delilah	Ambition what is the good of pride of place when you cannot appear there? What is the good of the love of woman when her name must needs be [MASK]? I have no taste for politics, for the blackguardisms of fame, for philanthropy, for sport.
TheInvisibleMan	55	48696	48666	48721	Kemp	I remember the snowstorm now, and the accursed bother it was to keep the snow from damping my pasteboard nose." "At the end," said [MASK], "the day before yesterday, when they found you out, you rather to judge by the papers " "I did.
TheInvisibleMan	51	48739	48722	48773	Kemp	Rather. Did I kill that fool of a constable?" "No," said [MASK]. "He s expected to recover." "That s his luck, then. I clean lost my temper, the fools! Why couldn t they leave me alone?
TheInvisibleMan	49	48789	48741	48790	Kemp	"He s expected to recover." "That s his luck, then. I clean lost my temper, the fools! Why couldn t they leave me alone? And that grocer lout?" "There are no deaths expected," said [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	42	48817	48813	48855	Kemp	"By Heaven, [MASK], you don t know what rage _is_! ... To have worked for years, to have planned and plotted, and then to get some fumbling purblind idiot messing across your course! ...
TheInvisibleMan	50	48918	48874	48924	Kemp	"If I have much more of it, I shall go wild I shall start mowing em. "As it is, they ve made things a thousand times more difficult." "No doubt it s exasperating," said [MASK], drily. CHAPTER XXIV.
TheInvisibleMan	42	48995	48954	48996	Kemp	He moved nearer his guest as he spoke in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of a sudden glimpse of the three men who were advancing up the hill road with an intolerable slowness, as it seemed to [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	49	49204	49183	49232	Kemp	"And then the filthy brute must needs try and rob me! He _has_ hidden my books, [MASK]. Hidden my books! If I can lay my hands on him!" "Best plan to get the books out of him first."
TheInvisibleMan	49	49308	49279	49328	Kemp	"But that hangs up your plans a little." "We must get those books; those books are vital." "Certainly," said [MASK], a little nervously, wondering if he heard footsteps outside. "Certainly we must get those books.
TheInvisibleMan	53	49459	49408	49461	Kemp	In spite of all that has happened, in spite of this publicity, of the loss of my books, of what I have suffered, there still remain great possibilities, huge possibilities " "You have told no one I am here?" he asked abruptly. [MASK] hesitated.
TheInvisibleMan	55	49513	49507	49562	Kemp	"I made a mistake, [MASK], a huge mistake, in carrying this thing through alone. I have wasted strength, time, opportunities. Alone it is wonderful how little a man can do alone! To rob a little, to hurt a little, and there is the end.
TheInvisibleMan	54	49569	49547	49601	Kemp	To rob a little, to hurt a little, and there is the end." "What I want, [MASK], is a goal-keeper, a helper, and a hiding-place, an arrangement whereby I can sleep and eat and rest in peace, and unsuspected.
TheInvisibleMan	49	49766	49724	49773	Kemp	It s particularly useful, therefore, in killing. I can walk round a man, whatever weapon he has, choose my point, strike as I like. Dodge as I like. Escape as I like." [MASK] s hand went to his moustache.
TheInvisibleMan	55	49812	49804	49859	Griffin	"I m listening to your plan, [MASK], but I m not agreeing, mind. _Why_ killing?" "Not wanton killing, but a judicious slaying. The point is, they know there is an Invisible Man as well as we know there is an Invisible Man.
TheInvisibleMan	49	49865	49838	49887	Kemp	The point is, they know there is an Invisible Man as well as we know there is an Invisible Man. And that Invisible Man, [MASK], must now establish a Reign of Terror. Yes; no doubt it s startling. But I mean it.
TheInvisibleMan	54	49900	49875	49929	Burdock	Yes; no doubt it s startling. But I mean it. A Reign of Terror. He must take some town like your [MASK] and terrify and dominate it. He must issue his orders. He can do that in a thousand ways scraps of paper thrust under doors would suffice.
TheInvisibleMan	49	50058	50050	50099	Griffin	"I don t agree to this, [MASK]," he said. "Understand me, I don t agree to this. Why dream of playing a game against the race? How can you hope to gain happiness? Don t be a lone wolf.
TheInvisibleMan	59	50345	50345	50404	Kemp	[MASK] s face became white. He tried to grip the door handle with both hands. For a moment he stood lugging. Then the door gave six inches. But he got it closed again. The second time it was jerked a foot wide, and the dressing-gown came wedging itself into the opening.
TheInvisibleMan	49	50742	50735	50784	Kemp	"He is mad," said [MASK]; "inhuman. He is pure selfishness. He thinks of nothing but his own advantage, his own safety. I have listened to such a story this morning of brutal self-seeking.... He has wounded men.
TheInvisibleMan	49	50822	50780	50829	Adye	He has wounded men. He will kill them unless we can prevent him. He will create a panic. Nothing can stop him. He is going out now furious!" "He must be caught," said [MASK]. "That is certain."
TheInvisibleMan	44	50836	50824	50868	Kemp	"That is certain." "But how?" cried [MASK], and suddenly became full of ideas. "You must begin at once. You must set every available man to work; you must prevent his leaving this district.
TheInvisibleMan	50	50965	50917	50967	Marvel	The garrison must help. You must wire for help. The only thing that may keep him here is the thought of recovering some books of notes he counts of value. I will tell you of that! There is a man in your police station [MASK]."
TheInvisibleMan	55	50974	50968	51023	Adye	"I know," said [MASK], "I know. Those books yes. But the tramp...." "Says he hasn t them. But he thinks the tramp has. And you must prevent him from eating or sleeping; day and night the country must be astir for him.
TheInvisibleMan	51	51056	51024	51075	Heaven	Food must be locked up and secured, all food, so that he will have to break his way to it. The houses everywhere must be barred against him. [MASK] send us cold nights and rain! The whole country-side must begin hunting and keep hunting.
TheInvisibleMan	45	51080	51064	51109	Adye	The whole country-side must begin hunting and keep hunting. I tell you, [MASK], he is a danger, a disaster; unless he is pinned and secured, it is frightful to think of the things that may happen."
TheInvisibleMan	41	51155	51121	51162	Hopps	"I must go down at once and begin organising. But why not come? Yes you come too! Come, and we must hold a sort of council of war get [MASK] to help and the railway managers.
TheInvisibleMan	51	51195	51178	51229	Adye	What else is there we can do? Put that stuff down." In another moment [MASK] was leading the way downstairs. They found the front door open and the policemen standing outside staring at empty air. "He s got away, sir," said one.
TheInvisibleMan	44	51243	51219	51263	Adye	He s got away, sir," said one. "We must go to the central station at once," said [MASK]. "One of you go on down and get a cab to come up and meet us quickly.
TheInvisibleMan	52	51423	51372	51424	Adye	Every thicket, every quiet corner. And put all weapons all implements that might be weapons, away. He can t carry such things for long. And what he can snatch up and strike men with must be hidden away." "Good again," said [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	45	51478	51461	51506	Adye	"It s cruel, I know. But think of what he may do!" [MASK] drew the air in sharply between his teeth. "It s unsportsmanlike. I don t know. But I ll have powdered glass got ready.
TheInvisibleMan	55	51527	51507	51562	Kemp	If he goes too far...." "The man s become inhuman, I tell you," said [MASK]. "I am as sure he will establish a reign of terror so soon as he has got over the emotions of this escape as I am sure I am talking to you.
TheInvisibleMan	46	51778	51770	51816	Kemp	No doubt he was almost ecstatically exasperated by [MASK] s treachery, and though we may be able to understand the motives that led to that deceit, we may still imagine and even sympathise a little with the fury the attempted surprise must have occasioned.
TheInvisibleMan	48	52747	52719	52767	Griffin	Now this, to the present writer s mind at least, lifts the murder out of the realm of the absolutely wanton. We may imagine that [MASK] had taken the rod as a weapon indeed, but without any deliberate intention of using it in murder.
TheInvisibleMan	43	53157	53120	53163	Kemp	It must have been queer hearing. It drove up across the middle of a clover field and died away towards the hills. That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of the rapid use [MASK] had made of his confidences.
TheInvisibleMan	51	53571	53521	53572	Kemp	This is day one of year one of the new epoch the Epoch of the Invisible Man. I am Invisible Man the First. To begin with the rule will be easy. The first day there will be one execution for the sake of example a man named [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	56	53675	53675	53731	Kemp	[MASK] read this letter twice, "It s no hoax," he said. "That s his voice! And he means it." He turned the folded sheet over and saw on the addressed side of it the postmark Hintondean, and the prosaic detail "2d. to pay."
TheInvisibleMan	51	53980	53980	54031	Griffin	[MASK] _contra mundum_ ... with a vengeance." He stood at the window staring at the hot hillside. "He must get food every day and I don t envy him. Did he really sleep last night? Out in the open somewhere secure from collisions.
TheInvisibleMan	57	54160	54104	54161	Adye	"It must have been a sparrow," he said. Presently he heard the front-door bell ringing, and hurried downstairs. He unbolted and unlocked the door, examined the chain, put it up, and opened cautiously without showing himself. A familiar voice hailed him. It was [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	48	54234	54223	54271	Kemp	He stood in the hall, looking with infinite relief at [MASK] refastening the door. "Note was snatched out of her hand. Scared her horribly. She s down at the station. Hysterics. He s close here. What was it about?"
TheInvisibleMan	48	54505	54493	54541	Kemp	The two men stopped in the doorway, contemplating the wreckage. [MASK] swore again, and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a pistol, hung starred for a moment, and collapsed in jagged, shivering triangles into the room.
TheInvisibleMan	50	54581	54562	54612	Kemp	"There s no way of climbing up here?" "Not for a cat," said [MASK]. "No shutters?" "Not here. All the downstairs rooms Hullo!" Smash, and then whack of boards hit hard came from downstairs. "
TheInvisibleMan	48	54618	54583	54631	Kemp	"No shutters?" "Not here. All the downstairs rooms Hullo!" Smash, and then whack of boards hit hard came from downstairs. "Confound him!" said [MASK]. "That must be yes it s one of the bedrooms.
TheInvisibleMan	48	54688	54641	54689	Adye	But he s a fool. The shutters are up, and the glass will fall outside. He ll cut his feet." Another window proclaimed its destruction. The two men stood on the landing perplexed. "I have it!" said [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	57	54746	54690	54747	Adye	"Let me have a stick or something, and I ll go down to the station and get the bloodhounds put on. That ought to settle him! They re hard by not ten minutes " Another window went the way of its fellows. "You haven t a revolver?" asked [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	46	54837	54815	54861	Kemp	As they stood hesitating in the hall, they heard one of the first-floor bedroom windows crack and clash. [MASK] went to the door and began to slip the bolts as silently as possible. His face was a little paler than usual.
TheInvisibleMan	54	54876	54873	54927	Adye	In another moment [MASK] was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the staples. He hesitated for a moment, feeling more comfortable with his back against the door. Then he marched, upright and square, down the steps. He crossed the lawn and approached the gate.
TheInvisibleMan	45	54954	54919	54964	Adye	He crossed the lawn and approached the gate. A little breeze seemed to ripple over the grass. Something moved near him. "Stop a bit," said a Voice, and [MASK] stopped dead and his hand tightened on the revolver.
TheInvisibleMan	57	55075	55021	55078	Adye	The Voice was on his left front, he thought. Suppose he were to take his luck with a shot? "What are you going for?" said the Voice, and there was a quick movement of the two, and a flash of sunlight from the open lip of [MASK] s pocket.
TheInvisibleMan	49	55177	55129	55178	Adye	He drew clumsily and fired absurdly, and in another moment he was struck in the mouth and the revolver wrested from his grip. He made a vain clutch at a slippery limb, tried to struggle up and fell back. "Damn!" said [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	54	55224	55183	55237	Adye	"I d kill you now if it wasn t the waste of a bullet," it said. He saw the revolver in mid-air, six feet off, covering him. "Well?" said [MASK], sitting up. "Get up," said the Voice.
TheInvisibleMan	55	55238	55229	55284	Adye	"Get up," said the Voice. [MASK] stood up. "Attention," said the Voice, and then fiercely, "Don t try any games. Remember I can see your face if you can t see mine. You ve got to go back to the house."
TheInvisibleMan	47	55295	55261	55308	Adye	Remember I can see your face if you can t see mine. You ve got to go back to the house." "He won t let me in," said [MASK]. "That s a pity," said the Invisible Man.
TheInvisibleMan	48	55581	55572	55620	Adye	"Promise not to rush the door," [MASK] was saying. "Don t push a winning game too far. Give a man a chance." "You go back to the house. I tell you flatly I will not promise anything."
TheInvisibleMan	46	55621	55595	55641	Adye	Give a man a chance." "You go back to the house. I tell you flatly I will not promise anything." [MASK] s decision seemed suddenly made. He turned towards the house, walking slowly with his hands behind him.
TheInvisibleMan	42	55680	55674	55716	Adye	Then things happened very quickly. [MASK] leapt backwards, swung around, clutched at this little object, missed it, threw up his hands and fell forward on his face, leaving a little puff of blue in the air.
TheInvisibleMan	43	55793	55758	55801	Adye	The afternoon was very hot and still, nothing seemed stirring in all the world save a couple of yellow butterflies chasing each other through the shrubbery between the house and the road gate. [MASK] lay on the lawn near the gate.
TheInvisibleMan	51	55835	55802	55853	Kemp	The blinds of all the villas down the hill-road were drawn, but in one little green summer-house was a white figure, apparently an old man asleep. [MASK] scrutinised the surroundings of the house for a glimpse of the revolver, but it had vanished.
TheInvisibleMan	44	55887	55861	55905	Kemp	The game was opening well. Then came a ringing and knocking at the front door, that grew at last tumultuous, but pursuant to [MASK] s instructions the servants had locked themselves into their rooms. This was followed by a silence.
TheInvisibleMan	51	55906	55906	55957	Kemp	[MASK] sat listening and then began peering cautiously out of the three windows, one after another. He went to the staircase head and stood listening uneasily. He armed himself with his bedroom poker, and went to examine the interior fastenings of the ground-floor windows again.
TheInvisibleMan	50	55970	55970	56020	Adye	[MASK] lay motionless over the edge of the gravel just as he had fallen. Coming along the road by the villas were the housemaid and two policemen. Everything was deadly still. The three people seemed very slow in approaching. He wondered what his antagonist was doing.
TheInvisibleMan	44	56219	56179	56223	Griffin	He dodged back. The revolver cracked just too late, and a splinter from the edge of the closing door flashed over his head. He slammed and locked the door, and as he stood outside he heard [MASK] shouting and laughing.
TheInvisibleMan	46	56240	56240	56286	Kemp	[MASK] stood in the passage trying to think. In a moment the Invisible Man would be in the kitchen. This door would not keep him a moment, and then A ringing came at the front door again. It would be the policemen.
TheInvisibleMan	51	56327	56281	56332	Kemp	It would be the policemen. He ran into the hall, put up the chain, and drew the bolts. He made the girl speak before he dropped the chain, and the three people blundered into the house in a heap, and [MASK] slammed the door again.
TheInvisibleMan	44	56356	56342	56386	Adye	"He has a revolver, with two shots left. He s killed [MASK]. Shot him anyhow. Didn t you see him on the lawn? He s lying there." "Who?" said one of the policemen.
TheInvisibleMan	56	56513	56508	56564	Kemp	"Poker," said [MASK], and rushed to the fender. He handed the poker he had carried to the policeman and the dining-room one to the other. He suddenly flung himself backward. "Whup!" said one policeman, ducked, and caught the axe on his poker.
TheInvisibleMan	56	56576	56521	56577	Cooper	He handed the poker he had carried to the policeman and the dining-room one to the other. He suddenly flung himself backward. "Whup!" said one policeman, ducked, and caught the axe on his poker. The pistol snapped its penultimate shot and ripped a valuable Sidney [MASK].
TheInvisibleMan	42	56684	56669	56711	Kemp	Stand away, you two," he said. "I want that man [MASK]." "We want you," said the first policeman, making a quick step forward and wiping with his poker at the Voice.
TheInvisibleMan	49	57204	57178	57227	Kemp	He slept through the smashing of the windows, and then woke up suddenly with a curious persuasion of something wrong. He looked across at [MASK] s house, rubbed his eyes and looked again. Then he put his feet to the ground, and sat listening.
TheInvisibleMan	56	57426	57424	57480	Kemp	He saw [MASK] stand on the sill, spring from the window, and reappear almost instantaneously running along a path in the shrubbery and stooping as he ran, like a man who evades observation. He vanished behind a laburnum, and appeared again clambering over a fence that abutted on the open down.
TheInvisibleMan	47	57644	57612	57659	Kemp	Instantly the house was full of screams and directions, and scurrying feet. He ran himself to shut the French windows that opened on the veranda; as he did so [MASK] s head and shoulders and knee appeared over the edge of the garden fence.
TheInvisibleMan	45	58731	58707	58752	Kemp	He felt a drop of moisture on his face. The grip at his throat suddenly relaxed, and with a convulsive effort, [MASK] loosed himself, grasped a limp shoulder, and rolled uppermost. He gripped the unseen elbows near the ground.
TheInvisibleMan	58	58761	58753	58811	Kemp	"I ve got him!" screamed [MASK]. "Help! Help hold! He s down! Hold his feet!" In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle, and a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an exceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress.
TheInvisibleMan	53	58818	58778	58831	Kemp	In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle, and a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an exceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress. And there was no shouting after [MASK] s cry only a sound of blows and feet and heavy breathing.
TheInvisibleMan	49	58855	58832	58881	Kemp	Then came a mighty effort, and the Invisible Man threw off a couple of his antagonists and rose to his knees. [MASK] clung to him in front like a hound to a stag, and a dozen hands gripped, clutched, and tore at the Unseen.
TheInvisibleMan	51	58954	58928	58979	Kemp	Mercy!" that died down swiftly to a sound like choking. "Get back, you fools!" cried the muffled voice of [MASK], and there was a vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms. "He s hurt, I tell you. Stand back!"
TheInvisibleMan	57	60375	60321	60378	Lord	what a one he was for intellect!" Presently he relaxes and leans back, and blinks through his smoke across the room at things invisible to other eyes. "Full of secrets," he says. "Wonderful secrets!" "Once I get the haul of them _[MASK]_!"
TheInvisibleMan	54	60419	60396	60450	Kemp	He pulls at his pipe. So he lapses into a dream, the undying wonderful dream of his life. And though [MASK] has fished unceasingly, no human being save the landlord knows those books are there, with the subtle secret of invisibility and a dozen other strange secrets written therein.
