TheManWhoWasThursday	51	90	85	136	Whistler	Like the white lock of [MASK], that lit our aimless gloom, Men showed their own white feather as proudly as a plume. Life was a fly that faded, and death a drone that stung; The world was very old indeed when you and I were young.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	1919	1919	1972	Gregory	[MASK] resumed in high oratorical good humour. "An artist is identical with an anarchist," he cried. "You might transpose the words anywhere. An anarchist is an artist. The man who throws a bomb is an artist, because he prefers a great moment to everything.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	2055	2050	2095	Gregory	"Nonsense!" said [MASK], who was very rational when anyone else attempted paradox. "Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired, so very sad and tired? I will tell you.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	2193	2181	2235	Syme	"It is you who are unpoetical," replied the poet [MASK]. "If what you say of clerks is true, they can only be as prosaic as your poetry. The rare, strange thing is to hit the mark; the gross, obvious thing is to miss it.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	2352	2316	2358	Bradshaw	No, take your books of mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of pride. Take your Byron, who commemorates the defeats of man; give me [MASK], who commemorates his victories.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	2470	2434	2479	Victoria	I say that one might do a thousand things instead, and that whenever I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape. And when I hear the guard shout out the word [MASK],' it is not an unmeaning word.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	2600	2586	2633	Syme	The poet is always in revolt." "There again," said [MASK] irritably, "what is there poetical about being in revolt? You might as well say that it is poetical to be sea-sick. Being sick is a revolt.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	2688	2663	2711	Syme	Revolt in the abstract is revolting. It's mere vomiting." The girl winced for a flash at the unpleasant word, but [MASK] was too hot to heed her. "It is things going right," he cried, "that is poetical!
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	2831	2831	2873	Syme	[MASK] looked straight into his eyes and smiled sweetly. "No, I don't," he said; "but I suppose that if you were serious about your anarchism, that is exactly what you would do."
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	2874	2874	2925	Gregory	[MASK]'s big bull's eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angry lion, and one could almost fancy that his red mane rose. "Don't you think, then," he said in a dangerous voice, "that I am serious about my anarchism?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	3237	3223	3273	Syme	she asked. "Only in that sense I speak of," replied [MASK]; "or if you prefer it, in that nonsense." She drew her broad brows together and said abruptly "He wouldn't really use bombs or that sort of thing?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	3274	3251	3292	Syme	She drew her broad brows together and said abruptly "He wouldn't really use bombs or that sort of thing?" [MASK] broke into a great laugh, that seemed too large for his slight and somewhat dandified figure.
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	3334	3300	3341	Gregory	he said, "that has to be done anonymously." And at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile, and she thought with a simultaneous pleasure of [MASK]'s absurdity and of his safety.
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	3342	3342	3386	Syme	[MASK] strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden, and continued to pour out his opinions. For he was a sincere man, and in spite of his superficial airs and graces, at root a humble one.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	3790	3743	3791	Gregory	The tall hat and long frock coat were black; the face, in an abrupt shadow, was almost as dark. Only a fringe of fiery hair against the light, and also something aggressive in the attitude, proclaimed that it was the poet [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	3945	3938	3980	Syme	"All the same," replied [MASK] patiently, "just at present you only see the tree by the light of the lamp. I wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree."
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	4128	4098	4139	Gregory	You did something to me that no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before." "Indeed!" "Now I remember," resumed [MASK] reflectively, "one other person succeeded in doing it.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	4196	4173	4219	Gregory	"I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped out even with an apology," said [MASK] very calmly. "No duel could wipe it out. If I struck you dead I could not wipe it out.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	4298	4289	4338	Syme	"There are degrees of seriousness," replied [MASK]. "I have never doubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense, that you thought what you said well worth saying, that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglected truth."
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	4339	4300	4347	Gregory	"I have never doubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense, that you thought what you said well worth saying, that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglected truth." [MASK] stared at him steadily and painfully. "
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	4397	4364	4415	Syme	You think me a _fl neur_ who lets fall occasional truths. You do not think that in a deeper, a more deadly sense, I am serious." [MASK] struck his stick violently on the stones of the road. "Serious!" he cried.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	4610	4577	4623	Adam	"Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your religion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to tell you to any son of [MASK], and especially not to the police? Will you swear that!
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	4675	4624	4681	Syme	If you will take upon yourself this awful abnegation if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream about, I will promise you in return " "You will promise me in return?" inquired [MASK], as the other paused.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	4693	4692	4741	Syme	" [MASK] suddenly took off his hat. "Your offer," he said, "is far too idiotic to be declined. You say that a poet is always an anarchist. I disagree; but I hope at least that he is always a sportsman.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	4805	4799	4842	Gregory	"I think," said [MASK], with placid irrelevancy, "that we will call a cab." He gave two long whistles, and a hansom came rattling down the road. The two got into it in silence.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	4843	4835	4884	Gregory	The two got into it in silence. [MASK] gave through the trap the address of an obscure public-house on the Chiswick bank of the river. The cab whisked itself away again, and in it these two fantastics quitted their fantastic town. CHAPTER II.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	4977	4934	4979	Gregory	The room was so small and dark, that very little could be seen of the attendant who was summoned, beyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and bearded. "Will you take a little supper?" asked [MASK] politely.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	5072	5064	5107	Gregory	"What will you drink?" resumed [MASK], with the same careless yet apologetic air. "I shall only have a _cr me de menthe_ myself; I have dined. But the champagne can really be trusted.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	5168	5141	5189	Syme	His further attempts at conversation, somewhat disorganised in themselves, were cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by the actual appearance of the lobster. [MASK] tasted it, and found it particularly good. Then he suddenly began to eat with great rapidity and appetite.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	5204	5190	5236	Gregory	"Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously!" he said to [MASK], smiling. "I don't often have the luck to have a dream like this. It is new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	5257	5208	5258	Gregory	"I don't often have the luck to have a dream like this. It is new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster. It is commonly the other way." "You are not asleep, I assure you," said [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	5513	5506	5551	Syme	"Try one of mine." [MASK] took the cigar, clipped the end off with a cigar-cutter out of his waistcoat pocket, put it in his mouth, lit it slowly, and let out a long cloud of smoke.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	5761	5761	5803	Gregory	[MASK] led him down a low, vaulted passage, at the end of which was the red light. It was an enormous crimson lantern, nearly as big as a fireplace, fixed over a small but heavy iron door.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	5819	5781	5836	Gregory	It was an enormous crimson lantern, nearly as big as a fireplace, fixed over a small but heavy iron door. In the door there was a sort of hatchway or grating, and on this [MASK] struck five times. A heavy voice with a foreign accent asked him who he was.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	6298	6257	6308	Syme	Well, you said that you were quite certain I was not a serious anarchist. Does this place strike you as being serious?" "It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety," assented [MASK]; "but may I ask you two questions?
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	6475	6439	6492	Man	We wish to deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue, honour and treachery, upon which mere rebels base themselves. The silly sentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of [MASK]! We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs. We have abolished Right and Wrong."
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	6501	6477	6524	Syme	We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs. We have abolished Right and Wrong." "And Right and Left," said [MASK] with a simple eagerness, "I hope you will abolish them too. They are much more troublesome to me."
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	6543	6537	6589	Syme	"With pleasure," resumed [MASK]. "In all your present acts and surroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy. I have an aunt who lived over a shop, but this is the first time I have found people living from preference under a public-house.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	6674	6674	6726	Gregory	[MASK] smiled. "The answer is simple," he said. "I told you I was a serious anarchist, and you did not believe me. Nor do _they_ believe me. Unless I took them into this infernal room they would not believe me."
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	6727	6687	6737	Syme	"I told you I was a serious anarchist, and you did not believe me. Nor do _they_ believe me. Unless I took them into this infernal room they would not believe me." [MASK] smoked thoughtfully, and looked at him with interest.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	6738	6738	6780	Gregory	[MASK] went on. "The history of the thing might amuse you," he said. "When first I became one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable disguises. I dressed up as a bishop.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	6941	6908	6958	Nietzsche	Then I tried being a major. Now I am a humanitarian myself, but I have, I hope, enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who, like [MASK], admire violence the proud, mad war of Nature and all that, you know.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	7343	7343	7393	Syme	[MASK] sat watching him with some respect in his large, blue eyes. "You took me in," he said. "It is really a smart dodge." Then after a pause he added "What do you call this tremendous President of yours?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	7403	7357	7406	Gregory	"You took me in," he said. "It is really a smart dodge." Then after a pause he added "What do you call this tremendous President of yours?" "We generally call him Sunday," replied [MASK] with simplicity.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	7569	7525	7575	Syme	Consequently, we have called a meeting this very evening to elect a successor." He got to his feet and strolled across the room with a sort of smiling embarrassment. "I feel somehow as if you were my mother, [MASK]," he continued casually.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	7690	7659	7702	Syme	" He looked down for a moment modestly. "It is almost a settled thing that I am to be Thursday." "My dear fellow." said [MASK] heartily, "I congratulate you. A great career!"
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	7703	7698	7748	Gregory	A great career!" [MASK] smiled in deprecation, and walked across the room, talking rapidly. "As a matter of fact, everything is ready for me on this table," he said, "and the ceremony will probably be the shortest possible."
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	7749	7749	7795	Syme	[MASK] also strolled across to the table, and found lying across it a walking-stick, which turned out on examination to be a sword-stick, a large Colt's revolver, a sandwich case, and a formidable flask of brandy.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	7896	7890	7941	Syme	And he clasped his hands. [MASK], who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor, got to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation. "Why is it," he asked vaguely, "that I think you are quite a decent fellow?
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	7949	7942	7996	Gregory	Why do I positively like you, [MASK]?" He paused a moment, and then added with a sort of fresh curiosity, "Is it because you are such an ass?" There was a thoughtful silence again, and then he cried out "Well, damn it all!
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	8019	7978	8032	Gregory	There was a thoughtful silence again, and then he cried out "Well, damn it all! this is the funniest situation I have ever been in in my life, and I am going to act accordingly. [MASK], I gave you a promise before I came into this place.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	8170	8159	8214	Gregory	Then after a pause, "Will you swear?" [MASK] glared at him gravely for a few moments, and then said abruptly "You must have bewitched me, but I feel a furious curiosity about you. Yes, I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	8231	8200	8252	Syme	Yes, I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me. But look sharp, for they will be here in a couple of minutes." [MASK] rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long, white hands into his long, grey trousers' pockets.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	8282	8277	8319	Syme	"Well," said [MASK] slowly, "I don't know how to tell you the truth more shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up as an aimless poet is not confined to you or your President.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	8491	8491	8536	Syme	[MASK] did not flinch, but he put up a pale and polite hand. "Don't be such a silly man," he said, with the effeminate dignity of a curate. "Don't you see it's not necessary?
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	8559	8527	8576	Gregory	"Don't you see it's not necessary? Don't you see that we're both in the same boat? Yes, and jolly sea-sick." [MASK] could not speak, but he could not fire either, and he looked his question.
TheManWhoWasThursday	59	8590	8577	8636	Syme	"Don't you see we've checkmated each other?" cried [MASK]. "I can't tell the police you are an anarchist. You can't tell the anarchists I'm a policeman. I can only watch you, knowing what you are; you can only watch me, knowing what I am.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	8999	8976	9022	Syme	"What branch do you represent?" he asked sharply. "I should hardly call it a branch," said [MASK], laughing; "I should call it at the very least a root." "What do you mean?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	9030	9016	9059	Syme	"What do you mean?" "The fact is," said [MASK] serenely, "the truth is I am a Sabbatarian. I have been specially sent here to see that you show a due observance of Sunday."
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	9091	9083	9135	Sunday	Evidently the awful President, whose name was [MASK], did sometimes send down such irregular ambassadors to such branch meetings. "Well, comrade," said the man with the papers after a pause, "I suppose we'd better give you a seat in the meeting?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	9148	9105	9160	Syme	"Well, comrade," said the man with the papers after a pause, "I suppose we'd better give you a seat in the meeting?" "If you ask my advice as a friend," said [MASK] with severe benevolence, "I think you'd better."
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	9321	9283	9327	Syme	After all, it was only one night's discussion, and only one detective who would know of it. He would let out as little as possible of their plans that night, and then let [MASK] go, and chance it.
TheManWhoWasThursday	59	9796	9796	9855	Gregory	[MASK] rose amid a great rumble of applause. His face was deadly pale, so that by contrast his queer red hair looked almost scarlet. But he was smiling and altogether at ease. He had made up his mind, and he saw his best policy quite plain in front of him like a white road.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	9941	9910	9958	Syme	He thought that with care he could succeed, in spite of all the people around him, in conveying an impression of the institution, subtly and delicately false. [MASK] had once thought that anarchists, under all their bravado, were only playing the fool.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	10708	10672	10719	Gregory	Superbly careless of the slanders that represent us as assassins and enemies of human society, we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure, the permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity." [MASK] resumed his seat and passed his hand across his forehead.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	11541	11506	11558	Gregory	At the moment when he announced himself as ready to stand for the post of Thursday, a roar of excitement and assent broke forth, and became uncontrollable, and at the same moment [MASK] sprang to his feet, with foam upon his mouth, and shouted against the shouting.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	11778	11767	11817	Gregory	"Stop all this, I tell you!" cried [MASK], with frantic face and hands. "Stop it, it is all " The voice of the chairman clove his speech with a cold accent. "Does anyone second this amendment?" he said.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	11847	11847	11896	Gregory	[MASK] had been screaming for some time past; now there was a change in his accent, more shocking than any scream. "I end all this!" he said, in a voice as heavy as stone. "This man cannot be elected.
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	11906	11871	11915	Syme	"I end all this!" he said, in a voice as heavy as stone. "This man cannot be elected. He is a " "Yes," said [MASK], quite motionless, "what is he?
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	11917	11916	11957	Gregory	" [MASK]'s mouth worked twice without sound; then slowly the blood began to crawl back into his dead face. "He is a man quite inexperienced in our work," he said, and sat down abruptly.
TheManWhoWasThursday	58	12078	12069	12127	Gregory	"I am not a madman," reiterated [MASK], with a frightful sincerity which for a moment staggered the room, "but I give you a counsel which you can call mad if you like. No, I will not call it a counsel, for I can give you no reason for it.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	12179	12135	12189	Syme	Call it a mad command, but act upon it. Strike, but hear me! Kill me, but obey me! Do not elect this man." Truth is so terrible, even in fetters, that for a moment [MASK]'s slender and insane victory swayed like a reed.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	12258	12253	12298	Gregory	"Comrades," cried [MASK], in a voice like that of a martyr who in an ecstacy of pain has passed beyond pain, "it is nothing to me whether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave.
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	12779	12768	12825	Buttons	At the end of the passage was a door, which [MASK] opened sharply, showing a sudden blue and silver picture of the moonlit river, that looked like a scene in a theatre. Close to the opening lay a dark, dwarfish steam-launch, like a baby dragon with one red eye.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	12924	12874	12925	Gregory	You have kept it even down to a small particular. There was one special thing you promised me at the beginning of the affair, and which you have certainly given me by the end of it." "What do you mean?" cried the chaotic [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	13715	13695	13746	Syme	Perhaps this was why a policeman on the Embankment spoke to him, and said "Good evening." [MASK], at a crisis of his morbid fears for humanity, seemed stung by the mere stolidity of the automatic official, a mere bulk of blue in the twilight.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	13874	13848	13895	Syme	"If we are calm," replied the policeman, "it is the calm of organised resistance." "Eh?" said [MASK], staring. "The soldier must be calm in the thick of the battle," pursued the policeman.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	13981	13929	13984	Syme	"No," said the policeman sadly, "I never had any of those advantages. The Board Schools came after my time. What education I had was very rough and old-fashioned, I am afraid." "Where did you have it?" asked [MASK], wondering.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	14083	14054	14104	Syme	"I know," he said solemnly, "I know I am not worthy." "But why did you join the police?" asked [MASK] with rude curiosity. "For much the same reason that you abused the police," replied the other.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	14170	14149	14192	Syme	I trust I make myself clear." "If you mean that you make your opinion clear," said [MASK], "I suppose you do. But as for making yourself clear, it is the last thing you do.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	14291	14241	14292	Syme	We are keeping it rather dark from the educated class, because that class contains most of our enemies. But you seem to be exactly in the right frame of mind. I think you might almost join us." "Join you in what?" asked [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	14458	14458	14509	Syme	[MASK]'s eyes were bright with a sympathetic curiosity. "What do you do, then?" he said. "The work of the philosophical policeman," replied the man in blue, "is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary detective.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	14855	14820	14874	Bigamists	They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it. But philosophers dislike property as property; they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession. [MASK] respect marriage, or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	14882	14875	14928	Murderers	But philosophers despise marriage as marriage. [MASK] respect human life; they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives. But philosophers hate life itself, their own as much as other people's."
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	14929	14913	14961	Syme	But philosophers hate life itself, their own as much as other people's." [MASK] struck his hands together. "How true that is," he cried. "I have felt it from my boyhood, but never could state the verbal antithesis.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	15249	15206	15259	Syme	A moment more, and you may lose the glory of working with us, perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes of the world." "It is a chance not to be missed, certainly," assented [MASK], "but still I do not quite understand.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	15529	15478	15530	Syme	They believe that if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless as the flowers of spring. They believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good. These I call the innocent section." "Oh!" said [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	15763	15724	15770	Syme	The innocent rank and file are disappointed because the bomb has not killed the king; but the high-priesthood are happy because it has killed somebody." "How can I join you?" asked [MASK], with a sort of passion.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	16079	16048	16095	Syme	"Are you the new recruit?" said the invisible chief, who seemed to have heard all about it. "All right. You are engaged." [MASK], quite swept off his feet, made a feeble fight against this irrevocable phrase.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	16155	16148	16195	Syme	"Well, really," said [MASK], "I don't know any profession of which mere willingness is the final test." "I do," said the other "martyrs. I am condemning you to death. Good day."
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	16444	16443	16485	Syme	When [MASK] stepped out on to the steam-tug he had a singular sensation of stepping out into something entirely new; not merely into the landscape of a new land, but even into the landscape of a new planet.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	17102	17088	17136	Syme	CHAPTER V. THE FEAST OF FEAR At first the large stone stair seemed to [MASK] as deserted as a pyramid; but before he reached the top he had realised that there was a man leaning over the parapet of the Embankment and looking out across the river.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	17275	17240	17292	Syme	This scrap of hair almost seemed a mere oversight; the rest of the face was of the type that is best shaven clear-cut, ascetic, and in its way noble. [MASK] drew closer and closer, noting all this, and still the figure did not stir.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	17392	17392	17440	Syme	[MASK] looked again and again at the pale, dignified and delicate face, and the face still looked blankly across the river. Then he took out of his pocket the note from Buttons proving his election, and put it before that sad and beautiful face.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	17647	17642	17694	Syme	"No," said [MASK]. "Nor have I," answered the man in an ordinary tone. "I shall try to get to bed after breakfast." He spoke with casual civility, but in an utterly dead voice that contradicted the fanaticism of his face.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	17822	17803	17849	Sunday	Originally, of course, we met in a cell underground, just as your branch does. Then [MASK] made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant. He said that if you didn't seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	17920	17910	17952	Syme	"And what do the people say?" asked [MASK]. "It's quite simple what they say," answered his guide. "They say we are a lot of jolly gentlemen who pretend they are anarchists."
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	17965	17922	17969	Syme	"It's quite simple what they say," answered his guide. "They say we are a lot of jolly gentlemen who pretend they are anarchists." "It seems to me a very clever idea," said [MASK]. "Clever!
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	18004	17975	18017	Sunday	Clever!" cried out the other in a sudden, shrill voice which was as startling and discordant as his crooked smile. "When you've seen [MASK] for a split second you'll leave off calling him clever."
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	18457	18428	18478	Syme	At the nearest end of the balcony, blocking up a great part of the perspective, was the back of a great mountain of a man. When [MASK] had seen him, his first thought was that the weight of him must break down the balcony of stone.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	18568	18537	18583	Syme	The ears that stood out from it looked larger than human ears. He was enlarged terribly to scale; and this sense of size was so staggering, that when [MASK] saw him all the other figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	18616	18584	18639	Syme	They were still sitting there as before with their flowers and frock-coats, but now it looked as if the big man was entertaining five children to tea. As [MASK] and the guide approached the side door of the hotel, a waiter came out smiling with every tooth in his head.
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	18752	18739	18780	Syme	He knew it was so, with an unaccountable but instantaneous certainty. [MASK], indeed, was one of those men who are open to all the more nameless psychological influences in a degree a little dangerous to mental health.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	19487	19477	19529	Gogol	"I am not good at concealment," said [MASK] sulkily, with a thick foreign accent; "I am not ashamed of the cause." "Yes you are, my boy, and so is the cause of you," said the President good-naturedly.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	19603	19562	19614	Tuesday	When a householder finds a man under his bed, he will probably pause to note the circumstance. But if he finds a man under his bed in a top hat, you will agree with me, my dear [MASK], that he is not likely even to forget it.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	19674	19641	19684	Syme	"Right, my boy, right," said the President with a ponderous heartiness, "you aren't good at anything." While this stream of conversation continued, [MASK] was looking more steadily at the men around him.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	19858	19846	19896	Syme	Only the individual examples will express this half-concealed eccentricity. [MASK]'s original cicerone bore the title of Monday; he was the Secretary of the Council, and his twisted smile was regarded with more terror than anything, except the President's horrible, happy laughter.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	19923	19915	19968	Syme	His fine face was so emaciated, that [MASK] thought it must be wasted with some disease; yet somehow the very distress of his dark eyes denied this. It was no physical ill that troubled him. His eyes were alive with intellectual torture, as if pure thought was pain.
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	20072	20052	20096	Syme	He had a black French beard cut square and a black English frock-coat cut even squarer. But [MASK], sensitive to such things, felt somehow that the man carried a rich atmosphere with him, a rich atmosphere that suffocated.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	20358	20324	20373	Gogol	His face was as grey as his long grey beard, his forehead was lifted and fixed finally in a furrow of mild despair. In no other case, not even that of [MASK], did the bridegroom brilliancy of the morning dress express a more painful contrast.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	20618	20596	20643	Syme	It may have been merely a crescendo of nervous fancy that had gone before, but those black discs were dreadful to [MASK]; they reminded him of half-remembered ugly tales, of some story about pennies being put on the eyes of the dead.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	20644	20644	20697	Syme	[MASK]'s eye always caught the black glasses and the blind grin. Had the dying Professor worn them, or even the pale Secretary, they would have been appropriate. But on the younger and grosser man they seemed only an enigma. They took away the key of the face.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	20731	20689	20743	Syme	They took away the key of the face. You could not tell what his smile or his gravity meant. Partly from this, and partly because he had a vulgar virility wanting in most of the others it seemed to [MASK] that he might be the wickedest of all those wicked men.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	20785	20782	20831	Syme	Again and again [MASK] strove to pull together his common sense in their presence. Sometimes he saw for an instant that these notions were subjective, that he was only looking at ordinary men, one of whom was old, another nervous, another short-sighted.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	21156	21142	21194	Syme	Ordinarily speaking, the proximity of this positive and objective crime would have sobered [MASK], and cured him of all his merely mystical tremors. He would have thought of nothing but the need of saving at least two human bodies from being ripped in pieces with iron and roaring gas.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	21310	21301	21351	Syme	But there was one persistent thing which first troubled [MASK] and at last terrified him. The President was always looking at him, steadily, and with a great and baffling interest. The enormous man was quite quiet, but his blue eyes stood out of his head.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	21358	21317	21359	Syme	The President was always looking at him, steadily, and with a great and baffling interest. The enormous man was quite quiet, but his blue eyes stood out of his head. And they were always fixed on [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	21405	21390	21443	Sunday	He had hardly the shred of a doubt that in some silent and extraordinary way [MASK] had found out that he was a spy. He looked over the edge of the balcony, and saw a policeman, standing abstractedly just beneath, staring at the bright railings and the sunlit trees.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	21490	21444	21497	Gregory	Then there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment him for many days. In the presence of these powerful and repulsive men, who were the princes of anarchy, he had almost forgotten the frail and fanciful figure of the poet [MASK], the mere aesthete of anarchism.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	21527	21498	21553	Gregory	He even thought of him now with an old kindness, as if they had played together when children. But he remembered that he was still tied to [MASK] by a great promise. He had promised never to do the very thing that he now felt himself almost in the act of doing.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	21804	21787	21835	Sunday	Either by anonymous poison or sudden street accident, by hypnotism or by fire from hell, [MASK] could certainly strike him. If he defied the man he was probably dead, either struck stiff there in his chair or long afterwards as by an innocent ailment.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	21961	21916	21966	Sunday	It never occurred to him to be spiritually won over to the enemy. Many moderns, inured to a weak worship of intellect and force, might have wavered in their allegiance under this oppression of a great personality. They might have called [MASK] the super-man.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	22042	21997	22051	Syme	He might have been called something above man, with his large plans, which were too obvious to be detected, with his large face, which was too frank to be understood. But this was a kind of modern meanness to which [MASK] could not sink even in his extreme morbidity.
TheManWhoWasThursday	59	22229	22171	22230	Syme	For he ate like twenty men; he ate incredibly, with a frightful freshness of appetite, so that it was like watching a sausage factory. Yet continually, when he had swallowed a dozen crumpets or drunk a quart of coffee, he would be found with his great head on one side staring at [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	22581	22554	22602	Wednesday	There was a singular silence, and then the Secretary said "We are wandering, however, from the point. The only question is how [MASK] is to strike the blow. I take it we should all agree with the original notion of a bomb.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	22684	22684	22732	Syme	[MASK] stood up before any of the others. The instant of choice had come at last, the pistol was at his head. On the pavement before he could hear the policeman idly stir and stamp, for the morning, though bright, was cold.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	22750	22733	22778	Syme	A barrel-organ in the street suddenly sprang with a jerk into a jovial tune. [MASK] stood up taut, as if it had been a bugle before the battle. He found himself filled with a supernatural courage that came from nowhere.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	23049	23013	23061	Roland	All was swallowed up in an ultimate certainty that the President was wrong and that the barrel-organ was right. There clanged in his mind that unanswerable and terrible truism in the song of [MASK] "Pa ens ont tort et Chr tiens ont droit."
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	23223	23223	23280	Syme	[MASK] went last, outwardly calm, but with all his brain and body throbbing with romantic rhythm. The President led them down an irregular side stair, such as might be used by servants, and into a dim, cold, empty room, with a table and benches, like an abandoned boardroom.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	23314	23314	23364	Zso	[MASK]!" he cried, with an obscure excitement, his heavy Polish accent becoming almost impenetrable. "You zay you nod ide. You zay you show himselves. It is all nuzzinks. Ven you vant talk importance you run yourselves in a dark box!"
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	23390	23351	23400	Gogol	Ven you vant talk importance you run yourselves in a dark box!" The President seemed to take the foreigner's incoherent satire with entire good humour. "You can't get hold of it yet, [MASK]," he said in a fatherly way. "
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	23578	23540	23595	Syme	And now may I ask you to control your beautiful sentiments, and sit down with the other gentlemen at this table. For the first time this morning something intelligent is going to be said." [MASK], with the perturbed promptitude he had shown since the original summons, sat down first.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	23612	23609	23655	Syme	No one except [MASK] seemed to have any notion of the blow that was about to fall. As for him, he had merely the feeling of a man mounting the scaffold with the intention, at any rate, of making a good speech.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	23796	23766	23817	Sunday	They all stared at him; then they all started in their seats, for the next words, though not loud, had a living and sensational emphasis. [MASK] struck the table. "Not one word more about the plans and places must be said at this meeting.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	23837	23818	23860	Sunday	Not one tiny detail more about what we mean to do must be mentioned in this company." [MASK] had spent his life in astonishing his followers; but it seemed as if he had never really astonished them until now.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	23870	23861	23906	Syme	They all moved feverishly in their seats, except [MASK]. He sat stiff in his, with his hand in his pocket, and on the handle of his loaded revolver. When the attack on him came he would sell his life dear.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	23919	23894	23944	Sunday	When the attack on him came he would sell his life dear. He would find out at least if the President was mortal. [MASK] went on smoothly "You will probably understand that there is only one possible motive for forbidding free speech at this festival of freedom.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	24077	24042	24090	Syme	"Yes," he said slowly, "there is a spy in this room. There is a traitor at this table. I will waste no more words. His name " [MASK] half rose from his seat, his finger firm on the trigger.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	24118	24102	24149	Gogol	"He is that hairy humbug over there who pretends to be a Pole." [MASK] sprang to his feet, a pistol in each hand. With the same flash three men sprang at his throat. Even the Professor made an effort to rise.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	24151	24130	24182	Syme	With the same flash three men sprang at his throat. Even the Professor made an effort to rise. But [MASK] saw little of the scene, for he was blinded with a beneficent darkness; he had sunk down into his seat shuddering, in a palsy of passionate relief.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	24320	24285	24337	Syme	The alleged Pole was a little pale under his tangle of dark hair, but he put two fingers into the pocket with apparent coolness and pulled out a blue strip of card. When [MASK] saw it lying on the table, he woke up again to the world outside him.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	24495	24444	24496	Sunday	It made everyone jump to hear a clear, commercial and somewhat cockney voice coming out of that forest of foreign hair. It was irrational, as if a Chinaman had suddenly spoken with a Scotch accent. "I gather that you fully understand your position," said [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	24545	24515	24565	Sunday	All I say is, I don't believe any Pole could have imitated my accent like I did his." "I concede the point," said [MASK]. "I believe your own accent to be inimitable, though I shall practise it in my bath.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	24584	24566	24613	Gogol	Do you mind leaving your beard with your card?" "Not a bit," answered [MASK]; and with one finger he ripped off the whole of his shaggy head-covering, emerging with thin red hair and a pale, pert face.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	24635	24614	24665	Sunday	"It was hot," he added. "I will do you the justice to say," said [MASK], not without a sort of brutal admiration, "that you seem to have kept pretty cool under it. Now listen to me. I like you.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	24744	24719	24765	Gogol	On your discomfort I will not dwell. Good day. Mind the step." The red-haired detective who had masqueraded as [MASK] rose to his feet without a word, and walked out of the room with an air of perfect nonchalance.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	25192	25157	25210	Syme	And with these words he shouldered his way out of the room, shaking with incomprehensible scorn. Four of the men left behind gaped after him without any apparent glimmering of his meaning. [MASK] alone had even a glimmering, and such as it was it froze him to the bone.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	25292	25254	25305	Syme	The other four got to their feet grumbling more or less, and betook themselves elsewhere to find lunch, for it was already well past midday. The Professor went last, very slowly and painfully. [MASK] sat long after the rest had gone, revolving his strange position.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	25635	25621	25667	Syme	It scarcely seemed the place for a person of his years and infirmities. [MASK] was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this dehumanized brotherhood; but even he could not believe that the Professor had fallen in love with that particular wax lady.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	25742	25708	25761	Syme	On the contrary, he rather congratulated himself that the Professor's stroke and his elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to escape from him and leave him miles behind. For [MASK] thirsted first and last to get clear of the whole poisonous atmosphere, if only for an hour.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	26080	26039	26090	Syme	At a small table, close up to the blank window and the white street of snow, sat the old anarchist Professor over a glass of milk, with his lifted livid face and pendent eyelids. For an instant [MASK] stood as rigid as the stick he leant upon.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	26389	26389	26436	Syme	[MASK], who was commonly a cool character, was literally gaping as a rustic gapes at a conjuring trick. He had seen no cab following; he had heard no wheels outside the shop; to all mortal appearances the man had come on foot.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	26449	26437	26485	Syme	But the old man could only walk like a snail, and [MASK] had walked like the wind. He started up and snatched his stick, half crazy with the contradiction in mere arithmetic, and swung out of the swinging doors, leaving his coffee untasted.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	27030	27026	27079	Syme	On each side of [MASK] the walls of the alley were blind and featureless; there was no little window or any kind of eve. He felt a new impulse to break out of this hive of houses, and to get once more into the open and lamp-lit street.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	27645	27608	27650	Syme	And the old Professor came right up to him and passed him like a total stranger, without even a blink of his mournful eyelids. There was something in this silent and unexpected innocence that left [MASK] in a final fury.
TheManWhoWasThursday	56	27670	27670	27726	Syme	[MASK] was galvanised with an energy that was something between bitterness and a burst of boyish derision. He made a wild gesture as if to knock the old man's hat off, called out something like "Catch me if you can," and went racing away across the white, open Circus.
TheManWhoWasThursday	59	27825	27824	27883	Syme	Then [MASK] broke away towards the river, and ended almost down by the docks. He saw the yellow panes of a low, lighted public-house, flung himself into it and ordered beer. It was a foul tavern, sprinkled with foreign sailors, a place where opium might be smoked or knives drawn.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	28141	28120	28167	Syme	He was just selecting a tentative inquiry, when the old Professor opposite suddenly and simply cut him short. Before [MASK] could ask the first diplomatic question, the old anarchist had asked suddenly, without any sort of preparation "Are you a policeman?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	28170	28168	28215	Syme	Whatever else [MASK] had expected, he had never expected anything so brutal and actual as this. Even his great presence of mind could only manage a reply with an air of rather blundering jocularity. "A policeman?" he said, laughing vaguely.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	28275	28252	28302	Syme	I think so now." "Did I take a policeman's hat by mistake out of the restaurant?" asked [MASK], smiling wildly. "Have I by any chance got a number stuck on to me somewhere? Have my boots got that watchful look?
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	28335	28303	28354	Syme	Why must I be a policeman? Do, do let me be a postman." The old Professor shook his head with a gravity that gave no hope, but [MASK] ran on with a feverish irony. "But perhaps I misunderstood the delicacies of your German philosophy.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	28452	28413	28465	Syme	I don't mind being the policeman that might have been. I don't mind being anything in German thought." "Are you in the police service?" said the old man, ignoring all [MASK]'s improvised and desperate raillery. "Are you a detective?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	28466	28459	28510	Syme	"Are you a detective?" [MASK]'s heart turned to stone, but his face never changed. "Your suggestion is ridiculous," he began. "Why on earth " The old man struck his palsied hand passionately on the rickety table, nearly breaking it.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	28554	28549	28600	Syme	"No!" answered [MASK], like a man standing on the hangman's drop. "You swear it," said the old man, leaning across to him, his dead face becoming as it were loathsomely alive. "You swear it! You swear it!
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	28707	28663	28711	Syme	You are not in the British police?" He leant his angular elbow far across the table, and put up his large loose hand like a flap to his ear. "I am not in the British police," said [MASK] with insane calm.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	28744	28728	28775	Syme	"That's a pity," he said, "because I am." [MASK] sprang up straight, sending back the bench behind him with a crash. "Because you are what?" he said thickly. "You are what?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	29104	29075	29124	Syme	There comes a certain point in such conditions when only three things are possible: first a perpetuation of Satanic pride, secondly tears, and third laughter. [MASK]'s egotism held hard to the first course for a few seconds, and then suddenly adopted the third.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	29202	29171	29214	Syme	Even in that close den, perpetually filled with the din of knives, plates, cans, clamorous voices, sudden struggles and stampedes, there was something Homeric in [MASK]'s mirth which made many half-drunken men look round.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	29238	29232	29279	Syme	"At myself," answered [MASK], and went off again into the agony of his ecstatic reaction. "Pull yourself together," said the Professor, "or you'll get hysterical. Have some more beer. I'll join you."
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	29290	29280	29333	Syme	"You haven't drunk your milk," said [MASK]. "My milk!" said the other, in tones of withering and unfathomable contempt, "my milk! Do you think I'd look at the beastly stuff when I'm out of sight of the bloody anarchists?
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	29399	29361	29408	Syme	Finish my milk? Great blazes! yes, I'll finish it right enough!" and he knocked the tumbler off the table, making a crash of glass and a splash of silver fluid. [MASK] was staring at him with a happy curiosity.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	29493	29458	29505	Syme	As to whether I'm an old man, that's not for me to say. I was thirty-eight last birthday." "Yes, but I mean," said [MASK] impatiently, "there's nothing the matter with you."
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	29523	29515	29561	Syme	"I am subject to colds." [MASK]'s laughter at all this had about it a wild weakness of relief. He laughed at the idea of the paralytic Professor being really a young actor dressed up as if for the foot-lights.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	29602	29562	29611	Gogol	But he felt that he would have laughed as loudly if a pepperpot had fallen over. The false Professor drank and wiped his false beard. "Did you know," he asked, "that that man [MASK] was one of us?" "I?
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	29683	29653	29703	Syme	"I thought the President was talking about me, and I rattled in my boots." "And I thought he was talking about me," said [MASK], with his rather reckless laughter. "I had my hand on my revolver all the time."
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	29722	29722	29764	Syme	[MASK] struck the table with an exclamation. "Why, there were three of us there!" he cried. "Three out of seven is a fighting number. If we had only known that we were three!"
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	29816	29780	29821	Syme	"We were three," he said. "If we had been three hundred we could still have done nothing." "Not if we were three hundred against four?" asked [MASK], jeering rather boisterously.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	29997	29979	30029	Syme	Are you afraid of this man?" The Professor lifted his heavy lids, and gazed at [MASK] with large, wide-open, blue eyes of an almost ethereal honesty. "Yes, I am," he said mildly. "So are you."
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	30030	30030	30079	Syme	[MASK] was dumb for an instant. Then he rose to his feet erect, like an insulted man, and thrust the chair away from him. "Yes," he said in a voice indescribable, "you are right. I am afraid of him.
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	30151	30128	30169	Syme	"How?" asked the staring Professor. "Why?" "Because I am afraid of him," said [MASK]; "and no man should leave in the universe anything of which he is afraid."
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	30190	30182	30234	Syme	He made an effort to speak, but [MASK] went on in a low voice, but with an undercurrent of inhuman exaltation "Who would condescend to strike down the mere things that he does not fear? Who would debase himself to be merely brave, like any common prizefighter?
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	30345	30312	30354	Sunday	So I say to you, strike upwards, if you strike at the stars." The other looked at the ceiling, one of the tricks of his pose. "[MASK] is a fixed star," he said.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	30562	30556	30599	Syme	"Confound it!" cried [MASK]. "And we don't know where he is." "Yes," said the other in his curious, absent-minded way, "I know where he is myself."
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	30608	30565	30612	Syme	And we don't know where he is." "Yes," said the other in his curious, absent-minded way, "I know where he is myself." "Will you tell me?" asked [MASK] with eager eyes.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	30635	30613	30663	Syme	"I will take you there," said the Professor, and took down his own hat from a peg. [MASK] stood looking at him with a sort of rigid excitement. "What do you mean?" he asked sharply. "Will you join me?
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	30833	30833	30883	Syme	[MASK] felt almost dazed as he stepped through this growing confusion of lights and shadows; but his companion walked on with a certain briskness, towards where, at the end of the street, an inch or two of the lamplit river looked like a bar of flame.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	31648	31620	31671	Gogol	Even at the start I thought he was a bit too hairy." "A difference of artistic theory," replied the Professor pensively. "[MASK] was an idealist. He made up as the abstract or platonic ideal of an anarchist. But I am a realist.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	31710	31672	31722	Syme	I am a portrait painter. But, indeed, to say that I am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression. I am a portrait." "I don't understand you," said [MASK]. "I am a portrait," repeated the Professor.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	31757	31745	31797	Syme	"You mean you are made up like him," said [MASK]. "But doesn't he know that you are taking his nose in vain?" "He knows it right enough," replied his friend cheerfully. "Then why doesn't he denounce you?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	31816	31788	31837	Syme	"Then why doesn't he denounce you?" "I have denounced him," answered the Professor. "Do explain yourself," said [MASK]. "With pleasure, if you don't mind hearing my story," replied the eminent foreign philosopher.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	31850	31819	31868	Wilks	With pleasure, if you don't mind hearing my story," replied the eminent foreign philosopher. "I am by profession an actor, and my name is [MASK]. When I was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of Bohemian and blackguard company.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	32740	32735	32786	Syme	"Well," said [MASK], "I can understand your putting on his dirty old beard for a night's practical joke, but I don't understand your never taking it off again." "That is the rest of the story," said the impersonator.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	33088	33043	33095	Syme	He offered me a good salary and this little blue card. Though our conversation was short, he struck me as a man of very massive common sense and humour; but I cannot tell you much about him personally, because " [MASK] laid down his knife and fork.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	33164	33152	33198	Syme	"You don't look as if it were," said [MASK]; "you drink it as if it were medicine." "You must excuse my manner," said the Professor dismally, "my position is rather a curious one.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	33328	33300	33349	Syme	You should hear me say, Buck up, old cock!' It would bring tears to your eyes." "It does," said [MASK]; "but I cannot help thinking that apart from all that you are really a bit worried."
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	33435	33395	33450	Syme	There is a great problem to face," and he sank his bald brow in his two hands. Then he said in a low voice "Can you play the piano?" "Yes," said [MASK] in simple wonder, "I'm supposed to have a good touch."
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	33510	33472	33517	Syme	After a long silence, the Professor said out of the cavernous shadow of his hands "It would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter." "Thank you," said [MASK], "you flatter me."
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	33784	33770	33816	Syme	"I mentioned the piano because it gives one quick and independent fingers. [MASK], if we are to go through this interview and come out sane or alive, we must have some code of signals between us that this brute will not see.
TheManWhoWasThursday	58	33860	33817	33875	Syme	I have made a rough alphabetical cypher corresponding to the five fingers like this, see," and he rippled with his fingers on the wooden table "B A D, bad, a word we may frequently require." [MASK] poured himself out another glass of wine, and began to study the scheme.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	33963	33922	33964	Syme	But wine and companionship had always the effect of inspiring him to a farcical ingenuity, and the Professor soon found himself struggling with the too vast energy of the new language, as it passed through the heated brain of [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	33976	33965	34016	Syme	"We must have several word-signs," said [MASK] seriously "words that we are likely to want, fine shades of meaning. My favourite word is coeval'. What's yours?" "Do stop playing the goat," said the Professor plaintively.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	34035	34004	34057	Syme	"Do stop playing the goat," said the Professor plaintively. "You don't know how serious this is." " Lush' too," said [MASK], shaking his head sagaciously, "we must have lush' word applied to grass, don't you know?
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	34174	34169	34216	Syme	"Perfectly," replied [MASK]; "always be comic in a tragedy. What the deuce else can you do? I wish this language of yours had a wider scope. I suppose we could not extend it from the fingers to the toes?
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	34236	34203	34252	Syme	I suppose we could not extend it from the fingers to the toes? That would involve pulling off our boots and socks during the conversation, which however unobtrusively performed " "[MASK]," said his friend with a stern simplicity, "go to bed!"
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	34253	34253	34298	Syme	[MASK], however, sat up in bed for a considerable time mastering the new code. He was awakened next morning while the east was still sealed with darkness, and found his grey-bearded ally standing like a ghost beside his bed.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	34299	34270	34322	Syme	He was awakened next morning while the east was still sealed with darkness, and found his grey-bearded ally standing like a ghost beside his bed. [MASK] sat up in bed blinking; then slowly collected his thoughts, threw off the bed-clothes, and stood up.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	34389	34359	34409	Syme	He still felt an entire trust and loyalty towards his companion; but it was the trust between two men going to the scaffold. "Well," said [MASK] with a forced cheerfulness as he pulled on his trousers, "I dreamt of that alphabet of yours.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	34443	34410	34461	Syme	Did it take you long to make it up?" The Professor made no answer, but gazed in front of him with eyes the colour of a wintry sea; so [MASK] repeated his question. "I say, did it take you long to invent all this?
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	34537	34510	34561	Syme	"How long did it take you?" The Professor did not move. "Confound you, can't you answer?" called out [MASK], in a sudden anger that had something like fear underneath. Whether or no the Professor could answer, he did not.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	34562	34550	34597	Syme	Whether or no the Professor could answer, he did not. [MASK] stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the blank, blue eyes. His first thought was that the Professor had gone mad, but his second thought was more frightful.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	34653	34618	34666	Gogol	What did he know, except that the man had been at the anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous tale? How improbable it was that there should be another friend there beside [MASK]! Was this man's silence a sensational way of declaring war?
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	34755	34755	34807	Syme	[MASK] watched the twinkling movements of the talking hand, and read clearly the message "I will only talk like this. We must get used to it." He rapped out the answer with the impatience of relief "All right. Let's get out to breakfast."
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	34819	34778	34830	Syme	We must get used to it." He rapped out the answer with the impatience of relief "All right. Let's get out to breakfast." They took their hats and sticks in silence; but as [MASK] took his sword-stick, he held it hard.
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	34871	34831	34872	Acheron	They paused for a few minutes only to stuff down coffee and coarse thick sandwiches at a coffee stall, and then made their way across the river, which under the grey and growing light looked as desolate as [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	34967	34946	34990	Syme	From each the innumerable roofs of slate looked like the leaden surges of a grey, troubled sea after rain. [MASK] was increasingly conscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold sanity worse than the wild adventures of the past.
TheManWhoWasThursday	56	35733	35715	35771	Syme	But the little Doctor continued only to stare and smile, and the monologue was uphill work. [MASK] began to feel a new sickness and despair. The Doctor's smile and silence were not at all like the cataleptic stare and horrible silence which he had confronted in the Professor half an hour before.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	36036	36017	36070	Syme	He read the message, "You must go on. This devil has sucked me dry!" [MASK] plunged into the breach with that bravado of improvisation which always came to him when he was alarmed. "Yes, the thing really happened to me," he said hastily.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	36183	36148	36200	Syme	"So unless you or I can get on his track " The Doctor was still smiling in the most friendly way, and his protected eyes were still impenetrable. The Professor signalled to [MASK] that he would resume his explanation, and he began again with the same elaborate calm.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	36283	36263	36309	Syme	The nerves of both comrades-in-arms were near snapping under that strain of motionless amiability, when [MASK] suddenly leant forward and idly tapped the edge of the table. His message to his ally ran, "I have an intuition."
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	36331	36296	36349	Syme	His message to his ally ran, "I have an intuition." The Professor, with scarcely a pause in his monologue, signalled back, "Then sit on it." [MASK] telegraphed, "It is quite extraordinary." The other answered, "Extraordinary rot!"
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	36372	36360	36408	Syme	The other retorted, "You are a dead man." [MASK] had gone quite red up to his yellow hair, and his eyes were burning feverishly. As he said he had an intuition, and it had risen to a sort of lightheaded certainty.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	36488	36466	36514	Syme	The Professor then resumed his merely verbal monologue addressed to the Doctor. "Perhaps I should rather say," said [MASK] on his fingers, "that it resembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the heart of lush woods."
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	36747	36747	36798	Syme	[MASK] sprang to his feet, stepping backwards a little, like a chemical lecturer from a successful explosion. His eyes were like stars, and for an instant he could only point without speaking. The Professor had also started to his feet, forgetful of his supposed paralysis.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	37014	37012	37055	Syme	" roared [MASK], beside himself. "Look at him! Look at his face, look at his collar, look at his blessed boots! You don't suppose, do you, that that thing's an anarchist?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	37057	37019	37067	Syme	"Look at him! Look at his face, look at his collar, look at his blessed boots! You don't suppose, do you, that that thing's an anarchist?" "[MASK]!" cried the other in an apprehensive agony.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	37251	37222	37277	Syme	Clapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin glasses, the Doctor moved so quickly towards the door, that the others instinctively followed him. [MASK] seemed a little distrait, and as he passed under the doorway he suddenly struck his stick on the stone passage so that it rang.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	37321	37312	37366	Bull	"We might have fought easily," said [MASK]; "we were four against three." The Professor was descending the stairs, but his voice came up from below. "No," said the voice, "we were not four against three we were not so lucky.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	37371	37331	37382	One	The Professor was descending the stairs, but his voice came up from below. "No," said the voice, "we were not four against three we were not so lucky. We were four against [MASK]." The others went down the stairs in silence.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	37387	37383	37436	Bull	The young man called [MASK], with an innocent courtesy characteristic of him, insisted on going last until they reached the street; but there his own robust rapidity asserted itself unconsciously, and he walked quickly on ahead towards a railway inquiry office, talking to the others over his shoulder.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	37470	37450	37496	Gogol	"I've been half dead with the jumps, being quite alone. I nearly flung my arms round [MASK] and embraced him, which would have been imprudent. I hope you won't despise me for having been in a blue funk."
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	37508	37497	37545	Syme	"All the blue devils in blue hell," said [MASK], "contributed to my blue funk! But the worst devil was you and your infernal goggles." The young man laughed delightedly. "Wasn't it a rag?" he said.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	37926	37873	37927	Syme	As I say, it was simple enough when it was done, like miracles; but that wasn't the really miraculous part of it. There was one really staggering thing about the business, and my head still turns at it." "What was that?" asked [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	38010	37985	38036	Bull	"How was that?" he asked. "I thought you talked to him." "So I did," said [MASK] brightly; "but we talked in a pitch-dark room like a coalcellar. There, you would never have guessed that."
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	38047	38027	38072	Syme	There, you would never have guessed that." "I could not have conceived it," said [MASK] gravely. "It is indeed a new idea," said the Professor. Their new ally was in practical matters a whirlwind.
TheManWhoWasThursday	59	38401	38395	38454	Syme	"Not I," said [MASK]. "Theoretically I ought to drown myself first. I promised a poor fellow, who was a real modern pessimist, on my word of honour not to tell the police. I'm no hand at casuistry, but I can't break my word to a modern pessimist.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	38690	38649	38691	Syme	It's like whipping a leper. I may be mad, but that's how I feel; and there's jolly well the end of it." "I don't think you're mad," said [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	38766	38740	38795	Syme	Then he strolled back again, kicking his heels carelessly, and a companionable silence fell between the three men. "Well," said [MASK], "it seems that we have all the same kind of morality or immorality, so we had better face the fact that comes of it."
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	39243	39212	39261	Syme	Since 1350 the tree is quite clear." "He's gone off his head," said the little Doctor, staring. "Our bearings," continued [MASK] calmly, "are argent a chevron gules charged with three cross crosslets of the field.'
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	39797	39778	39828	Syme	What are you really going to do?" "But it was a lovely catechism," said [MASK] pathetically. "Do let me read it you. It has only forty-three questions and answers, and some of the Marquis's answers are wonderfully witty.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	39947	39930	39975	Syme	In that case, I understand, your own epigrams may appear somewhat more forced." [MASK] struck the table with a radiant face. "Why, how true that is," he said, "and I never thought of it.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	40016	39993	40047	Syme	"Oh, you're as drunk as an owl!" said the Doctor. "It only remains," continued [MASK] quite unperturbed, "to adopt some other method of breaking the ice (if I may so express it) between myself and the man I wish to kill.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	40406	40406	40457	Syme	[MASK] drained his last glass of sparkling wine. "I am," he said, pointing across to the Marquis and his companions, "that meeting. That meeting displeases me. I am going to pull that meeting's great ugly, mahogany-coloured nose."
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	40598	40573	40618	Syme	"Insulted you?" cried the gentleman with the red rosette, "when?" "Oh, just now," said [MASK] recklessly. "He insulted my mother." "Insulted your mother!" exclaimed the gentleman incredulously.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	40626	40608	40659	Syme	"Insulted your mother!" exclaimed the gentleman incredulously. "Well, anyhow," said [MASK], conceding a point, "my aunt." "But how can the Marquis have insulted your aunt just now?" said the second gentleman with some legitimate wonder.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	40682	40637	40684	Syme	"But how can the Marquis have insulted your aunt just now?" said the second gentleman with some legitimate wonder. "He has been sitting here all the time." "Ah, it was what he said!" said [MASK] darkly.
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	40733	40729	40773	Wagner	"My aunt played [MASK] badly. It was a painful subject. We are always being insulted about it." "This seems most extraordinary," said the gentleman who was _d cor _, looking doubtfully at the Marquis.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	40783	40751	40804	Syme	"This seems most extraordinary," said the gentleman who was _d cor _, looking doubtfully at the Marquis. "Oh, I assure you," said [MASK] earnestly, "the whole of your conversation was simply packed with sinister allusions to my aunt's weaknesses."
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	40851	40805	40853	Syme	"This is nonsense!" said the second gentleman. "I for one have said nothing for half an hour except that I liked the singing of that girl with black hair." "Well, there you are again!" said [MASK] indignantly.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	40978	40971	41022	Syme	Let us fight this evening." [MASK] bowed with a quite beautiful graciousness. "Marquis," he said, "your action is worthy of your fame and blood. Permit me to consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose hands I shall place myself."
TheManWhoWasThursday	56	41329	41329	41385	Syme	[MASK] was subject to spasms of singular common sense, not otherwise a part of his character. They were (as he said of his impulse about the spectacles) poetic intuitions, and they sometimes rose to the exaltation of prophecy. He had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his opponent.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	41395	41373	41425	Syme	He had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his opponent. When the Marquis was informed by his seconds that [MASK] could only fight in the morning, he must fully have realised that an obstacle had suddenly arisen between him and his bomb-throwing business in the capital.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	41443	41426	41473	Syme	Naturally he could not explain this objection to his friends, so he chose the course which [MASK] had predicted. He induced his seconds to settle on a small meadow not far from the railway, and he trusted to the fatality of the first engagement.
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	42021	41984	42041	Syme	_" broke from the Marquis behind, whose face had suddenly darkened, "let us stop talking and begin," and he slashed off the head of a tall flower with his stick. [MASK] understood his rude impatience and instinctively looked over his shoulder to see whether the train was coming in sight.
TheManWhoWasThursday	58	43054	43024	43082	Syme	He fought wildly and even weakly, and he constantly looked away at the railway line, almost as if he feared the train more than the pointed steel. [MASK], on the other hand, fought fiercely but still carefully, in an intellectual fury, eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	43162	43128	43177	Syme	Half mad, he thrust again, and made what should have been a bloody scar on the Marquis's cheek. But there was no scar. For one moment the heaven of [MASK] again grew black with supernatural terrors. Surely the man had a charmed life.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	43246	43223	43276	Syme	Anyhow, this was certain, that three times had a human sword been driven into him and made no mark. When [MASK] had that thought he drew himself up, and all that was good in him sang high up in the air as a high wind sings in the trees.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	43544	43507	43557	Syme	The train stopped. Suddenly, to the astonishment of everyone the Marquis sprang back quite out of sword reach and threw down his sword. The leap was wonderful, and not the less wonderful because [MASK] had plunged his sword a moment before into the man's thigh.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	43915	43915	43966	Syme	[MASK] had the feeling he had more than once had in these adventures the sense that a horrible and sublime wave lifted to heaven was just toppling over. Walking in a world he half understood, he took two paces forward and seized the Roman nose of this remarkable nobleman.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	44379	44354	44403	Syme	"You great silly, pink-faced, towheaded turnip! You " "You shall not go by this train," repeated [MASK]. "And why the infernal blazes," roared the other, "should I want to go by the train?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	44430	44427	44479	Jericho	"Going to [MASK] to throw a Jabberwock!" cried the other, tearing his hair, which came off easily. "Have you all got softening of the brain, that you don't realise what I am? Did you really think I wanted to catch that train?
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	44553	44544	44595	Syme	"I regret to inform you," said [MASK] with restraint, "that your remarks convey no impression to my mind. Perhaps if you were to remove the remains of your original forehead and some portion of what was once your chin, your meaning would become clearer.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	45472	45441	45494	Sunday	What can it mean?" "Mean!" said the new policeman with incredible violence. "It means that we are struck dead! Don't you know [MASK]? Don't you know that his jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought of them?
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	45502	45474	45528	Sunday	Don't you know that his jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought of them? Can you think of anything more like [MASK] than this, that he should put all his powerful enemies on the Supreme Council, and then take care that it was not supreme?
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	45702	45659	45708	Syme	And he was combining great masses of capital, and seizing great lines of telegraphy, while we five idiots were running after each other like a lot of confounded babies playing blind man's buff." "Well?" asked [MASK] with a sort of steadiness.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	45806	45806	45854	Syme	[MASK] uttered an involuntary cry, and they all turned their eyes towards the far-off station. It was quite true that a considerable bulk of people seemed to be moving in their direction. But they were too distant to be distinguished in any way.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	46019	45993	46039	Bull	"There are a good number of them certainly, but they may easily be ordinary tourists." "Do ordinary tourists," asked [MASK], with the fieldglasses to his eyes, "wear black masks half-way down the face?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	46040	46040	46090	Syme	[MASK] almost tore the glasses out of his hand, and looked through them. Most men in the advancing mob really looked ordinary enough; but it was quite true that two or three of the leaders in front wore black half-masks almost down to their mouths.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	46104	46091	46143	Syme	This disguise is very complete, especially at such a distance, and [MASK] found it impossible to conclude anything from the clean-shaven jaws and chins of the men talking in the front. But presently as they talked they all smiled and one of them smiled on one side.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	46209	46167	46215	Bull	"The President is not with them, anyhow," he said, and wiped his forehead. "But surely they are right away on the horizon," said the bewildered Colonel, blinking and but half recovered from [MASK]'s hasty though polite explanation.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	46823	46775	46829	Syme	The ex-Marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes, and the black shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the black half-masks of their pursuers. The fancy tinted [MASK]'s overwhelming sense of wonder.
TheManWhoWasThursday	59	47124	47081	47140	Syme	He had found the thing which the modern people call Impressionism, which is another name for that final scepticism which can find no floor to the universe. As a man in an evil dream strains himself to scream and wake, [MASK] strove with a sudden effort to fling off this last and worst of his fancies.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	47165	47141	47183	Ratcliffe	With two impatient strides he overtook the man in the Marquis's straw hat, the man whom he had come to address as [MASK]. In a voice exaggeratively loud and cheerful, he broke the bottomless silence and made conversation.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	47277	47266	47316	Syme	"What can you mean by all this?" cried [MASK]. "They can't be running the real world in that way. Surely not many working men are anarchists, and surely if they were, mere mobs could not beat modern armies and police."
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	47477	47447	47495	Syme	Aristocrats were always anarchists, as you can see from the barons' wars." "As a lecture on English history for the little ones," said [MASK], "this is all very nice; but I have not yet grasped its application."
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	47568	47524	47577	Syme	That is why he has got hold of all the communications; and that is why the last four champions of the anti-anarchist police force are running through a wood like rabbits." "Millionaires I can understand," said [MASK] thoughtfully, "they are nearly all mad.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	47616	47602	47652	Sunday	I would bet the nose off my face (forgive the allusion) that [MASK] would stand perfectly helpless before the task of converting any ordinary healthy person anywhere." "Well," said the other, "it rather depends what sort of person you mean."
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	47661	47633	47680	Syme	"Well," said the other, "it rather depends what sort of person you mean." "Well, for instance," said [MASK], "he could never convert that person," and he pointed straight in front of him.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	47696	47681	47730	Syme	They had come to an open space of sunlight, which seemed to express to [MASK] the final return of his own good sense; and in the middle of this forest clearing was a figure that might well stand for that common sense in an almost awful actuality.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	48011	48002	48050	Syme	"Oh, give him anything!" said [MASK] eagerly. "I have piles of money on me." "That will never do," said the Colonel; "he will never have any respect for you unless you drive a bargain."
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	48060	48014	48062	Bull	"I have piles of money on me." "That will never do," said the Colonel; "he will never have any respect for you unless you drive a bargain." "Oh, if he haggles!" began [MASK] impatiently.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	48377	48377	48432	Syme	[MASK] every now and then looked back over his shoulder at the army on their track. As the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distance, he could see the sunlit slopes beyond it and above it; and across these was still moving the square black mob like one monstrous beetle.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	48451	48433	48485	Syme	In the very strong sunlight and with his own very strong eyes, which were almost telescopic, [MASK] could see this mass of men quite plainly. He could see them as separate human figures; but he was increasingly surprised by the way in which they moved as one man.
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	48638	48599	48640	Syme	Yes, they are walking regularly; and you bet your boots that they are talking regularly, yes, and thinking regularly. But the one important thing for us is that they are disappearing regularly." [MASK] nodded.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	49135	49130	49181	Syme	"Horses!" repeated [MASK], looking up quickly. "Yes," replied the other; "if you people are really to distance your enemies it is horses or nothing for you, unless of course you have bicycles and motor-cars in your pocket."
TheManWhoWasThursday	56	49195	49141	49197	Syme	"Yes," replied the other; "if you people are really to distance your enemies it is horses or nothing for you, unless of course you have bicycles and motor-cars in your pocket." "And where do you advise us to make for?" asked [MASK] doubtfully.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	49369	49340	49386	Ducroix	Then he said "You are right," and then almost immediately afterwards, "Has anyone seen about the horses?" "Yes," answered [MASK], "you may be quite certain that I gave orders the moment I came in.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	50029	50006	50049	Bull	"He has a motor-car," said the Colonel. "But we may not get it," said [MASK]. "Yes, he is quite on your side." "But he might be out."

TheManWhoWasThursday	47	50499	50498	50545	Anarchy	"[MASK]," he said, shrugging his shoulders, "it is childishness!" "_Et a_," cried out the Colonel suddenly, pointing over the other's shoulder, "and that is childishness, isn't it?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	50571	50515	50572	Attila	"_Et a_," cried out the Colonel suddenly, pointing over the other's shoulder, "and that is childishness, isn't it?" They all looked round, and saw a curve of black cavalry come sweeping over the top of the hill with all the energy of [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	51039	51039	51090	Syme	[MASK]'s family, like most of those who end in the simple life, had once owned a motor, and he knew all about them. He had leapt at once into the chauffeur's seat, and with flushed face was wrenching and tugging at the disused machinery.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	51195	51178	51220	Syme	It was the Secretary, and his mouth went quite straight in the solemnity of triumph. [MASK] was leaning hard upon the steering wheel, and there was no sound but the rumble of the other pursuers riding into the town.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	51509	51486	51541	Renard	While our friend here was fighting with the steering wheel, I ran up the front steps of the house and spoke to [MASK], who was standing in his own porch, you will remember. 'I suppose,' I said, 'there's no time to get a lamp.'
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	51835	51833	51883	Bull	Then all [MASK]'s boiling good sense and optimism broke suddenly out of him. "Oh, this is all raving nonsense!" he cried. "If you really think that ordinary people in ordinary houses are anarchists, you must be madder than an anarchist yourself.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	52126	52117	52167	Ratcliffe	"He may have been forced," said [MASK] quietly. "The whole town is on their side." "You still believe that," asked the Colonel incredulously. "You will all believe it soon," said the other with a hopeless calm.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	52245	52199	52254	Syme	The plain people of a peaceable French town " He was cut short by a bang and a blaze of light, which seemed close to his eyes. As the car sped on it left a floating patch of white smoke behind it, and [MASK] had heard a shot shriek past his ear.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	52350	52311	52358	Syme	The staring Colonel was long past minding satire. He rolled his eyes all round the street. "It is extraordinary," he said, "most extraordinary." "A fastidious person," said [MASK], "might even call it unpleasant.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	52433	52399	52451	Bull	He had been standing up and looking keenly ahead of him. Now he sat down and smoothed his sleek hair with a weary gesture. "What do you mean?" asked [MASK] sharply. "I mean that we shall never get there," said the pessimist placidly.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	52499	52472	52521	Ratcliffe	The town is in arms, as I said it was. I can only wallow in the exquisite comfort of my own exactitude." And [MASK] sat down comfortably in the car and lit a cigarette, but the others rose excitedly and stared down the road.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	52658	52628	52681	Syme	But the rest of the street, especially the two ends of it, was in the deepest twilight, and for some seconds they could see nothing. Then [MASK], whose eyes were the keenest, broke into a little bitter whistle, and said, "It is quite true.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	52710	52682	52729	Bull	There is a crowd or an army or some such thing across the end of that street." "Well, if there is," said [MASK] impatiently, "it must be something else a sham fight or the mayor's birthday or something.
TheManWhoWasThursday	56	52858	52814	52870	Bull	That crowd's as law-abiding as a cow, and if it weren't, it's on our side." "How do you know?" asked the professor, staring. "You blind bat," cried [MASK], "don't you see who is leading them?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	53330	53289	53340	Sunday	I don't think, and I never shall think, that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern thinkers. No, sir, I'm a democrat, and I still don't believe that [MASK] could convert one average navvy or counter-jumper.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	53423	53373	53424	Renard	"You are a very fine fellow," he said. "You can believe in a sanity which is not merely your sanity. And you're right enough about humanity, about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper. But you're not right about [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	53640	53623	53671	Renard	"I tell you it can't be!" cried the Colonel, stamping. "[MASK] shall explain it. He shall explain it to me," and he strode forward. "Don't be in such a hurry," drawled the smoker.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	53771	53743	53791	Bull	He will never get anything out of that old heathen. I vote we drive bang through the thick of them, bang as the bullets went through [MASK]'s hat. We may all be killed, but we must kill a tidy number of them."
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	53850	53815	53864	Ratcliffe	"The poor chaps may be making a mistake. Give the Colonel a chance." "Shall we go back, then?" asked the Professor. "No," said [MASK] in a cold voice, "the street behind us is held too.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	54125	54118	54160	Syme	"At this moment," said [MASK], with a scientific detachment, "I think we are going to smash into a lamppost." The next instant the automobile had come with a catastrophic jar against an iron object.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	54244	54211	54254	Syme	"Well, we smashed something," said the Professor, with a faint smile. "That's some comfort." "You're becoming an anarchist," said [MASK], dusting his clothes with his instinct of daintiness.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	54261	54255	54298	Ratcliffe	"Everyone is," said [MASK]. As they spoke, the white-haired horseman and his followers came thundering from above, and almost at the same moment a dark string of men ran shouting along the sea-front.
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	54444	54391	54448	Horatius	"Whatever all this pandemonium means, I suppose the police station will help us. We can't get there, for they hold the way. But there's a pier or breakwater runs out into the sea just here, which we could defend longer than anything else, like [MASK] and his bridge.
TheManWhoWasThursday	59	54724	54693	54752	Syme	The example was followed, and the whole black mass of men began to run and drip over the edge like black treacle. Foremost among the men on the beach [MASK] saw the peasant who had driven their cart. He splashed into the surf on a huge cart-horse, and shook his axe at them.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	54759	54734	54779	Syme	He splashed into the surf on a huge cart-horse, and shook his axe at them. "The peasant!" cried [MASK]. "They have not risen since the Middle Ages." "Even if the police do come now
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	54802	54797	54845	Bull	"Nonsense!" said [MASK] desperately; "there must be some people left in the town who are human." "No," said the hopeless Inspector, "the human being will soon be extinct. We are the last of mankind."
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	54943	54937	54983	Bull	" "Stop!" cried [MASK] suddenly, "the gendarmes are out." The low lights of the police station were indeed blotted and broken with hurrying figures, and they heard through the darkness the clash and jingle of a disciplined cavalry.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	54993	54953	54998	Bull	The low lights of the police station were indeed blotted and broken with hurrying figures, and they heard through the darkness the clash and jingle of a disciplined cavalry. "They are charging the mob!" cried [MASK] in ecstacy or alarm.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	55034	55029	55072	Ratcliffe	"Yes," said [MASK], "and they are going to fire on us." As he spoke there came a long crackle of musketry, and bullets seemed to hop like hailstones on the stones in front of them.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	55100	55047	55102	Bull	As he spoke there came a long crackle of musketry, and bullets seemed to hop like hailstones on the stones in front of them. "The gendarmes have joined them!" cried the Professor, and struck his forehead. "I am in the padded cell," said [MASK] solidly.
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	55111	55103	55147	Ratcliffe	There was a long silence, and then [MASK] said, looking out over the swollen sea, all a sort of grey purple "What does it matter who is mad or who is sane? We shall all be dead soon."
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	55241	55187	55244	Syme	There is one insane little hope that I cannot get out of my mind. The power of this whole planet is against us, yet I cannot help wondering whether this one silly little hope is hopeless yet." "In what or whom is your hope?" asked [MASK] with curiosity.
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	55273	55245	55286	Syme	"In a man I never saw," said the other, looking at the leaden sea. "I know what you mean," said [MASK] in a low voice, "the man in the dark room.
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	55317	55297	55341	Sunday	"Perhaps," said the other steadily; "but if so, he was the only man whom [MASK] found it hard to kill." "I heard what you said," said the Professor, with his back turned.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	55488	55476	55525	Syme	He is " "No! no! no!" cried [MASK] in a kind of frenzy, "not the Colonel too! I will never believe it!" "Will you believe your eyes?" asked the other, and pointed to the beach.
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	55876	55867	55908	Syme	"Do you see this lantern?" cried [MASK] in a terrible voice. "Do you see the cross carved on it, and the flame inside? You did not make it. You did not light it.
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	56069	56023	56080	Syme	He struck the Secretary once with the lantern so that he staggered; and then, whirling it twice round his head, sent it flying far out to sea, where it flared like a roaring rocket and fell. "Swords!" shouted [MASK], turning his flaming face to the three behind him.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	56107	56081	56128	Syme	"Let us charge these dogs, for our time has come to die." His three companions came after him sword in hand. [MASK]'s sword was broken, but he rent a bludgeon from the fist of a fisherman, flinging him down.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	56156	56129	56181	Syme	In a moment they would have flung themselves upon the face of the mob and perished, when an interruption came. The Secretary, ever since [MASK]'s speech, had stood with his hand to his stricken head as if dazed; now he suddenly pulled off his black mask.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	56583	56583	56629	Syme	[MASK] had to explain how they had fled with such swiftness through a civilised country. But above all these matters of detail which could be explained, rose the central mountain of the matter that they could not explain. What did it all mean?
TheManWhoWasThursday	58	56639	56599	56657	Sunday	But above all these matters of detail which could be explained, rose the central mountain of the matter that they could not explain. What did it all mean? If they were all harmless officers, what was [MASK]? If he had not seized the world, what on earth had he been up to?
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	56721	56707	56760	Syme	do you remember his face?" "I grant you," answered [MASK], "that I have never been able to forget it." "Well," said the Secretary, "I suppose we can find out soon, for tomorrow we have our next general meeting.
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	56823	56800	56844	Sunday	"I suppose we might find it out from him; but I confess that I should feel a bit afraid of asking [MASK] who he really is." "Why," asked the Secretary, "for fear of bombs?"
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	57044	57026	57067	Syme	Twenty minutes afterwards, however, he came back and made quite a clamour in the hall. [MASK], who tried at first to soothe him, was forced at last to listen to his communication with quite new attention.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	57849	57815	57866	Sunday	Are you a half-witted man playing the conspirator, or are you a clever man playing the fool? Answer me, I tell you." "Candidates," murmured [MASK], "are only required to answer eight out of the seventeen questions on the paper.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	57956	57950	57999	Syme	"And you," said [MASK], leaning forward, "what are you?" "I? What am I?" roared the President, and he rose slowly to an incredible height, like some enormous wave about to arch above them and break.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	58012	57970	58020	Bull	What am I?" roared the President, and he rose slowly to an incredible height, like some enormous wave about to arch above them and break. "You want to know what I am, do you? [MASK], you are a man of science.
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	58036	58021	58078	Syme	Grub in the roots of those trees and find out the truth about them. [MASK], you are a poet. Stare at those morning clouds. But I tell you this, that you will have found out the truth of the last tree and the top-most cloud before the truth about me.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	58334	58309	58360	Syme	The six detectives had been standing thunderstruck and livid in the light of his last assertion; but when he disappeared into the cab, [MASK]'s practical senses returned to him, and leaping over the balcony so recklessly as almost to break his legs, he called another cab.
TheManWhoWasThursday	58	58646	58630	58688	Sunday	Shops and streets shot by like rattling arrows. At the highest ecstacy of speed, [MASK] turned round on the splashboard where he stood, and sticking his great grinning head out of the cab, with white hair whistling in the wind, he made a horrible face at his pursuers, like some colossal urchin.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	58824	58824	58878	Syme	[MASK]'s message was, at any rate, longer, and ran as follows: "No one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by the Archdeacon more than I. I trust it will not come to that. But, for the last time, where are your goloshes?
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	58982	58975	59024	Sunday	But quick as it went by, [MASK] had bounded out of his cab, sprung at the fire-engine, caught it, slung himself on to it, and was seen as he disappeared in the noisy distance talking to the astonished fireman with explanatory gestures.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	59031	59030	59078	Syme	howled [MASK]. "He can't go astray now. There's no mistaking a fire-engine." The three cabmen, who had been stunned for a moment, whipped up their horses and slightly decreased the distance between themselves and their disappearing prey.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	59263	59263	59309	Syme	[MASK] with a furious gesture stopped his cab, jumped out, and sprang also to the escalade. When he had one leg over the fence and his friends were following, he turned a face on them which shone quite pale in the shadow.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	59381	59370	59419	Syme	"No, but it isn't that," said [MASK], knitting his brows. "I hear the most horrible noises, like devils laughing and sneezing and blowing their devilish noses!" "His dogs barking, of course," said the Secretary.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	59432	59387	59438	Syme	"I hear the most horrible noises, like devils laughing and sneezing and blowing their devilish noses!" "His dogs barking, of course," said the Secretary. "Why not say his black-beetles barking!" said [MASK] furiously, "snails barking!
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	59727	59679	59728	Syme	As they were looking round wildly for any trace of their wild quarry, a keeper in uniform came running along the path with a man in plain clothes. "Has it come this way?" gasped the keeper. "Has what?" asked [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	59785	59739	59790	Syme	An elephant has gone mad and run away!" "He has run away with an old gentleman," said the other stranger breathlessly, "a poor old gentleman with white hair!" "What sort of old gentleman?" asked [MASK], with great curiosity.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	59815	59810	59862	Syme	"Well," said [MASK], "if he's that particular kind of old gentleman, if you're quite sure that he's a large and fat old gentleman in grey clothes, you may take my word for it that the elephant has not run away with him.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	60139	60105	60154	Syme	Well, it must be hansom-cabs again if we are to keep him in sight." As they raced along to the gate out of which the elephant had vanished, [MASK] felt a glaring panorama of the strange animals in the cages which they passed.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	60247	60209	60254	Nature	He remembered a hornbill, which was simply a huge yellow beak with a small bird tied on behind it. The whole gave him a sensation, the vividness of which he could not explain, that [MASK] was always making quite mysterious jokes.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	60389	60373	60427	Gogol	But at their rate of racing it fell far behind, just by the cab containing [MASK]; and in faint hope of a clue or for some impulse unexplainable, he stopped his cab so as to pick it up. It was addressed to himself, and was quite a bulky parcel.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	60758	60715	60764	Syme	In front of them was an enormous crowd; in the midst of it was an enormous elephant, heaving and shuddering as such shapeless creatures do. But the President had disappeared. "Where has he gone to?" asked [MASK], slipping to the ground.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	60918	60876	60926	Syme	Rustic Proverb." "Why the eternal crikey," began the Secretary, "did you let the man in? Do people commonly come to your Exhibition riding on mad elephants? Do " "Look!" shouted [MASK] suddenly. "Look over there!"
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	60947	60921	60971	Syme	"Look over there!" "Look at what?" asked the Secretary savagely. "Look at the captive balloon!" said [MASK], and pointed in a frenzy. "Why the blazes should I look at a captive balloon?" demanded the Secretary.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	60988	60955	60998	Syme	"Why the blazes should I look at a captive balloon?" demanded the Secretary. "What is there queer about a captive balloon?" "Nothing," said [MASK], "except that it isn't captive!"
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	61224	61215	61256	Syme	" There was a short silence, and then [MASK] said, biting his beard "I'm not beaten yet. The blasted thing must come down somewhere. Let's follow it!" CHAPTER XIV. THE SIX PHILOSOPHERS
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	61810	61772	61823	Bull	Shall I make it clear if I say that I liked him because he was so fat?" "You will not," said the Secretary. "I've got it now," cried [MASK], "it was because he was so fat and so light.
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	61897	61868	61912	Syme	It was like the old speculations what would happen if an elephant could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper?" "Our elephant," said [MASK], looking upwards, "has leapt into the sky like a grasshopper."
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	62181	62157	62203	Sunday	But there must have been something in me that answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men. For when I first saw [MASK] he expressed to me, not your airy vitality, but something both gross and sad in the Nature of Things.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	62516	62496	62548	Sunday	He talked to me in an ordinary way. But I'll tell you what is a trifle creepy about [MASK]. His room is neat, his clothes are neat, everything seems in order; but he's absent-minded. Sometimes his great bright eyes go quite blind.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	62775	62763	62805	Syme	"Well, that is a point of view," said [MASK] thoughtfully. "What do you say, Professor?" The Professor was walking with bent head and trailing stick, and he did not answer at all.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	62824	62817	62866	Sunday	"Tell us what you think of [MASK]." The Professor spoke at last very slowly. "I think something," he said, "that I cannot say clearly. Or, rather, I think something that I cannot even think clearly.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	62897	62867	62917	Sunday	But it is something like this. My early life, as you know, was a bit too large and loose." "Well, when I saw [MASK]'s face I thought it was too large everybody does, but I also thought it was too loose.
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	63083	63046	63103	Sunday	Yet when I walked a little farther I found that there was no face, that the window was ten yards away, the lamp ten hundred yards, the cloud beyond the world. Well, [MASK]'s face escaped me; it ran away to right and left, as such chance pictures run away.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	63129	63104	63156	Bull	And so his face has made me, somehow, doubt whether there are any faces. I don't know whether your face, [MASK], is a face or a combination in perspective. Perhaps one black disc of your beastly glasses is quite close and another fifty miles away.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	63170	63157	63206	Sunday	Oh, the doubts of a materialist are not worth a dump. [MASK] has taught me the last and the worst doubts, the doubts of a spiritualist. I am a Buddhist, I suppose; and Buddhism is not a creed, it is a doubt.
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	63210	63187	63233	Bull	I am a Buddhist, I suppose; and Buddhism is not a creed, it is a doubt. My poor dear [MASK], I do not believe that you really have a face. I have not faith enough to believe in matter."
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	63234	63234	63279	Syme	[MASK]'s eyes were still fixed upon the errant orb, which, reddened in the evening light, looked like some rosier and more innocent world. "Have you noticed an odd thing," he said, "about all your descriptions?
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	63285	63262	63306	Sunday	"Have you noticed an odd thing," he said, "about all your descriptions? Each man of you finds [MASK] quite different, yet each man of you can only find one thing to compare him to the universe itself.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	63381	63342	63390	Sunday	The Professor says he is like a changing landscape. This is queer, but it is queerer still that I also have had my odd notion about the President, and I also find that I think of [MASK] as I think of the whole world."
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	63608	63587	63637	Syme	On the contrary, it frightened me because it was so beautiful, because it was so good." "[MASK]," exclaimed the Secretary, "are you ill?" "It was like the face of some ancient archangel, judging justly after heroic wars.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	63706	63675	63722	Pan	But when I saw him from behind I was certain he was an animal, and when I saw him in front I knew he was a god." "[MASK]," said the Professor dreamily, "was a god and an animal."
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	63734	63723	63780	Syme	"Then, and again and always," went on [MASK] like a man talking to himself, "that has been for me the mystery of Sunday, and it is also the mystery of the world. When I see the horrible back, I am sure the noble face is but a mask.
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	63843	63800	63857	Sunday	Bad is so bad, that we cannot but think good an accident; good is so good, that we feel certain that evil could be explained. But the whole came to a kind of crest yesterday when I raced [MASK] for the cab, and was just behind him all the way."
TheManWhoWasThursday	41	63875	63870	63911	Syme	"Time," replied [MASK], "for one outrageous thought. I was suddenly possessed with the idea that the blind, blank back of his head really was his face an awful, eyeless face staring at me!
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	64039	64032	64079	Syme	"Listen to me," cried [MASK] with extraordinary emphasis. "Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world? It is that we have only known the back of the world. We see everything from behind, and it looks brutal.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	64134	64093	64144	Bull	That is not a cloud, but the back of a cloud. Cannot you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face? If we could only get round in front " "Look!" cried out [MASK] clamorously, "the balloon is coming down!"
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	64153	64145	64190	Syme	There was no need to cry out to [MASK], who had never taken his eyes off it. He saw the great luminous globe suddenly stagger in the sky, right itself, and then sink slowly behind the trees like a setting sun.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	64194	64164	64215	Gogol	He saw the great luminous globe suddenly stagger in the sky, right itself, and then sink slowly behind the trees like a setting sun. The man called [MASK], who had hardly spoken through all their weary travels, suddenly threw up his hands like a lost spirit.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	64369	64343	64390	Syme	He means everything." "Don't forget," said the Secretary, looking down, "that he also means Panic." [MASK] had stood without hearing any of the exclamations. "It fell over there," he said shortly. "
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	65007	64999	65044	Syme	"I don't know," said [MASK] as he sank wearily back in the cushions of his carriage; "but if it is, it's one of the jokes you talk about. It's a good-natured one."
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	65147	65147	65202	Syme	[MASK] drove through a drifting darkness of trees in utter abandonment. It was typical of him that while he had carried his bearded chin forward fiercely so long as anything could be done, when the whole business was taken out of his hands he fell back on the cushions in a frank collapse.
TheManWhoWasThursday	59	65494	65446	65505	Syme	When the carriages eventually rolled up to a large, low, cavernous gateway, another man in the same uniform, but wearing a silver star on the grey breast of his coat, came out to meet them. This impressive person said to the bewildered [MASK] "Refreshments are provided for you in your room."
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	65680	65675	65719	Syme	"Clothes!" said [MASK] sardonically. "I have no clothes except these," and he lifted two long strips of his frock-coat in fascinating festoons, and made a movement as if to twirl like a ballet girl.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	65801	65759	65812	Syme	Meanwhile, sir, there is a bottle of Burgundy and some cold pheasant, which he hopes you will not refuse, as it is some hours before supper." "Cold pheasant is a good thing," said [MASK] reflectively, "and Burgundy is a spanking good thing.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	65983	65931	65986	Syme	"It doesn't sound a warm costume." "Oh, yes, sir," said the other eagerly, "the Thursday costume is quite warm, sir. It fastens up to the chin." "Well, I don't understand anything," said [MASK], sighing.
TheManWhoWasThursday	50	66018	66004	66054	Thursday	Still, I may be allowed to ask why I should be particularly like [MASK] in a green frock spotted all over with the sun and moon. Those orbs, I think, shine on other days. I once saw the moon on Tuesday, I remember."
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	66093	66043	66097	Syme	I once saw the moon on Tuesday, I remember." "Beg pardon, sir," said the valet, "Bible also provided for you," and with a respectful and rigid finger he pointed out a passage in the first chapter of Genesis. [MASK] read it wondering.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	66141	66098	66150	Syme	It was that in which the fourth day of the week is associated with the creation of the sun and moon. Here, however, they reckoned from a Christian Sunday. "This is getting wilder and wilder," said [MASK], as he sat down in a chair.
TheManWhoWasThursday	42	66388	66373	66415	Syme	The whole looked like some very severe ecclesiastical vestment. There was no need for [MASK] to search his memory or the Bible in order to remember that the first day of creation marked the mere creation of light out of darkness.
TheManWhoWasThursday	43	66479	66479	66522	Syme	[MASK] was scarcely surprised to notice that, amid all the ease and hospitality of their new surroundings, this man's eyes were still stern. No smell of ale or orchards could make the Secretary cease to ask a reasonable question.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	66524	66506	66553	Syme	No smell of ale or orchards could make the Secretary cease to ask a reasonable question. If [MASK] had been able to see himself, he would have realised that he, too, seemed to be for the first time himself and no one else.
TheManWhoWasThursday	57	66570	66554	66611	Syme	For if the Secretary stood for that philosopher who loves the original and formless light, [MASK] was a type of the poet who seeks always to make the light in special shapes, to split it up into sun and star. The philosopher may sometimes love the infinite; the poet always loves the finite.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	66642	66612	66666	Ratcliffe	For him the great moment is not the creation of light, but the creation of the sun and moon. As they descended the broad stairs together they overtook [MASK], who was clad in spring green like a huntsman, and the pattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees.
TheManWhoWasThursday	54	66744	66703	66757	Syme	They were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very large old English garden, full of torches and bonfires, by the broken light of which a vast carnival of people were dancing in motley dress. [MASK] seemed to see every shape in Nature imitated in some crazy costume.
TheManWhoWasThursday	51	66800	66800	66851	Syme	[MASK] even saw, with a queer thrill, one dancer dressed like an enormous hornbill, with a beak twice as big as himself the queer bird which had fixed itself on his fancy like a living question while he was rushing down the long road at the Zoological Gardens.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	67242	67204	67256	Syme	Cups were clashed and torches shaken, and feathered hats flung in the air. The men for whom these thrones were reserved were men crowned with some extraordinary laurels. But the central chair was empty. [MASK] was on the left hand of it and the Secretary on the right.
TheManWhoWasThursday	44	67324	67323	67367	Sunday	But [MASK] had only passed silently along the front like a shadow, and had sat in the central seat. He was draped plainly, in a pure and terrible white, and his hair was like a silver flame on his forehead.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	67710	67675	67728	Sunday	Not one of them had spoken a word. They seemed in no haste to do so, but heard in silence the hum of insects and the distant song of one bird. Then [MASK] spoke, but so dreamily that he might have been continuing a conversation rather than beginning one.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	67900	67866	67918	Syme	The sun in heaven denied it, the earth and sky denied it, all human wisdom denied it. And when I met you in the daylight I denied it myself." [MASK] stirred sharply in his seat, but otherwise there was silence, and the incomprehensible went on.
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	68010	67986	68038	Sunday	There was complete silence in the starlit garden, and then the black-browed Secretary, implacable, turned in his chair towards [MASK], and said in a harsh voice "Who and what are you?" "I am the Sabbath," said the other without moving.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	68127	68106	68154	Sunday	Well, I am not reconciled. If you were the man in the dark room, why were you also [MASK], an offense to the sunlight? If you were from the first our father and our friend, why were you also our greatest enemy?
TheManWhoWasThursday	46	68229	68224	68270	Syme	"No," said [MASK], "I do not feel fierce like that. I am grateful to you, not only for wine and hospitality here, but for many a fine scamper and free fight. But I should like to know.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	68330	68330	68375	Bull	[MASK] said "I understand nothing, but I am happy. In fact, I am going to sleep." "I am not happy," said the Professor with his head in his hands, "because I do not understand.
TheManWhoWasThursday	48	68761	68739	68787	Syme	I would destroy the world if I could." A sense of a pathos far under the earth stirred up in [MASK], and he spoke brokenly and without sequence. "Oh, most unhappy man," he cried, "try to be happy!
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	68814	68797	68846	Gregory	"My red hair, like red flames, shall burn up the world," said [MASK]. "I thought I hated everything more than common men can hate anything; but I find that I do not hate everything so much as I hate you!"
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	68855	68816	68869	Syme	"I thought I hated everything more than common men can hate anything; but I find that I do not hate everything so much as I hate you!" "I never hated you," said [MASK] very sadly. Then out of this unintelligible creature the last thunders broke.
TheManWhoWasThursday	45	69099	69065	69110	Syme	Oh, I could forgive you everything, you that rule all mankind, if I could feel for once that you had suffered for one hour a real agony such as I " [MASK] sprang to his feet, shaking from head to foot.
TheManWhoWasThursday	58	69237	69212	69270	Satan	So that each man fighting for order may be as brave and good a man as the dynamiter. So that the real lie of [MASK] may be flung back in the face of this blasphemer, so that by tears and torture we may earn the right to say to this man, 'You lie!'
TheManWhoWasThursday	52	69401	69356	69408	Sunday	I repel the slander; we have not been happy. I can answer for every one of the great guards of Law whom he has accused. At least " He had turned his eyes so as to see suddenly the great face of [MASK], which wore a strange smile.
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	69448	69409	69458	Memnon	"Have you," he cried in a dreadful voice, "have you ever suffered?" As he gazed, the great face grew to an awful size, grew larger than the colossal mask of [MASK], which had made him scream as a child.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	69599	69584	69639	Sunday	For while he could always remember afterwards that he had swooned before the face of [MASK], he could not remember having ever come to at all. He could only remember that gradually and naturally he knew that he was and had been walking along a country lane with an easy and conversational companion.
TheManWhoWasThursday	47	69658	69612	69659	Gregory	He could only remember that gradually and naturally he knew that he was and had been walking along a country lane with an easy and conversational companion. That companion had been a part of his recent drama; it was the red-haired poet [MASK].
TheManWhoWasThursday	49	69680	69660	69709	Syme	They were walking like old friends, and were in the middle of a conversation about some triviality. But [MASK] could only feel an unnatural buoyancy in his body and a crystal simplicity in his mind that seemed to be superior to everything that he said or did.
TheManWhoWasThursday	53	69750	69710	69763	Nature	He felt he was in possession of some impossible good news, which made every other thing a triviality, but an adorable triviality. Dawn was breaking over everything in colours at once clear and timid; as if [MASK] made a first attempt at yellow and a first attempt at rose.
TheManWhoWasThursday	55	69864	69833	69888	Gregory	He walked by instinct along one white road, on which early birds hopped and sang, and found himself outside a fenced garden. There he saw the sister of [MASK], the girl with the gold-red hair, cutting lilac before breakfast, with the great unconscious gravity of a girl.
