TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	62	39	91	Poirot	Nevertheless, in view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both by my friend [MASK] and the family themselves, to write an account of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	509	469	519	Lawrence	Their step-mother, however, had always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the time of their father's remarriage that they always thought of her as their own mother. [MASK], the younger, had been a delicate youth.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	552	520	575	John	He had qualified as a doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any marked success. [MASK] practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled down to the more congenial life of a country squire.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	801	778	827	Evie	"Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of [MASK]'s, though she didn't seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an absolute outsider, anyone can see that.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	921	874	924	Alfred	"Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No doubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced that she and [MASK] were engaged!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	1335	1325	1375	Cynthia	That's not your wife?" "No, [MASK] is a prot g e of my mother's, the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	1947	1910	1965	John	An appreciative listener is always stimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents of my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly amused my hostess. [MASK], of course, good fellow though he is, could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	2089	2077	2127	Alfred	After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful, [MASK] dear." The French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome white-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features, stepped out of it on to the lawn.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	2204	2191	2239	John	He certainly struck a rather alien note. I did not wonder at [MASK] objecting to his beard. It was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore gold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	3133	3125	3172	John	She flung herself down on the ground beside [MASK], and as I handed her a plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me. "Sit down here on the grass, do. It's ever so much nicer." I dropped down obediently.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	3220	3187	3238	Cynthia	She nodded. "For my sins." "Do they bully you, then?" I asked, smiling. "I should like to see them!" cried [MASK] with dignity. "I have got a cousin who is nursing," I remarked. "
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	3309	3273	3321	Cynthia	You've no idea! But I'm not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the dispensary." "How many people do you poison?" I asked, smiling. [MASK] smiled too. "Oh, hundreds!" she said.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	3492	3486	3533	John	I expressed my appreciation, and [MASK] took me into the house and up the broad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different wings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out over the park.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	42	3967	3957	3999	Emily	"True enough! Afraid I said some things to [MASK] she won't forget or forgive in a hurry. Don't mind if they've only sunk in a bit. Probably water off a duck's back, though.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	4011	4000	4047	Emily	I said right out: You're an old woman, [MASK], and there's no fool like an old fool. The man's twenty years younger than you, and don't you fool yourself as to what he married you for. Money!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	4328	4326	4379	Emily	My poor [MASK]. They're a lot of sharks all of them. Oh, I know what I'm talking about. There isn't one of them that's not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I've protected her as much as I could.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	4823	4781	4827	John	As we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and smiled. "That's a pretty girl," I remarked appreciatively. [MASK]'s face hardened.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	5005	5004	5052	Lawrence	"[MASK]? He's gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings. No, we're an impecunious lot. My mother's always been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	5439	5400	5452	John	We were all busy during the morning arranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take place. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the garden. I noticed that [MASK]'s manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed very excited and restless.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	5550	5543	5586	Cynthia	There were also some tableaux in which [MASK] took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a supper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been acting with her in the tableaux.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	5848	5809	5860	Cynthia	"What a lot of bottles!" I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the small room. "Do you really know what's in them all?" "Say something original," groaned [MASK]. "Every single person who comes up here says that.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	5962	5916	5968	Lawrence	"If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by mistake, you wouldn't joke about it. Come on, let's have tea. We've got all sorts of secret stores in that cupboard. No, [MASK] that's the poison cupboard.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	6195	6173	6214	Cynthia	"Don't you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?" "Well," said [MASK] graciously, "we are very busy, but if we have time it shall be done."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	6221	6215	6263	Cynthia	The little nurse withdrew, and [MASK] promptly took a jar from the shelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the door. I laughed. "Discipline must be maintained?" "Exactly. Come out on our little balcony.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	45	6276	6244	6289	Cynthia	I laughed. "Discipline must be maintained?" "Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside wards there." I followed [MASK] and her friend and they pointed out the different wards to me.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	56	6428	6390	6446	Cynthia	Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied that, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for him. I had always fancied that his manner to [MASK] was rather constrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	6705	6659	6712	Poirot	Then, as I looked at him inquiringly: "Yes, my friend, she had kindly extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are refugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her with gratitude." [MASK] was an extraordinary looking little man.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	6887	6849	6893	Cynthia	He pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow Belgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he raised his hat with a flourish to [MASK], and we drove away.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	57	7027	7023	7080	Dorcas	Then catching sight of [MASK], the parlourmaid, going into the dining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir. "Yes, m'm." The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: "Don't you think, m'm, you'd better get to bed?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	7094	7081	7131	Dorcas	You're looking very tired." "Perhaps you're right, [MASK] yes no not now. I've some letters I must finish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told you?" "Yes, m'm."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	7152	7112	7160	Cynthia	Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told you?" "Yes, m'm." "Then I'll go to bed directly after supper." She went into the boudoir again, and [MASK] stared after her. "Goodness gracious!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	7533	7519	7573	Dorcas	I do hope she's found him out at last!" "Was [MASK] there, then?" "Of course not. She happened to be near the door'. It was a real old bust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	7632	7625	7678	John	I was anxious to get hold of [MASK], but he was nowhere to be seen. Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried to forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could not dismiss them altogether from my mind.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	7744	7728	7777	Inglethorp	She still looked agitated, and during the meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. [MASK] was unusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little attentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the part of the devoted husband.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	8598	8566	8612	Lawrence	Unfortunately she has locked herself in." "I'll come at once." I sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed [MASK] along the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	8779	8773	8822	Lawrence	It was pitch dark, but [MASK] was following with the candle, and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and that there was no sign of the room having been occupied. We went straight to the connecting door.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	8850	8835	8885	Dorcas	What was to be done? "Oh, dear, sir," cried [MASK], wringing her hands, "what ever shall we do?" "We must try and break the door in, I suppose. It'll be a tough job, though.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	9200	9179	9229	Lawrence	Then he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave on the corridor. I turned to [MASK], to suggest that I had better leave them now that there was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on my lips.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	10030	10027	10076	John	He turned to [MASK]. "You do not object?" "Certainly not." We all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone, and I heard the key turned in the lock behind us. We went slowly down the stairs.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	10713	10703	10756	John	Yet I was a little chary of doing so. [MASK], I knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing optimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be difficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	10757	10743	10798	Lawrence	It might be difficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. [MASK], on the other hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I felt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment had come for me to take the lead.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	10828	10816	10864	Poirot	"Well?" "You remember my speaking of my friend [MASK]? The Belgian who is here? He has been a most famous detective." "Yes." "I want you to let me call him in to investigate this matter."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	10897	10849	10899	Lawrence	"I want you to let me call him in to investigate this matter." "What now? Before the post-mortem?" "Yes, time is an advantage if if there has been foul play." "Rubbish!" cried [MASK] angrily.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	11008	11002	11049	Hastings	"I'm inclined to give [MASK] a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We don't want any unnecessary scandal." "No, no," I cried eagerly, "you need have no fear of that.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	11050	11022	11074	Poirot	We don't want any unnecessary scandal." "No, no," I cried eagerly, "you need have no fear of that. [MASK] is discretion itself." "Very well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	11282	11238	11288	Denby	How did he intend to explain his absence? He accosted me eagerly. "My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard." "Where have you been?" I asked. "[MASK] kept me late last night.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	11322	11289	11340	Denby	It was one o'clock before we'd finished. Then I found that I'd forgotten the latch-key after all. I didn't want to arouse the household, so [MASK] gave me a bed." "How did you hear the news?" I asked.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	11655	11625	11671	Poirot	I was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times, and occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten. [MASK] smiled kindly on me. "The mind is confused? Is it not so?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	11793	11756	11808	Poirot	"That's all very well," I objected, "but how are you going to decide what is important, and what isn't? That always seems the difficulty to me." [MASK] shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache with exquisite care.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	11814	11799	11850	Voyons	He was now arranging his moustache with exquisite care. "Not so. _[MASK]!_ One fact leads to another so we continue. Does the next fit in with that? _A merveille!_ Good! We can proceed. This next little fact no!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	11926	11899	11949	Poirot	He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. "It is significant! It is tremendous!" "Y es " "Ah!" [MASK] shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed before it. "Beware! Peril to the detective who says:
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	12226	12202	12254	Poirot	She was obviously upset, and it had taken her appetite away. That was only natural." "Yes," said [MASK] thoughtfully, "it was only natural." He opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to me.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	12338	12310	12359	Poirot	"_ a y est!_ Now, shall we start?" We hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. [MASK] stopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse of park, still glittering with morning dew.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	12462	12422	12474	Poirot	I realized that there was an emotional lack in the atmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her death was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately regretted. [MASK] seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	12824	12790	12837	John	Now that is a curious circumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain it. In the meantime, remember it." As we neared the house, [MASK] came out and met us. His face looked weary and haggard.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	12854	12853	12904	Hastings	"[MASK] has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?" "I comprehend perfectly." "You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon." "Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	12905	12874	12925	John	"You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon." "Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only." [MASK] turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a cigarette as he did so.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	13057	13057	13105	Poirot	[MASK] nodded thoughtfully. "Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us." We went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in it.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	13109	13077	13126	Poirot	We went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in it. [Illustration] [MASK] locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute inspection of the room.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	13154	13142	13191	Poirot	I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate any clues. [MASK], however, did not seem grateful to me for my forbearance. "What have you, my friend," he cried, "that you remain there like how do you say it?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	13708	13671	13723	Poirot	A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys, and the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about. "Ah, this is curious," said [MASK]. "I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	14588	14542	14590	Poirot	To which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to use my own natural faculties. "And the sixth point?" I asked. "I suppose it is the sample of cocoa." "No," said [MASK] thoughtfully.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	14714	14664	14716	Hastings	But by chance there might be let us see!" Deftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate into the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he gave a faint exclamation. "The forceps, [MASK]!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	14795	14771	14821	Poirot	[Illustration] I was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper. Suddenly an idea struck me. "[MASK]!" I cried. "This is a fragment of a will!" "Exactly." I looked up at him sharply.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	14930	14886	14937	Poirot	Who had destroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor? Obviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been bolted on the inside. "Now, my friend," said [MASK] briskly, "we will go.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	15042	15041	15090	Poirot	"[MASK]," I cried, "where are you?" "I am here, my friend." He had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently lost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds. "Admirable!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	15151	15113	15164	Dorcas	The spacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is it not so?" "Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in [MASK] is here." "_Eh bien, eh bien!_
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	42	15251	15251	15293	Dorcas	[MASK] was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her, and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	15298	15279	15320	Poirot	She was the very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant. In her attitude towards [MASK], she was inclined to be suspicious, but he soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	15326	15321	15370	mademoiselle	"Pray be seated, [MASK]." "Thank you, sir." "You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?" "Ten years, sir." "That is a long time, and very faithful service.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	15465	15421	15467	Dorcas	"Oh, certainly, sir." "Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday afternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?" "Yes, sir. But I don't know that I ought " [MASK] hesitated.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	15477	15474	15528	Dorcas	"My good [MASK], it is necessary that I should know every detail of that quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying your mistress's secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary that we should know all if we are to avenge her.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	15564	15557	15605	Dorcas	"Amen to that," said [MASK] fiercely. "And, naming no names, there's _one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it was when first _he_ darkened the threshold."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	15606	15590	15644	Poirot	And an ill day it was when first _he_ darkened the threshold." [MASK] waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his business-like tone, he asked: "Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	16003	15994	16043	Dorcas	She was looking dreadful so white and upset. [MASK],' she says, I've had a great shock.' I'm sorry for that, m'm,' I says. You'll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea, m'm.'
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	16129	16117	16168	Dorcas	And then she says to me: Never trust a man, [MASK], they're not worth it!' I hurried off, and got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said she'd feel better when she'd drunk it.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	16191	16138	16192	Dorcas	I hurried off, and got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said she'd feel better when she'd drunk it. I don't know what to do,' she says. Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, [MASK].
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	16373	16346	16398	Dorcas	She was very much put out about it." "But she had a duplicate key?" "Oh, yes, sir." [MASK] was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was I. What was all this about a lost key?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	16406	16402	16445	Dorcas	"Never mind, [MASK], it is my business to know things. Is this the key that was lost?" He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in the lock of the despatch-case upstairs.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	16446	16425	16476	Dorcas	He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in the lock of the despatch-case upstairs. [MASK]'s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head. "That's it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	16525	16484	16533	Dorcas	"Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was to-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green dress in her wardrobe?" [MASK] was rather startled by the unexpected question.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	16634	16615	16664	Poirot	And nobody else has anything green?" "No, sir not that I know of." [MASK]'s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or otherwise. He merely remarked: "Good, we will leave that and pass on.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	16841	16823	16877	Annie	"I'm afraid I couldn't, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps [MASK] could tell you, though she's a careless girl. Never cleared the coffee-cups away last night. That's what happens when I'm not here to look after things."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	16890	16883	16935	Dorcas	"Since they have been left, [MASK], leave them a little longer, I pray you. I should like to examine them." "Very well, sir." "What time did you go out last evening?" "About six o'clock, sir."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	16940	16902	16951	Dorcas	I should like to examine them." "Very well, sir." "What time did you go out last evening?" "About six o'clock, sir." "Thank you, [MASK], that is all I have to ask you."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	17120	17111	17154	Dorcas	" I asked, in lively curiosity, as [MASK] left the room. "And about the lost key and the duplicate?" "One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	17366	17326	17373	Poirot	"Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his printed name?" "No, I can't say that I have." I was becoming quite excited, but [MASK] damped my ardour by remarking: "
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	17605	17573	17624	Poirot	"I'm sorry, sir, but it's clean gone. I don't think I can have noticed it." "It does not matter," said [MASK], not betraying any sign of disappointment. "Now I want to ask you about something else.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	17980	17980	18024	Annie	[MASK] had been growing redder and redder in the face, and now she blurted out unexpectedly: "And if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn't me. I never took the salt near it."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	18038	18016	18069	Poirot	I never took the salt near it." "What makes you think there was salt in it?" asked [MASK]. "Seeing it on the tray, sir." "You saw some salt on the tray?" "Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	18127	18119	18166	Dorcas	But I was in a hurry, because [MASK] was out, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt had only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took it in."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	18181	18167	18220	Annie	I had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to herself, [MASK] had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How she would have gaped if she had realized that her "coarse kitchen salt" was strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	18224	18192	18247	Poirot	How she would have gaped if she had realized that her "coarse kitchen salt" was strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I marvelled at [MASK]'s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited his next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	18551	18535	18585	Annie	"Not green, sir." "Nor anyone else in the house?" [MASK] reflected. "No, sir." "You are sure of that?" "Quite sure." "_Bien!_ That is all I want to know.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	18597	18554	18605	Annie	"No, sir." "You are sure of that?" "Quite sure." "_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much." With a nervous giggle, [MASK] took herself creakingly out of the room.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	18615	18606	18656	Poirot	My pent-up excitement burst forth. "[MASK]," I cried, "I congratulate you! This is a great discovery." "What is a great discovery?" "Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	18700	18657	18708	Hastings	That explains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early morning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night." "So you think that the cocoa mark well what I say, [MASK], the _cocoa_ contained strychnine?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	18737	18714	18763	Poirot	That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?" "It might have been salt," replied [MASK] placidly. I shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way, it was no good arguing with him.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	18779	18740	18783	Poirot	I shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way, it was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the first time, that poor old [MASK] was growing old.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	18830	18813	18864	Poirot	"You are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_" "My dear [MASK]," I said coldly, "it is not for me to dictate to you. You have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	18873	18848	18889	Poirot	You have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine." "A most admirable sentiment," remarked [MASK], rising briskly to his feet. "Now I have finished with this room.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	19310	19272	19318	Poirot	Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal possession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she might have taken her own life? I was about to expound these theories to [MASK], when his own words distracted me.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	19339	19319	19366	Poirot	"Come," he said, "now to examine the coffee-cups!" "My dear [MASK]! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know about the cocoa?" "Oh, _l l !_
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	19373	19359	19403	Poirot	"Oh, _l l !_ That miserable cocoa!" cried [MASK] flippantly. He laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock despair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste. "
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	19456	19456	19506	Poirot	[MASK] was sobered at once. "Come, come, my friend," he said, slipping his arms through mine. "_Ne vous f chez pas!_ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I will respect your cocoa.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	19759	19733	19782	Bien	His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered there that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved. "_[MASK]!_" he said at last. "It is evident! I had an idea but clearly I was mistaken.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	19859	19820	19868	Poirot	I could have told him from the beginning that this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind alley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, [MASK] had been a great man in his day.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	20091	20073	20125	Lawrence	Can you tell me the views of the other members of the family?" "My brother [MASK] is convinced that we are making a fuss over nothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of heart failure." "He does, does he?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	20210	20210	20256	Poirot	[MASK] bent his head. "It's an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him as usual but, hang it all, one's gorge does rise at sitting down to eat with a possible murderer!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	20257	20215	20265	Poirot	"It's an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him as usual but, hang it all, one's gorge does rise at sitting down to eat with a possible murderer!" [MASK] nodded sympathetically. "I quite understand.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	42	20379	20346	20388	Poirot	"I have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the hall drawer. I'll go and see if it's there now." [MASK] held up his hand with a faint smile.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	20475	20431	20478	John	"But do you think " "I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his return, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his favour. That is all." [MASK] looked perplexed.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	20486	20479	20525	Poirot	"Do not worry," said [MASK] smoothly. "I assure you that you need not let it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some breakfast." Everyone was assembled in the dining-room.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	20882	20834	20884	Poirot	The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I asked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly: "Yes, I've got the most beastly headache." "Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?" said [MASK] solicitously.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	20918	20885	20935	Cynthia	"It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the _mal de t te_." He jumped up and took her cup. "No sugar," said [MASK], watching him, as he picked up the sugar-tongs. "No sugar?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	20966	20958	21012	Poirot	" "_Sacr !_" murmured [MASK] to himself, as he brought back the replenished cup. Only I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw that his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were as green as a cat's.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	21063	21013	21065	Dorcas	He had heard or seen something that had affected him strongly but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense, but I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_ attention. In another moment, the door opened and [MASK] appeared.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	21101	21101	21152	John	[MASK] rose immediately. "Show him into my study." Then he turned to us. "My mother's lawyer," he explained. And in a lower voice: "He is also Coroner you understand. Perhaps you would like to come with me?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	21163	21119	21166	John	"My mother's lawyer," he explained. And in a lower voice: "He is also Coroner you understand. Perhaps you would like to come with me?" We acquiesced and followed him out of the room. [MASK] strode on ahead
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	21186	21186	21233	Poirot	[MASK] nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that my curiosity was aroused. "What is it? You are not attending to what I say." "It is true, my friend. I am much worried."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	21317	21280	21329	John	My instinct was right." "What instinct?" "The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups. _Chut!_ no more now!" We followed [MASK] into his study, and he closed the door behind us.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	21462	21417	21463	Bauerstein	"I wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it's quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor's certificate." "Yes, I suppose so." "Clever man, [MASK].
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	21478	21464	21516	John	Great authority on toxicology, I believe." "Indeed," said [MASK] with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he added rather hesitatingly: "Shall we have to appear as witnesses all of us, I mean?" "You, of course and ah er
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	21564	21521	21567	John	" A slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner: "Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of form." "I see." A faint expression of relief swept over [MASK]'s face.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	21657	21615	21669	Cavendish	The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?" "Yes." "Then that arrangement will suit you?" "Perfectly." "I need not tell you, my dear [MASK], how distressed I am at this most tragic affair."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	57	21793	21737	21794	John	It is merely a note asking me to call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of great importance." "She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?" "Unfortunately, no." "That is a pity," said [MASK].
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	22491	22447	22501	John	"Which simplifies matters very much," murmured the lawyer. "As technically, of course, he was entitled " He did not finish the sentence. "We will look through the desk in the boudoir first," explained [MASK], "and go up to her bedroom afterwards.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	22563	22523	22570	Poirot	"Yes," said the lawyer, "it is quite possible that there may be a later will than the one in my possession." "There _is_ a later will." It was [MASK] who spoke. "What?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	22571	22571	22624	John	[MASK] and the lawyer looked at him startled. "Or, rather," pursued my friend imperturbably, "there _was_ one." "What do you mean there was one? Where is it now?" "Burnt!" "Burnt?" "Yes.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	22750	22719	22772	Poirot	"If you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to you." "Oh, of course but I don't see " [MASK] raised his hand. "Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	23087	23084	23136	Willum	She just told [MASK] to go on his bicycle down to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like I don't know what exactly she wrote it down for him." "Well?" "Well, he did, sir."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	23173	23165	23209	Willum	"Yes, sir, both me and [MASK], she called." "And then?" "She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long paper under where she'd signed."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	23225	23210	23254	Poirot	"Did you see anything of what was written above her signature?" asked [MASK] sharply. "No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part." "And you signed where she told you?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	23264	23255	23306	Willum	"Yes, sir, first me and then [MASK]." "What did she do with it afterwards?" "Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a sort of purple box that was standing on the desk."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	23519	23487	23536	John	"What do you mean?" "Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with someone yesterday afternoon " "What do you mean?" cried [MASK] again. There was a tremor in his voice, and he had gone very pale.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	23608	23565	23618	Cavendish	She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she would have consulted me on the subject but she had no chance. The will disappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. [MASK], I much fear there is no coincidence there.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	23694	23660	23714	Poirot	But for him, we should never have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur, what first led you to suspect the fact?" [MASK] smiled and answered: "A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	24100	24061	24104	Hastings	"No." "I thought not. Come along, breakfast's not cleared away yet, and they'll make you some fresh tea." He turned to me. "Look after her, [MASK], will you?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	24246	24243	24286	Evie	"My dear [MASK], don't shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is better to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn't until Friday." "Not until fiddlesticks!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	24509	24505	24557	Evie	Dash it all, [MASK], I can't haul him down to the local police station by the scruff of his neck." "Well, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He's a crafty beggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	24678	24677	24721	Mademoiselle	"[MASK]," he said gravely, "I want to ask you something." "Ask away," said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour. "I want to be able to count upon your help."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	24729	24709	24759	Alfred	"I want to be able to count upon your help." "I'll help you to hang [MASK] with pleasure," she replied gruffly. "Hanging's too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in good old times."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	45	24769	24738	24783	Poirot	"Hanging's too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in good old times." "We are at one then," said [MASK], "for I, too, want to hang the criminal."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	58	24989	24971	25029	Emily	"If you mean that I was fond of her yes, I was. You know, [MASK] was a selfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always wanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for them and, that way she missed love.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	25282	25275	25318	John	As we went up the stairs, [MASK] looked back to the dining-room door, and lowered his voice confidentially: "Look here, what's going to happen when these two meet?" I shook my head helplessly.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	25445	25423	25469	Poirot	"My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I believe," he said. [MASK] drew out the small bunch of keys. "Permit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	25488	25454	25495	John	"Permit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning." "But it's not locked now." "Impossible!" "See." And [MASK] lifted the lid as he spoke.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	25504	25496	25546	Poirot	"_Milles tonnerres!_" cried [MASK], dumbfounded. "And I who have both the keys in my pocket!" He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he stiffened. "_Eh voil une affaire!_ This lock has been forced."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	25551	25509	25558	Poirot	And I who have both the keys in my pocket!" He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he stiffened. "_Eh voil une affaire!_ This lock has been forced." "What?" [MASK] laid down the case again. "
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	25584	25559	25609	Poirot	But who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?" These exclamations burst from us disjointedly. [MASK] answered them categorically almost mechanically. "Who? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	25653	25610	25660	Poirot	Since I was here an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary lock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it." We stared at one another blankly. [MASK] had walked over to the mantelpiece.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	25819	25773	25826	Poirot	Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it, thus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have been something of great importance." "But what was it?" "Ah!" cried [MASK], with a gesture of anger.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	25849	25827	25875	Dorcas	"That, I do not know! A document of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper [MASK] saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I " his anger burst forth freely "miserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	26185	26144	26194	John	She was smiling in her quiet way. "I should like to see a good flare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so much, and saying so little." "[MASK] doesn't think so," I remarked.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	26422	26419	26466	Poirot	I could hear [MASK] shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my diplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the whole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one, doubted the wisdom.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	26501	26489	26537	Poirot	I stepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed [MASK] almost immediately. I drew him aside. "My dear fellow," I said, "is this wise? Surely you don't want the whole house to know of this occurrence?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	26554	26505	26556	Hastings	I drew him aside. "My dear fellow," I said, "is this wise? Surely you don't want the whole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into the criminal's hands." "You think so, [MASK]?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	26771	26743	26790	Cynthia	A slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly: "No." "Only her powders?" The flush deepened as [MASK] replied: "Oh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	26837	26831	26880	mademoiselle	"Ah! Thank you, [MASK]; good morning." As we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than once. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his eyes turned green like a cat's.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	26932	26923	26975	Poirot	I shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that [MASK] was rather too much given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth was only too plain and apparent. "So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box," I remarked.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	26997	26958	27006	Poirot	"So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box," I remarked. "Very simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it myself." [MASK] did not appear to be listening to me.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	27197	27149	27199	Poirot	"One might take that with a grain of salt," I remarked sceptically. "All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon?" [MASK] smiled.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	27861	27828	27880	Poirot	"You are very sure of his guilt?" "Well, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more clearly." "On the contrary," said [MASK] quietly, "there are several points in his favour." "Oh, come now!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	28013	27967	28017	Poirot	His excuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two possibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a reason of his own for his absence." "And that reason?" I asked sceptically. [MASK] shrugged his shoulders.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	28071	28042	28089	Poirot	but that does not of necessity make him a murderer." I shook my head, unconvinced. "We do not agree, eh?" said [MASK]. "Well, let us leave it. Time will show which of us is right.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	28276	28264	28314	Poirot	She would naturally open the door to her own husband." [MASK] shook his head. "Why should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room a most unusual proceeding on her part she had had a most violent quarrel with him that very afternoon.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	28385	28346	28393	Poirot	"There is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door into the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards morning, and bolted it then." "[MASK], is that seriously your opinion?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	28539	28519	28569	Poirot	"Still, it is unimportant, and need not be taken into account." A groan burst from [MASK]. "What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If the fact will not fit the theory let the theory go."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	59	28646	28607	28666	Poirot	He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself occasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the used matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary annoyance vanished. [MASK] had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which commanded a view of the village street.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	29012	28992	29039	Poirot	Something evidently of a non-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door [MASK]'s eyes met mine. "Yes," he said, nodding gravely. "He will have evidence to give at the inquest."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	29053	29029	29080	Poirot	He will have evidence to give at the inquest." We went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when [MASK] stopped me with a gesture of his hand. "Not now, not now, _mon ami_. I have need of reflection.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	29231	29194	29244	Poirot	"And what are they?" "The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very important." "But it was a glorious day!" I interrupted. "[MASK], you're pulling my leg!" "Not at all.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	29809	29798	29848	Belgies	As waves his hands when he talks? One of them [MASK] from the village?" "Yes," I said eagerly. "He has been here, then?" "Oh, ay, he's been here, right enough. More'n once too.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	30025	30015	30061	Dorcas	He once or twice observed to me that he thought [MASK] must have made an error in fixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it was four-thirty, and not four o'clock when she had heard the voices.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	59	30063	30039	30098	Dorcas	He suggested to her repeatedly that it was four-thirty, and not four o'clock when she had heard the voices. But [MASK] was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed between the time when she had heard the voices and five o'clock, when she had taken tea to her mistress.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	58	30113	30067	30125	Poirot	Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed between the time when she had heard the voices and five o'clock, when she had taken tea to her mistress. The inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village. [MASK] and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	30625	30586	30636	Poirot	Could the strychnine have been administered in that?" "No, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and had it analysed. There was no strychnine present." I heard [MASK] chuckle softly beside me. "How did you know?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	30975	30964	31005	Lawrence	"It is just an idea of mine," explained [MASK]. "Of course I may be quite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother's death might be accounted for by natural means."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	31065	31044	31091	Lawrence	"Ah!" said the Coroner. The jury looked up, interested. "I believe," continued [MASK], "that there have been cases where the cumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by causing death.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	31383	31344	31396	Dorcas	The same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the chemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error. "That, of course, is always possible," replied the doctor. But [MASK], who was the next witness called, dispelled even that possibility.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	31610	31610	31657	Dorcas	[MASK] came running down and woke my husband, and we all went to my mother-in-law's room, but it was locked " The Coroner interrupted her. "I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	31793	31784	31830	Poirot	This was news to me and glancing sideways at [MASK], I fancied that it was news to him as well. There was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before she answered: "Yes, that is so."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	32567	32563	32611	Emily	"No, because [MASK] never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But _I_ know her. She wanted me back. But she wasn't going to own that I'd been right. She went round about. Most people do.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	57	33186	33141	33198	Inglethorp	Did he realize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his neck? The Coroner went straight to the point. "On Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of poisoning a dog?" [MASK] replied with perfect calmness: "No, I did not.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	33405	33400	33448	Inglethorp	"Think again." [MASK] shook his head. "I cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking." "In what direction?" "I really can't remember." The Coroner's face grew graver.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	33571	33547	33588	Inglethorp	"_Sacr !_" he murmured. "Does this imbecile of a man _want_ to be arrested?" [MASK] was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials would not have convinced a child.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	33602	33579	33622	Poirot	His futile denials would not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly to the next point, and [MASK] drew a deep breath of relief. "You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	33684	33638	33686	Inglethorp	I had no quarrel with my dear wife. The whole story is absolutely untrue. I was absent from the house the entire afternoon." "Have you anyone who can testify to that?" "You have my word," said [MASK] haughtily.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	33739	33712	33755	Poirot	" "Those witnesses were mistaken." I was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was staggered. I looked at [MASK]. There was an expression of exultation on his face which I could not understand.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	33866	33841	33890	Poirot	In the dim light, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me." "Ah!" murmured [MASK] to himself. "But it is an idea, that!" "You think it is true?" I whispered.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	33919	33887	33935	Inglethorp	" I whispered. "I do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition." "You read my wife's last words as an accusation" [MASK] was continuing "they were, on the contrary, an appeal to me."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	34078	34060	34114	Poirot	In any case, he had had ample time to introduce the poison. At that point, [MASK] nudged me gently, indicating two men who were sitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark, ferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	34117	34094	34143	Poirot	One was a little, sharp, dark, ferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair. I questioned [MASK] mutely. He put his lips to my ear. "Do you know who that little man is?" I shook my head.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	34235	34183	34238	POIROT	There was certainly nothing of the policeman about them. I should never have suspected them of being official personages. I was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict being given: "Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown." CHAPTER VII. [MASK] PAYS HIS DEBTS
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	45	34509	34502	34547	Summerhaye	"Oh, come!" said [MASK], opening his lips for the first time. "Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man's caught red-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	34875	34833	34876	Poirot	I think they would have, if it hadn't been for the Coroner he seemed to be holding them back." "Perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket now," suggested [MASK].
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	34992	34960	35011	Poirot	A wink's as good as a nod from you. You've been on the spot and the Yard doesn't want to make any mistakes, you know." [MASK] nodded gravely. "That is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	35144	35131	35174	Poirot	Can't you give me a little more to go on?" [MASK] reflected a moment. "It can be done," he said at last. "I admit I do not wish it. It forces my hand.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	35340	35332	35387	Japp	"That's a bargain," said [MASK] heartily. "And, on behalf of the Yard, I'm much obliged to you, though I'm bound to confess I can't at present see the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always were a marvel!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	35532	35484	35533	Poirot	"H'm! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility," I remarked. "For, if the case against him is true, how could he defend himself except by silence?" "Why, in a thousand ingenious ways," cried [MASK].
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	35680	35670	35711	Poirot	"Yes, yes, too conclusive," continued [MASK], almost to himself. "Real evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be examined sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	35785	35744	35792	Inglethorp	"Because, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible, it was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has drawn the net so closely that one cut will set [MASK] free." I was silent.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	35800	35789	35840	Poirot	I was silent. And in a minute or two, [MASK] continued: "Let us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who sets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying goes.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	36252	36231	36283	Poirot	Would it be easy?" "No," I said thoughtfully. "Of course an actor " But [MASK] cut me short ruthlessly. "And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they are both clean-shaven men.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	45	36545	36537	36582	Poirot	"Ah, why indeed?" said [MASK], calming down. "If he were arrested, he probably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make him see the gravity of his position.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	36670	36662	36713	Poirot	"Can you not guess?" asked [MASK], smiling. "No, can you?" "Oh, yes, I had a little idea sometime ago and it has turned out to be correct." "You never told me," I said reproachfully.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	36714	36693	36745	Poirot	and it has turned out to be correct." "You never told me," I said reproachfully. [MASK] spread out his hands apologetically. "Pardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_." He turned to me earnestly. "
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	37030	36982	37032	Poirot	You told me yourself that he had started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree." "Yes, that's true. I never thought of that." I was rather startled. "It _is_ odd." [MASK] nodded.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	37222	37222	37273	Poirot	[MASK] nodded reflectively. "Yes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more of that private conversation' than she was willing to admit." "And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to eavesdrop!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	37292	37274	37321	Dorcas	"Exactly. One thing her evidence _has_ shown me. I made a mistake. [MASK] was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the afternoon, about four o'clock, as she said." I looked at him curiously.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	37349	37297	37351	Poirot	The quarrel did take place earlier in the afternoon, about four o'clock, as she said." I looked at him curiously. I had never understood his insistence on that point. "Yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day," continued [MASK]. "
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	37415	37373	37425	Poirot	It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact." "He has insomnia, I believe," I said doubtfully. "Which is a very good, or a very bad explanation," remarked [MASK]. "It covers everything, and explains nothing.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	56	37461	37453	37509	Poirot	"_Mon ami_," replied [MASK] gravely, "when you find that people are not telling you the truth look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the inquest to-day only one at most, two persons were speaking the truth without reservation or subterfuge."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	42	37609	37601	37643	Poirot	Still, I had a great respect for [MASK]'s sagacity except on the occasions when he was what I described to myself as "foolishly pig-headed." "Do you really think so?" I asked. "
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	38036	38036	38091	Poirot	[MASK] politely set chairs for everyone. The Scotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a tangible reality. We had read of such things now we ourselves were actors in the drama.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	38128	38123	38169	Styles	There would be pictures of [MASK], snap-shots of "The family leaving the Inquest" the village photographer had not been idle! All the things that one had read a hundred times things that happen to other people, not to oneself.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	38213	38170	38217	Poirot	And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In front of us were "the detectives in charge of the case." The well-known glib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before [MASK] opened the proceedings.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	38253	38242	38283	Poirot	"_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_," said [MASK], bowing as though he were a celebrity about to deliver a lecture, "I have asked you to come here all together, for a certain object.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	38489	38465	38514	Poirot	"Do you understand now, monsieur?" "No. What do you mean?" "I mean," said [MASK] deliberately, "that you are suspected of poisoning your wife." A little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	56	38630	38622	38678	Inglethorp	he cried menacingly. With an effort, [MASK] raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly and deliberately, he shook his head. "You will not speak?" "No. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	38679	38659	38709	Poirot	I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say." [MASK] nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up. "_Soit!_" he said. "Then I must speak for you."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	38881	38857	38912	Japp	There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!" CHAPTER VIII. FRESH SUSPICIONS There was a moment's stupefied silence. [MASK], who was the least surprised of any of us, was the first to speak. "My word," he cried, "you're the goods!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	38973	38936	38985	Japp	_ I have prepared a list of them names and addresses. You must see them, of course. But you will find it all right." "I'm sure of that." [MASK] lowered his voice. "I'm much obliged to you.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	39001	38978	39025	Inglethorp	"I'm much obliged to you. A pretty mare's nest arresting him would have been." He turned to [MASK]. "But, if you'll excuse me, sir, why couldn't you say all this at the inquest?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	39125	39090	39141	Japp	"With my poor Emily not yet buried, can you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be started." "Between you and me, sir," remarked [MASK], "I'd sooner have any amount of rumours than be arrested for murder.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	39290	39281	39333	Poirot	As they all went out of the room, [MASK] turned and made me a sign to follow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside. "Quick, go to the other wing. Stand there just this side of the baize door.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	39464	39439	39490	Poirot	I stood faithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing happened. It must have been quite twenty minutes before [MASK] rejoined me. "You have not stirred?" "No, I've stuck here like a rock. Nothing's happened."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	39567	39558	39608	Poirot	I made but a slight gesture" I know [MASK]'s gestures "with the left hand, and over went the table by the bed!" He looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to console him. "Never mind, old chap.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	42	39694	39659	39701	Japp	What are you going to do now? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?" "Gone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I am disappointed in [MASK]. He has no method!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	39746	39732	39782	Poirot	I don't like him." "He is clever," observed [MASK] meditatively. "Oh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the plight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	39892	39877	39927	Poirot	Why?" He appeared to be in an absolute frenzy. "My dear [MASK]," I expostulated, "I never thought it would interest you. I didn't know it was of any importance." "Importance? It is of the first importance!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	39942	39942	39990	Hastings	[MASK], do you not see? That alters everything everything!" I had never seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, he mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to himself: "Yes, that alters everything everything."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	40426	40415	40465	Hastings	" He turned to me abruptly. "Tell me, [MASK], you yourself have you no suspicions of anybody?" I hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in itself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	40504	40466	40515	Poirot	I had rejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted. "You couldn't call it a suspicion," I murmured. "It's so utterly foolish." "Come now," urged [MASK] encouragingly. "Do not fear. Speak your mind.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	40758	40728	40777	Inglethorp	That disposes of that." "Oh!" I said, rather nonplussed. "Really," I continued, "it's her extraordinary vehemence against [MASK] that started me off suspecting her. I can't help feeling she'd do anything against him.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	40852	40821	40870	Poirot	"You consider her vehemence unnatural?" "Y es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite sane on that point." [MASK] shook his head energetically. "No, no, you are on a wrong tack there.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	45	41307	41292	41337	Poirot	Why, that will, made on the afternoon of her death may " But [MASK]'s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped. "No, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	41426	41396	41448	Poirot	It is partly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said about her evidence at the inquest that set me off." [MASK] looked puzzled. "What did I say about her evidence at the inquest?" "Don't you remember?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	41534	41526	41578	Poirot	I have a message for you, from [MASK]. He says: "Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!"' Nothing more. Nothing less." " Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.'
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	41834	41794	41846	Poirot	Well, then?" "Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all." And not another word on the subject could I drag out of him. This proceeding of [MASK]'s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me intensely.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	42116	42097	42146	Styles	And I'm thankful he's had the tact to take himself off. It's a good thing [MASK] wasn't the mater's to leave to him. Couldn't bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He's welcome to her money."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	42190	42160	42206	Lawrence	" I asked. "Oh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father's money goes with the place, and [MASK] will stay with us for the present, so there is his share as well.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	42268	42268	42315	Cynthia	[MASK], whose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her pretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who seemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the opening of a new and hopeful future.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	42511	42478	42530	Dorcas	Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they any clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes? After breakfast, [MASK] came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if she might have a few words with me.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	59	42538	42534	42593	Dorcas	What is it, [MASK]?" "Well, it's just this, sir. You'll be seeing the Belgian gentleman to-day perhaps?" I nodded. "Well, sir, you know how he asked me so particular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	42709	42660	42714	Dorcas	A great chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And it came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them. So, if you'd tell the Belgian gentleman " "I will tell him, [MASK]," I promised.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	57	42960	42913	42970	Poirot	There was no one in the hall, and we went straight up to the attic. Sure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with brass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of garment. [MASK] bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	42983	42971	43020	Poirot	There were one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but [MASK] shook his head over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as though he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an exclamation. "What is it?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	43053	43009	43059	Poirot	Suddenly he gave an exclamation. "What is it?" "Look!" The chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom, was a magnificent black beard. "_Oh !_" said [MASK]. "_Oh !_
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	43279	43266	43316	Dorcas	He had the big paper knife in his hand, and Mind, [MASK],' he says, you'll have to be very respectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it's off with your head if I'm at all displeased with you!'
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	43390	43346	43392	Poirot	A real sight she looked. You'd never have believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into such a ruffian. Nobody would have known her." "These evenings must have been great fun," said [MASK] genially.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	43427	43416	43463	Dorcas	"He did have a beard, sir," replied [MASK], smiling. "And well I know it, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And I'm sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	43651	43640	43689	Poirot	"Someone with a good deal of intelligence," remarked [MASK] dryly. "You realize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its presence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be more intelligent.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	43745	43708	43752	Poirot	I acquiesced. "There, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me." I was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly thought that [MASK] appreciated me at my true worth.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	43778	43753	43801	Poirot	"Yes," he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, "you will be invaluable." This was naturally gratifying, but [MASK]'s next words were not so welcome. "I must have an ally in the house," he observed reflectively.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	43829	43802	43852	Poirot	"You have me," I protested. "True, but you are not sufficient." I was hurt, and showed it. [MASK] hurried to explain himself. "You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	43875	43835	43885	John	"You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me. I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way." "Oh, I see. How about [MASK]?" "No, I think not."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	44181	44134	44183	Poirot	I'll admit that it wasn't he who bought strychnine at the chemist's shop. What of that? I dare say he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning." "That is arsenic not strychnine," said [MASK] mildly.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	44244	44205	44256	Poirot	If I'm convinced he did it, it doesn't matter a jot to me _how_ he did it." "Exactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it," said [MASK] quietly. "I will put my question in another form.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	44327	44286	44338	Poirot	Haven't I always told you the man is a villain? Haven't I always told you he would murder her in her bed? Haven't I always hated him like poison?" "Exactly," said [MASK]. "That bears out my little idea entirely."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	44677	44642	44692	Poirot	It can't be true. I don't know what put such a wild such a dreadful idea into my head!" "I am right, am I not?" asked [MASK]. "Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	44765	44743	44790	Poirot	I won't admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a thing." [MASK] nodded, as if satisfied. "I will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	44933	44898	44945	Poirot	"Yes, I can't help doing that. I am always watching always hoping I shall be proved wrong." "If we are wrong, well and good," said [MASK]. "No one will be more pleased than I shall.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	45004	44969	45010	Emily	"I don't know, I don't know " "Come now." "It could be hushed up." "There must be no hushing up." "But [MASK] herself " She broke off.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	45219	45179	45228	Poirot	"Perhaps you don't realize that _I_ am still in the dark." "Really? Is that so, _mon ami?_" "Yes. Enlighten me, will you?" [MASK] studied me attentively for a moment or two.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	45333	45312	45363	Poirot	This time it is a question of ideas." "Still, it would be interesting to know." [MASK] looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head. "You see," he said sadly, "_you_ have no instincts."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	45388	45346	45390	Poirot	"You see," he said sadly, "_you_ have no instincts." "It was intelligence you were requiring just now," I pointed out. "The two often go together," said [MASK] enigmatically.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	45501	45476	45523	Lawrence	But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a grudge against my friend's high-handedness, I saw [MASK] on the croquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about, with a still more ancient mallet.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	45	45567	45549	45594	Lawrence	It was true that I did not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by [MASK]'s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my part, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted him.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	45809	45777	45826	Dorcas	Do you?" I was compelled to shake my head. "What extra coffee-cup?" "I don't know." "He'd better ask [MASK], or one of the maids, if he wants to know about coffee-cups.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	45	45875	45866	45911	Hastings	You're not a connoisseur, are you, [MASK]?" I shook my head. "You miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china it's pure delight to handle it, or even to look at it."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	45920	45912	45963	Poirot	"Well, what am I to tell [MASK]?" "Tell him I don't know what he's talking about. It's double Dutch to me." "All right." I was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me back.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	46145	46127	46174	Poirot	"Pardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have a little idea" [MASK]'s "little ideas" were becoming a perfect byword "and would like to ask one or two questions." "Of me? Certainly."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	46254	46227	46278	Poirot	"I said so at the inquest." "Bolted?" "Yes." She looked perplexed. "I mean," explained [MASK], "you are sure it was bolted, and not merely locked?" "Oh, I see what you mean.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	46405	46371	46420	Lawrence	"I I believe it was." "But you did not see it?" "No. I never looked." "But _I_ did," interrupted [MASK] suddenly. "I happened to notice that it _was_ bolted."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	46430	46408	46455	Poirot	"I happened to notice that it _was_ bolted." "Ah, that settles it." And [MASK] looked crestfallen. I could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his "little ideas" had come to naught.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	46458	46434	46481	Poirot	I could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his "little ideas" had come to naught. After lunch [MASK] begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather stiffly. "You are annoyed, is it not so?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	46563	46527	46577	Lawrence	I had hoped that he would have observed the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words went towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed. "I gave [MASK] your message," I said. "And what did he say?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	46604	46578	46631	Poirot	He was entirely puzzled?" "Yes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant." I had expected [MASK] to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he replied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	46909	46906	46956	Poirot	Why?" [MASK] shrugged his shoulders. "I wondered. That is all. Will you come in?" We had reached the cottage. "No. I think I'll be getting back. I shall go round the long way through the woods."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	47243	47243	47293	Mary	[MASK]'s voice came, cool and liquid: "Have _you_ any right to criticize my actions?" "It will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on Saturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	47388	47340	47395	John	"A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens the" she looked at him "stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman." Fire in her eyes, ice in her voice. I did not wonder that the blood rose to [MASK]'s face in a crimson tide.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	47429	47410	47460	Bauerstein	The pleading died out of his voice. "Am I to understand that you will continue to see [MASK] against my express wishes?" "If I choose." "You defy me?" "No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	47474	47436	47487	John	"If I choose." "You defy me?" "No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have _you_ no friends of whom I should disapprove?" [MASK] fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	47509	47495	47544	Mary	he said, in an unsteady voice. "You see!" said [MASK] quietly. "You _do_ see, don't you, that _you_ have no right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	47545	47512	47561	John	"You _do_ see, don't you, that _you_ have no right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?" [MASK] glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face. "No right?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	47583	47572	47613	Mary	he said unsteadily. He stretched out his hands. "[MASK] " For a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her face, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away. "None!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	47718	47678	47729	John	So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled. She freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder. "Perhaps," she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade, leaving [MASK] standing there as though he had been turned to stone.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	47954	47942	47995	John	Pretty thick, isn't it?" "Cheer up, [MASK]!" I said soothingly. "It can't last for ever." "Can't it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to hold up our heads again."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	48094	48085	48134	Inglethorp	Because because who could have done it? Now [MASK]'s out of the way, there's no one else; no one, I mean, except one of us." Yes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	56	48164	48119	48175	Poirot	Yes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes, surely it must be so, unless - A new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it. The light increased. [MASK]'s mysterious doings, his hints they all fitted in.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	48200	48197	48244	John	"No, [MASK]," I said, "it isn't one of us. How could it be?" "I know, but, still, who else is there?" "Can't you guess?" "No."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	48307	48260	48310	Poirot	I whispered. "Impossible!" "Not at all." "But what earthly interest could he have in my mother's death?" "That I don't see," I confessed, "but I'll tell you this: [MASK] thinks so.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	48419	48414	48465	John	"H'm," said [MASK]. "It would have been very risky." "Yes, but it was possible." "And then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I don't think that will wash."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	48500	48452	48506	Poirot	No, old fellow, I don't think that will wash." But I had remembered something else. "You're quite right. That wasn't how it was done. Listen." And I then told him of the cocoa sample which [MASK] had taken to be analysed.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	48757	48717	48772	John	Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure drug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms." "H'm, yes, that might be," said [MASK]. "But look here, how could he have got at the cocoa?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	48813	48773	48821	John	That wasn't downstairs?" "No, it wasn't," I admitted reluctantly. And then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I hoped and prayed it would not occur to [MASK] also. I glanced sideways at him.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	42	49065	49057	49099	John	"There's another thing," said [MASK] suddenly, and the unexpected sound of his voice made me start guiltily. "Something which makes me doubt if what you say can be true." "What's that?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	56	49131	49081	49137	Bauerstein	Something which makes me doubt if what you say can be true." "What's that?" I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject of how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa. "Why, the fact that [MASK] demanded a post-mortem.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	49253	49244	49295	John	"Yes, that's possible," admitted [MASK]. "Still," he added, "I'm blest if I can see what his motive could have been." I trembled. "Look here," I said, "I may be altogether wrong.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	49338	49318	49365	Voices	We had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate into the garden. [MASK] rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under the sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	49540	49521	49574	Mary	"Yes?" "After tea, I want to talk to you." Her glance at [MASK] had set me thinking. I fancied that between these two there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred to me to wonder about the girl's future.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	49634	49634	49689	John	[MASK], who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger. "Confound those detectives! I can't think what they're after! They've been in every room in the house turning things inside out, and upside down.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	49756	49751	49792	Cynthia	After tea, I invited [MASK] to come for a walk, and we sauntered off into the woods together. "Well?" I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by the leafy screen.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	49797	49776	49825	Cynthia	I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by the leafy screen. With a sigh, [MASK] flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The sunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair to quivering gold.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	49862	49858	49904	Mary	Much more charming than [MASK], who never said things of that kind. "Well?" I asked benignantly, as she hesitated. "I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?" "Do?" "Yes.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	49986	49952	49999	Cynthia	Do you think I ought to go away from here at once?" "Good heavens, no! They don't want to part with you, I'm sure." [MASK] hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	50024	50014	50065	Cynthia	"Hates you?" I cried, astonished. [MASK] nodded. "Yes. I don't know why, but she can't bear me; and _he_ can't, either." "There I know you're wrong," I said warmly.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	50071	50027	50078	John	"Yes. I don't know why, but she can't bear me; and _he_ can't, either." "There I know you're wrong," I said warmly. "On the contrary, [MASK] is very fond of you."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	45	50213	50211	50256	Evie	She wants [MASK] to stay on, is begging her to, but she doesn't want me, and and I don't know what to do." Suddenly the poor child burst out crying. I don't know what possessed me.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	50398	50393	50440	Cynthia	To my intense surprise, [MASK] burst out laughing, and called me a "funny dear." "It's perfectly sweet of you," she said, "but you know you don't want to!" "Yes, I do.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	50579	50533	50580	Bauerstein	And, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished through the trees. Thinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly unsatisfactory. It occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and look up [MASK].
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	50617	50614	50662	Poirot	I remembered how [MASK] had relied on my diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the "Apartments" card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and tapped on the door. An old woman came and opened it.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	50770	50719	50771	Poirot	"No, took by the perlice." "By the police!" I gasped. "Do you mean they've arrested him?" "Yes, that's it, and " I waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find [MASK].
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	50857	50856	50903	Poirot	With [MASK] away, I was uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in all probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not resolve. But in the meantime what was I to do?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	51092	51074	51126	John	Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever. After some reflecting, I decided to take [MASK] into my confidence, and leave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit. He gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	51129	51127	51179	Scott	"Great [MASK]! You _were_ right, then. I couldn't believe it at the time." "No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it makes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	51193	51180	51231	John	Of course, it will be generally known to-morrow." [MASK] reflected. "Never mind," he said at last, "we won't say anything at present. There is no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	51468	51466	51521	Bauerstein	"Is [MASK] arrested, then?" "Did you not know it?" "Not the least in the world." But, pausing a moment, he added: "Still, it does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the coast."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	51543	51509	51560	Poirot	After all, we are only four miles from the coast." "The coast?" I asked, puzzled. "What has that got to do with it?" [MASK] shrugged his shoulders. "Surely, it is obvious!" "Not to me.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	51911	51880	51934	Poirot	"No," I confessed, "I never thought of such a thing." "He is, of course, a German by birth," said [MASK] thoughtfully, "though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of him as anything but an Englishman.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	52000	51954	52004	Poirot	"The blackguard!" I cried indignantly. "Not at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he stands to lose. I admire the man myself." But I could not look at it in [MASK]'s philosophical way.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	52044	52029	52080	Poirot	"Yes. I should fancy he had found her very useful," remarked [MASK]. "So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any other vagaries of the doctor's passed unobserved." "Then you think he never really cared for her?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	52116	52070	52118	Hastings	"Then you think he never really cared for her?" I asked eagerly rather too eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances. "That, of course, I cannot say, but shall I tell you my own private opinion, [MASK]?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	52295	52265	52313	Poirot	She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in the room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she handed to [MASK], murmuring as she did so the cryptic words: "On top of the wardrobe."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	52348	52336	52384	Hastings	He spread it out on the table. "Come here, [MASK]. Now tell me, what is that initial J. or L.?" It was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had lain by for some time.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	52393	52350	52396	Poirot	Now tell me, what is that initial J. or L.?" It was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had lain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting [MASK]'s attention.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	52483	52470	52519	Poirot	"It certainly isn't a J." "Good," replied [MASK], folding up the paper again. "I, also, am of your way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!" "Where did it come from?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	52589	52568	52618	Poirot	"What did she mean by On the top of the wardrobe'?" "She meant," replied [MASK] promptly, "that she found it on top of a wardrobe." "A funny place for a piece of brown paper," I mused.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	52660	52647	52695	Poirot	Neatly arranged, there is nothing to offend the eye." "[MASK]," I asked earnestly, "have you made up your mind about this crime?" "Yes that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	52825	52825	52869	Dorcas	[MASK] looked very surprised. "Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don't know how you came to hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire through.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	52890	52870	52918	Poirot	The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning." With a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, [MASK] led the way back to the morning-room. "See you, one should not ask for outside proof no, reason should be enough.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	53034	53008	53057	Dorcas	She smiled, and so did I. "What is it all about?" "Really, I can't tell you. He asked [MASK] some question about a bell, and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as you see!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	53058	53058	53102	Mary	[MASK] laughed. "How ridiculous! He's going out of the gate. Isn't he coming back to-day?" "I don't know. I've given up trying to guess what he'll do next."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	58	53165	53113	53171	Mary	"I honestly don't know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a hatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method in his madness." "I see." In spite of her laugh, [MASK] was looking thoughtful this morning.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	53197	53172	53220	Cynthia	She seemed grave, almost sad. It occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on the subject of [MASK]. I began rather tactfully, _I_ thought, but I had not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	53510	53468	53520	Cynthia	I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I think yes, I am sure you are kind." Somehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered that [MASK] had begun her confidences in much the same way.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	54344	54327	54375	John	An instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all expression. "[MASK] was so kind as to break that to me this morning." "Well, what do you think?" I asked feebly. "Of what?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	54400	54371	54421	John	"Of what?" "Of the arrest?" "What should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener had told [MASK]." Her face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she care, or did she not?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	54805	54791	54843	Lawrence	He was really treating us in the most cavalier fashion. After lunch, [MASK] drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to see him. "No, I don't think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	54848	54821	54872	Lawrence	"No, I don't think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us." "Oh!" [MASK] looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and excited in his manner roused my curiosity. "What is it?" I asked.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	57	54931	54884	54941	Poirot	"It's nothing much, but well, if you are going, will you tell him " he dropped his voice to a whisper "I think I've found the extra coffee-cup!" I had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of [MASK]'s, but now my curiosity was aroused afresh.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	54992	54984	55032	Poirot	Would I mount? I mounted accordingly. [MASK] was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He sprang up at my entrance. "What is it?" I asked solicitously. "You are not ill, I trust?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	55072	55023	55075	Poirot	"You are not ill, I trust?" "No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment." "Whether to catch the criminal or not?" I asked facetiously. But, to my great surprise, [MASK] nodded gravely.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	55114	55108	55159	Poirot	"You are not serious, [MASK]?" "I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in the balance." "And that is?" "A woman's happiness, _mon ami_," he said gravely.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	55177	55138	55189	Poirot	"And that is?" "A woman's happiness, _mon ami_," he said gravely. I did not quite know what to say. "The moment has come," said [MASK] thoughtfully, "and I do not know what to do.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	55245	55218	55266	Lawrence	And he tapped himself proudly on the breast. After pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his effect, I gave him [MASK]'s message. "Aha!" he cried. "So he has found the extra coffee-cup.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	55386	55340	55390	Cynthia	However, the other young lady was most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me everything in the kindest way." "Oh, well, that's all right, then, and you must go to tea with [MASK] another day."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	55676	55666	55716	Poirot	"Oh, yes; they are identical." [MASK] nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up again. "I suppose," I said, "that as usual, you are not going to explain?" "On the contrary.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	56	55984	55949	56005	Poirot	He never went near the poison cupboard the day we were there!" "Oh, yes, he did!" "Impossible! We were all together the whole time." [MASK] shook his head. "No, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	56073	56051	56100	Poirot	"But it was only for a moment." "Long enough." "Long enough for what?" [MASK]'s smile became rather enigmatical. "Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	56105	56080	56124	Poirot	"Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity." Our eyes met. [MASK]'s were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a little tune. I watched him suspiciously.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	56263	56215	56265	Poirot	Strychnine Hydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the finger-marks have remained undisturbed since then." "How did you manage to take this photograph?" "I dropped my hat from the balcony," explained [MASK] simply.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	56383	56367	56421	Poirot	This is a very important discovery." "I do not know," said [MASK]. "But one thing does strike me. No doubt it has struck you too." "What is that?" "Why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	45	56587	56580	56625	Poirot	"Alas, madame," said [MASK], "I thought you had come to honour me with a visit!" "I will some day, if you ask me," she promised him, smiling. "That is well.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	56745	56729	56773	Mary	The weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its shrewishness. [MASK] shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports coat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like some great giant sighing.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	56797	56797	56838	Dorcas	[MASK] came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her hands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the background, all eyes and ears. "Oh, m'am! Oh, m'am!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	56853	56805	56855	Dorcas	She was crying and wringing her hands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the background, all eyes and ears. "Oh, m'am! Oh, m'am! I don't know how to tell you " "What is it, [MASK]?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	57025	57020	57070	Poirot	I expressed my admiration to [MASK], and he nodded thoughtfully. "Yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her jealousy have " "Jealousy?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	56	57204	57150	57206	Lawrence	With his tenderness for "a woman's happiness," I felt glad that the decision had been taken out of his hands. "Even now," I said, "I can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very last minute, I thought it was [MASK]!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	57407	57404	57453	Poirot	"But, [MASK] " I protested. "Oh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs. It is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another matter to prove him so.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	57672	57655	57698	John	"So," I cried, a light breaking in upon me, "it was [MASK] who quarrelled with his mother that afternoon?" "Exactly." "And you have known this all along?" "Certainly.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	57722	57711	57760	Poirot	"And yet you say he may be acquitted?" [MASK] shrugged his shoulders. "Certainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the case for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will advise him to reserve his defence.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	57978	57932	57980	Poirot	If I am called upon to give evidence at all" he smiled broadly "it will probably be as a witness for the defence." I could hardly believe my ears. "It is quite _en r gle_," continued [MASK]. "
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	58120	58091	58139	Poirot	I myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see them continually. As the weeks went by, the state of [MASK]'s nerves grew worse and worse. That "last link" he talked about was still lacking.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	59664	59629	59675	Heavywether	"The same address to which you sent the parcel?" "Yes." "And the letter came from there?" "Yes." Like a beast of prey, [MASK] fell upon him: "How do you know?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	59970	59961	60009	John	What a net he has drawn around my poor [MASK]! How he twisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn't!" "Well," I said consolingly, "it will be the other way about to-morrow."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	60102	60096	60148	Lawrence	"Do you think he believes [MASK] guilty?" "I do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying for is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are divided in their opinion as to which brother did it.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	60412	60391	60441	Japp	This placed beyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of the deceased lady's husband. [MASK] then produced the charred fragment of paper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the beard in the attic, completed his evidence.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	60964	60938	60989	Lawrence	In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will inherit Styles Court?" The brutality of the question called a flush to [MASK]'s pale face. The judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	61015	60999	61051	Lawrence	"Answer my question, if you please." "I suppose," said [MASK] quietly, "that I should." "What do you mean by you suppose'? Your brother has no children. You _would_ inherit it, wouldn't you?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	61065	61034	61087	Heavywether	Your brother has no children. You _would_ inherit it, wouldn't you?" "Yes." "Ah, that's better," said [MASK], with ferocious geniality. "And you'd inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn't you?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	61257	61257	61310	Lawrence	[MASK] was turning a sickly greenish colour. "N o I am sure I didn't." "Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable impress of your finger-prints on it?" The bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	56	61491	61438	61494	Lawrence	"No, but " "In fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple of minutes, and it happened I say, it happened to be during those two minutes that you displayed your natural interest' in Hydro-chloride of Strychnine?" [MASK] stammered pitiably.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	62931	62912	62965	Poirot	He had that little frown between the eyes that I knew so well. "What is it, [MASK]?" I inquired. "Ah, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly." In spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	56	62988	62977	63033	Mary	When we reached the house, my little friend waved aside [MASK]'s offer of tea. "No, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room." I followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out a small pack of patience cards.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	63142	63102	63149	Poirot	With precision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I needed that more than now!" "What is the trouble?" I asked. With a great thump on the table, [MASK] demolished his carefully built up edifice.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	63311	63271	63320	Poirot	"What a steady hand you've got," I remarked. "I believe I've only seen your hand shake once." "On an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt," observed [MASK], with great placidity. "Yes indeed!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	63388	63378	63421	Poirot	I must say " But I stopped suddenly. For [MASK], uttering a hoarse and inarticulate cry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands over his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the keenest agony.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	63426	63422	63474	Poirot	"Good heavens, [MASK]!" I cried. "What is the matter? Are you taken ill?" "No, no," he gasped. "It is it is that I have an idea!" "Oh!" I exclaimed, much relieved.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	63496	63475	63525	Poirot	"One of your little ideas'?" "Ah, _ma foi_, no!" replied [MASK] frankly. "This time it is an idea gigantic! Stupendous! And you _you_, my friend, have given it to me!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	63587	63573	63619	Heaven	He rushed past me crying out: A garage! For the love of [MASK], direct me to a garage, madame!' And, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street." I hurried to the window.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	63643	63620	63670	Mary	True enough, there he was, tearing down the street, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. I turned to [MASK] with a gesture of despair. "He'll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes, round the corner!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	63730	63691	63742	Mary	I shook my head. "I don't know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he had an idea, and rushed off as you saw." "Well," said [MASK], "I expect he will be back before dinner."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	42	64867	64827	64869	Lawrence	"In a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many misconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true significance." "The will!" cried [MASK]. "
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	41	65260	65245	65286	Dorcas	I faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four o'clock, [MASK] overheard her mistress saying angrily: You need not think that any fear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	65336	65333	65388	Dorcas	She admits to [MASK], I don't know what to do; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.' At four o'clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five o'clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great shock.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	65656	65648	65700	Dorcas	We know this, because later she asked [MASK] to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room stood her husband's desk locked. She was anxious to find some stamps, and, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	66793	66777	66828	Lawrence	But you would not trust me." "I see everything now," said [MASK]. "The drugged cocoa, taken on top of the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay." "Exactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	67116	67116	67167	Poirot	[MASK] looked round the room, and then answered himself impressively. "Her medicine!" "Do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her tonic?" I cried. "There was no need to introduce it. It was already there in the mixture.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	55	67828	67792	67847	Poirot	We all know this hand-writing and " A howl that was almost a scream broke the silence. "You devil! How did you get it?" A chair was overturned. [MASK] skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement on his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	67971	67971	68024	Poirot	[MASK] did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said: "I did not deceive you, _mon ami_. At most, I permitted you to deceive yourself." "Yes, but why?" "Well, it is difficult to explain.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	68124	68088	68135	Poirot	And then, _bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!" "I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for." "My friend," besought [MASK], "I implore you, do not enrage yourself!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	56	68668	68652	68708	John	But, when I discovered that it was known all over the village that it was [MASK] who was attracted by the farmer's pretty wife, his silence bore quite a different interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid of the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	50	68904	68860	68910	Poirot	He would then produce his irreproachable alibi and, hey presto, he was safe for life!" "But I still don't see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to the chemist's shop?" [MASK] stared at me in surprise.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	68979	68949	68998	Inglethorp	Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a good height, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and [MASK] are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between them, especially in their gait and bearing.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	53	69303	69263	69316	Poirot	If they had left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been brought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too clever and that was their undoing." [MASK] puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	47	69473	69464	69511	John	"But, as it will never do if [MASK], too, can prove an alibi, she writes him an anonymous note still copying his hand-writing which takes him to a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see him.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	70006	69973	70024	Annie	I have discovered that there were only five short minutes in which he could have taken it the five minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before that time [MASK] was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who passed going to the right wing.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	57	70338	70283	70340	Poirot	"In a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other spills in the vase on the mantle-piece." I uttered an exclamation. "No one would think of looking there," [MASK] continued.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	57	70394	70394	70451	Poirot	[MASK] nodded. "Yes, my friend. That is where I discovered my last link,' and I owe that very fortunate discovery to you." "To me?" "Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was straightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	70583	70563	70612	Inglethorp	"Yes, and it was a race for time." "But I still can't understand why [MASK] was such a fool as to leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it." "Ah, but he had no opportunity.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	70669	70663	70714	Inglethorp	I was not sure then if [MASK] was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he would not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere, and by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually prevent his destroying it.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	52	71483	71457	71509	John	No suspicion attaches to her. No notice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the strychnine and glasses in [MASK]'s room. She puts the beard in the attic. She will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	42	71524	71487	71529	John	She puts the beard in the attic. She will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered." "I don't quite see why they tried to fix the blame on [MASK]," I remarked.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	71545	71530	71584	Lawrence	"It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime home to [MASK]." "Yes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out of pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to the pair of schemers."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	54	71849	71824	71878	Poirot	"But why should he shield her?" "Because he is in love with her." I laughed. "There, [MASK], you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that, far from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	46	71892	71856	71902	Cynthia	I happen to know for a fact that, far from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her." "Who told you that, _mon ami?_" "[MASK] herself." "_La pauvre petite!_
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	72220	72202	72246	Poirot	"They were, of course, an accusation against her husband." "Dear me, [MASK]," I said with a sigh, "I think you have explained everything. I am glad it has all ended so happily.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	72248	72247	72295	John	Even [MASK] and his wife are reconciled." "Thanks to me." "How do you mean thanks to you?" "My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the trial which has brought them together again?
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	72582	72545	72594	Poirot	But I eventually decided in favour of a woman's happiness'. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed could have brought these two proud souls together again." I looked at [MASK] in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the little man!
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	51	72684	72647	72698	Mary	And you are wrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the greatest thing in all the world." His words took me back to earlier events. I remembered [MASK] as she lay white and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	48	72714	72699	72747	Poirot	There had come the sound of the bell below. She had started up. [MASK] had opened the door, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. "Yes, madame," he said. "I have brought him back to you."
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	43	72816	72792	72835	Cynthia	"Yes, it is the greatest thing in the world." Suddenly, there was a tap at the door, and [MASK] peeped in. "I I only " "Come in," I said, springing up.
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	44	73010	73000	73044	Cynthia	A man in love is a sorry spectacle. Now [MASK] had looked charming. I sighed. "What is it, _mon ami?_" "Nothing," I said sadly. "They are two delightful women!"
TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles	49	73056	73018	73067	Poirot	"What is it, _mon ami?_" "Nothing," I said sadly. "They are two delightful women!" "And neither of them is for you?" finished [MASK]. "Never mind. Console yourself, my friend.
