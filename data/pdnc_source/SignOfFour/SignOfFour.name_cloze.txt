SignOfFour	50	2623	2623	2673	Jewelry	[MASK] usually descends to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother."
SignOfFour	51	2772	2765	2816	Holmes	"This is unworthy of you, [MASK]," I said. "I could not have believed that you would have descended to this. You have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way.
SignOfFour	51	4340	4296	4347	Holmes	He came home with his heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and instead " She put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short the sentence. "The date?" asked [MASK], opening his note-book.
SignOfFour	50	4775	4733	4783	Holmes	"Yes, and no later than to-day. That is why I have come to you. This morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for yourself." "Thank you," said [MASK]. "The envelope too, please.
SignOfFour	51	5053	5012	5063	Holmes	"I have led a retired life, and have no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?" "You must not be later," said [MASK]. "There is one other point, however.
SignOfFour	50	5600	5554	5604	Holmes	Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you make of this fellow s scribble?" "It is legible and regular," I answered. "A man of business habits and some force of character." [MASK] shook his head.
SignOfFour	49	6411	6375	6424	Holmes	Are you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour." I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that [MASK] took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket.
SignOfFour	50	6611	6611	6661	Holmes	[MASK] unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee. He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens. "It is paper of native Indian manufacture," he remarked. "It has at some time been pinned to a board.
SignOfFour	51	8156	8156	8207	Nature	[MASK] had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of his obtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth.
SignOfFour	48	8880	8853	8901	Holmes	He sat down upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery blue eyes. "For my part," said [MASK], "whatever you may choose to say will go no further." I nodded to show my agreement.
SignOfFour	43	8930	8928	8971	Tokay	Or of [MASK]? I keep no other wines. Shall I open a flask? No? Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odour of the Eastern tobacco.
SignOfFour	52	9110	9092	9144	Williams	I took the liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man [MASK] might be able to see you first. I have complete confidence in his discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed no further in the matter.
SignOfFour	45	9892	9855	9900	India	My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father s, but events have since led us to change our opinion. "Early in 1882 my father received a letter from [MASK] which was a great shock to him.
SignOfFour	43	10099	10059	10102	Morstan	I shall try and give it to you in his own very words. " I have only one thing, he said, which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment. It is my treatment of poor [MASK] s orphan.
SignOfFour	48	10259	10239	10287	Morstan	After all, men have been as bad as this and have recovered. " I will tell you how [MASK] died, he continued. He had suffered for years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one. I alone knew it.
SignOfFour	46	10381	10381	10427	Morstan	[MASK] had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cutting his head against the corner of the treasure-chest.
SignOfFour	44	10612	10597	10641	Sahib	He stole in and bolted the door behind him. "Do not fear, [MASK]," he said. "No one need know that you have killed him. Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?"
SignOfFour	51	10666	10660	10711	Sahib	"I heard it all, [MASK]," said he. "I heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow. But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house. Let us put him away together." That was enough to decide me.
SignOfFour	51	10811	10769	10820	Morstan	You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter. My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure, and that I have clung to [MASK] s share as well as to my own.
SignOfFour	52	11462	11417	11469	Bartholomew	It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died. We could judge the splendour of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out. Over this chaplet my brother [MASK] and I had some little discussion.
SignOfFour	54	11824	11824	11878	Holmes	[MASK] was the first to spring to his feet. "You have done well, sir, from first to last," said he. "It is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you.
SignOfFour	50	12464	12446	12496	Holmes	I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night. [MASK] declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative.
SignOfFour	48	12722	12675	12723	McMurdo	A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat. "Who is there?" cried a gruff voice from within. "It is I, [MASK].
SignOfFour	46	12810	12790	12836	McMurdo	But who are the others? I had no orders about them from the master." "No, [MASK]? You surprise me! I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends." "He ain t been out o
SignOfFour	46	12906	12898	12944	McMurdo	"This is too bad of you, [MASK]!" he said. "If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young lady, too. She cannot wait on the public road at this hour."
SignOfFour	48	13336	13315	13363	Bartholomew	"I cannot understand it," he said. "There must be some mistake. I distinctly told [MASK] that we should be here, and yet there is no light in his window. I do not know what to make of it."
SignOfFour	52	13377	13364	13416	Holmes	"Does he always guard the premises in this way?" asked [MASK]. "Yes; he has followed my father s custom. He was the favourite son, you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me.
SignOfFour	49	13419	13379	13428	Bartholomew	"Yes; he has followed my father s custom. He was the favourite son, you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me. That is [MASK] s window up there where the moonshine strikes.
SignOfFour	51	13451	13429	13480	Holmes	It is quite bright, but there is no light from within, I think." "None," said [MASK]. "But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door." "Ah, that is the housekeeper s room.
SignOfFour	53	13732	13703	13756	Holmes	" We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone. Our guide had left us the lantern. [MASK] swung it slowly round, and peered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds.
SignOfFour	46	13964	13955	14001	Holmes	"And from the same cause," said [MASK]. "These are the traces of the treasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years looking for it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit."
SignOfFour	56	14037	14031	14087	Bartholomew	"There is something amiss with [MASK]!" he cried. "I am frightened! My nerves cannot stand it." He was, indeed, half blubbering with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified child.
SignOfFour	48	14096	14056	14104	Holmes	He was, indeed, half blubbering with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified child. "Come into the house," said [MASK], in his crisp, firm way.
SignOfFour	47	14252	14219	14266	Master	Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the colour back into the other s bloodless cheeks. "[MASK] has locked himself in and will not answer me," she explained.
SignOfFour	48	14553	14553	14601	Holmes	[MASK] knocked without receiving any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open. It was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp up against it.
SignOfFour	43	14643	14635	14678	Watson	"There is something devilish in this, [MASK]," said he, more moved than I had ever before seen him. "What do you make of it?" I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror.
SignOfFour	53	14731	14679	14732	Thaddeus	Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance. Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face, the very face of our companion [MASK].
SignOfFour	49	14847	14843	14892	Holmes	" I said to [MASK]. "What is to be done?" "The door must come down," he answered, and, springing against it, he put all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not yield.
SignOfFour	48	16036	15998	16046	Watson	Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, [MASK]! This is really a very pretty demonstration."
SignOfFour	46	16462	16419	16465	Holmes	"This is all very well," said I, "but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he into the room?" "Yes, the ally!" repeated [MASK], pensively.
SignOfFour	51	17033	17032	17083	Holmes	"[MASK]," I said, in a whisper, "a child has done the horrid thing." He had recovered his self-possession in an instant. "I was staggered for the moment," he said, "but the thing is quite natural.
SignOfFour	49	17146	17114	17163	Watson	"What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?" I asked, eagerly, when we had regained the lower room once more. "My dear [MASK], try a little analysis yourself," said he, with a touch of impatience.
SignOfFour	50	17572	17542	17592	Holmes	Heavy steps and the clamour of loud voices were audible from below, and the hall door shut with a loud crash. "Before they come," said [MASK], "just put your hand here on this poor fellow s arm, and here on his leg.
SignOfFour	50	18212	18186	18236	Holmes	What d you think the man died of?" "Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorise over," said [MASK], dryly. "No, no. Still, we can t deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes.
SignOfFour	48	18375	18366	18414	Sholto	The brother died in a fit, on which [MASK] walked off with the treasure. How s that?" "On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside." "Hum! There s a flaw there.
SignOfFour	52	18738	18691	18743	Holmes	" With great activity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door. "He can find something," remarked [MASK], shrugging his shoulders.
SignOfFour	44	19264	19259	19303	Watson	A word with you, [MASK]." He led me out to the head of the stair. "This unexpected occurrence," he said, "has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey."
SignOfFour	49	19991	19953	20002	Holmes	She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still, she was rich. If [MASK] s researches were successful, she would be an heiress.
SignOfFour	58	20934	20933	20991	Toby	"[MASK] lives at No. 7 on the left here." He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him. In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner.
SignOfFour	55	21175	21151	21206	Holmes	Two constables guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective s name. [MASK] was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe. "Ah, you have him there!" said he.
SignOfFour	47	21275	21273	21320	Toby	We tied [MASK] to the hall table, and re-ascended the stairs. The room was as he had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure. A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner.
SignOfFour	50	21379	21371	21421	Watson	Just you carry them down with you, [MASK]. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip my handkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into the garret with me for a moment." We clambered up through the hole.
SignOfFour	50	21422	21398	21448	Holmes	That will do. Now come up into the garret with me for a moment." We clambered up through the hole. [MASK] turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust. "I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks," he said.
SignOfFour	45	21649	21609	21654	Toby	I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell. "That is where he put his foot in getting out. If _you_ can trace him, I should think that [MASK] will have no difficulty.
SignOfFour	53	21753	21705	21758	Watson	I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon the opposite side. When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves. "That you, [MASK]?" he cried.
SignOfFour	50	22083	22063	22113	Watson	I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself. Are you game for a six-mile trudge, [MASK]?" "Certainly," I answered. "Your leg will stand it?" "Oh, yes." "Here you are, doggy!
SignOfFour	52	22121	22118	22170	Toby	Smell it, [MASK], smell it!" He pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog s nose, while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the _bouquet_ of a famous vintage.
SignOfFour	56	22425	22425	22481	Holmes	[MASK] clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon the other side. "There s the print of wooden-leg s hand," he remarked, as I mounted up beside him. "You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster.
SignOfFour	48	22553	22519	22567	Toby	I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval. My fears were soon appeased, however. [MASK] never hesitated or swerved, but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion.
SignOfFour	51	22591	22568	22619	Holmes	Clearly, the pungent smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents. "Do not imagine," said [MASK], "that I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot in the chemical.
SignOfFour	45	22725	22708	22753	Holmes	"There is credit, and to spare," said I. "I assure you, [MASK], that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder.
SignOfFour	49	22785	22754	22803	Pshaw	The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?" "[MASK], my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don t wish to be theatrical.
SignOfFour	48	23655	23627	23675	Toby	He takes with him, however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into creasote, whence comes [MASK], and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis."
SignOfFour	56	24017	23963	24019	Paul	It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature! Are you well up in your Jean [MASK]?"
SignOfFour	50	24102	24053	24103	Richter	It is that the chief proof of man s real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility. There is much food for thought in [MASK].
SignOfFour	51	24141	24141	24192	Jonathan	[MASK] I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead." He took out his revolver as he spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket.
SignOfFour	57	24203	24161	24218	Toby	He took out his revolver as he spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket. We had during this time been following the guidance of [MASK] down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis.
SignOfFour	47	24301	24285	24332	Toby	Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed, but our inimitable [MASK] looked neither to the right nor to the left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent.
SignOfFour	57	24503	24464	24521	Holmes	Then he waddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment. "What the deuce is the matter with the dog?" growled [MASK]. "They surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon."
SignOfFour	56	24762	24755	24811	Toby	With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, [MASK] stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creasote.
SignOfFour	42	24848	24814	24856	Toby	and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. Chapter VIII The Baker Street Irregulars "What now?" I asked. "[MASK] has lost his character for infallibility."
SignOfFour	50	25010	24986	25036	Toby	We took the wrong one. It only remains to follow the other." There was no difficulty about this. On leading [MASK] to the place where he had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally dashed off in a fresh direction.
SignOfFour	49	25207	25176	25225	Toby	"They have taken to a boat here." Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf. We took [MASK] round to each in turn, but, though he sniffed earnestly, he made no sign.
SignOfFour	57	25411	25359	25416	Jack	He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little, curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish, red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand. "You come back and be washed, [MASK]," she shouted.
SignOfFour	48	25453	25417	25465	Holmes	"Come back, you young imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he ll let us hear of it." "Dear little chap!" said [MASK], strategically. "What a rosy-cheeked young rascal!
SignOfFour	46	25468	25457	25503	Jack	"What a rosy-cheeked young rascal! Now, [MASK], is there anything you would like?" The youth pondered for a moment. "I d like a shillin ," said he. "Nothing you would like better?"
SignOfFour	48	25846	25826	25874	Holmes	What did he want always knockin about here for?" "A wooden-legged man?" said [MASK], with bland surprise. "Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that s called more n once for my old man.
SignOfFour	52	26032	26000	26052	Jim	He tapped at the winder, about three it would be. Show a leg, matey, says he: time to turn out guard. My old man woke up [MASK], that s my eldest, and away they went, without so much as a word to me.
SignOfFour	52	26307	26285	26337	Holmes	We shall take it and cross the river." "The main thing with people of that sort," said [MASK], as we sat in the sheets of the wherry, "is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you.
SignOfFour	51	26613	26613	26664	Jones	[MASK] s energy will be of use to us there, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent." "What are we to do, then?
SignOfFour	59	26723	26676	26735	Toby	"Take this hansom, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour s sleep. It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again. Stop at a telegraph-office, cabby! We will keep [MASK], for he may be of use to us yet."
SignOfFour	46	26749	26736	26782	Holmes	We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and [MASK] despatched his wire. "Whom do you think that is to?" he asked, as we resumed our journey. "I am sure I don t know."
SignOfFour	46	26851	26826	26872	Wiggins	If they fail, I have other resources; but I shall try them first. That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant, [MASK], and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast."
SignOfFour	43	27047	27026	27069	Holmes	Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that. If [MASK] could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure.
SignOfFour	48	27578	27570	27618	Holmes	"Isn t it gorgeous!" said [MASK], grinning over his coffee-cup. "What do you think of it?" "I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime." "So do I.
SignOfFour	47	27679	27675	27722	Holmes	"By heaven, [MASK]," I said, half rising, "I believe that they are really after us." "No, it s not quite so bad as that. It is the unofficial force, the Baker Street irregulars."
SignOfFour	41	27867	27858	27899	Wiggins	"In future they can report to you, [MASK], and you to me. I cannot have the house invaded in this way. However, it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions.
SignOfFour	49	28000	27977	28026	Wiggins	Let me know the moment you have news. Is that all clear?" "Yes, guv nor," said [MASK]. "The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat. Here s a day in advance.
SignOfFour	51	28074	28060	28111	Holmes	"If the launch is above water they will find her," said [MASK], as he rose from the table and lit his pipe. "They can go everywhere, see everything, overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her.
SignOfFour	57	28163	28157	28214	Holmes	Are you going to bed, [MASK]?" "No; I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never remember feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us.
SignOfFour	56	28681	28626	28682	Watson	The average height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this. They are a fierce, morose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained. Mark that, [MASK].
SignOfFour	44	28789	28746	28790	Watson	They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast. Nice, amiable people, [MASK]!
SignOfFour	50	29158	29127	29177	Wiggins	Have you had fresh news, then?" "Unfortunately, no. I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. I expected something definite by this time. [MASK] has just been up to report. He says that no trace can be found of the launch.
SignOfFour	48	29332	29312	29360	Holmes	They were anxious to hear what happened." "I would not tell them too much," said [MASK]. "Women are never to be entirely trusted, not the best of them." I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment.
SignOfFour	45	29399	29376	29421	Toby	"All right! Good luck! But, I say, if you are crossing the river you may as well return [MASK], for I don t think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now."
SignOfFour	46	29612	29609	29655	Mary	"Why, [MASK], your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don t think that you are nearly excited enough. Just imagine what it must be to be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!"
SignOfFour	44	30406	30381	30425	Wiggins	But surely, surely, we shall hear something." We did not, however. Not a word came to us either from [MASK] or from the other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy.
SignOfFour	53	30713	30690	30743	Wiggins	I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day, though [MASK] was despondent about it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to act on your own judgment if any news should come.
SignOfFour	55	31960	31910	31965	Poplar	I have had a wire from him this morning, by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business. Here is the message." He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me. It was dated from [MASK] at twelve o clock.
SignOfFour	55	32726	32680	32735	Jones	"We shall recompense you for the loss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have long to wait." He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face resting on his hands. [MASK] and I resumed our cigars and our talk.
SignOfFour	51	32786	32785	32836	Holmes	"[MASK]!" I exclaimed. "You here! But where is the old man?" "Here is the old man," said he, holding out a heap of white hair. "Here he is, wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all.
SignOfFour	46	32865	32823	32869	Jones	"Here he is, wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguise was pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test." "Ah, You rogue!" cried [MASK], highly delighted.
SignOfFour	53	33255	33215	33268	Watson	I think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. Let her be the first to open it. Eh, [MASK]?" "It would be a great pleasure to me."
SignOfFour	51	33277	33269	33320	Jones	"Rather an irregular proceeding," said [MASK], shaking his head. "However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at it. The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation." "Certainly.
SignOfFour	51	33494	33456	33507	Watson	"Only that I insist upon your dining with us. It will be ready in half an hour. I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a little choice in white wines. [MASK], you have never yet recognised my merits as a housekeeper."
SignOfFour	46	33522	33510	33556	Holmes	The End of the Islander Our meal was a merry one. [MASK] could talk exceedingly well when he chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant.
SignOfFour	42	33676	33652	33694	Holmes	For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of [MASK] s gaiety. None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.
SignOfFour	51	33701	33680	33731	Holmes	None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together. When the cloth was cleared, [MASK] glanced at his watch, and filled up three glasses with port. "One bumper," said he, "to the success of our little expedition.
SignOfFour	47	33747	33715	33762	Watson	"One bumper," said he, "to the success of our little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you a pistol, [MASK]?" "I have my old service-revolver in my desk."
SignOfFour	51	33819	33772	33823	Holmes	It is well to be prepared. I see that the cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six." It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and found our launch awaiting us. [MASK] eyed it critically.
SignOfFour	49	33954	33954	34003	Holmes	[MASK] smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us. "We ought to be able to catch anything on the river," he said. "Well, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us."
SignOfFour	51	34034	34004	34055	Watson	"We shall have to catch the _Aurora_, and she has a name for being a clipper. I will tell you how the land lies, [MASK]. You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?" "Yes."
SignOfFour	56	34493	34462	34518	Smith	It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They paid [MASK] well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box.
SignOfFour	59	34625	34579	34638	Small	"But the launch? They could not have taken that to their lodgings." "Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of [MASK], and looked at it as a man of his capacity would.
SignOfFour	55	35220	35210	35265	Smith	I think that it is a hundred to one against [MASK] knowing where they live. As long as he has liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions? They send him messages what to do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best."
SignOfFour	48	35418	35399	35447	Jones	"Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them," said [MASK], eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.
SignOfFour	54	35460	35448	35502	Holmes	"We have no right to take anything for granted," [MASK] answered. "It is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be certain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they can hardly see us.
SignOfFour	49	35736	35695	35744	Holmes	Surely there is a white flutter over yonder." "Yes, it is your boy," I cried. "I can see him plainly." "And there is the _Aurora_," exclaimed [MASK], "and going like the devil!
SignOfFour	49	35831	35811	35860	Jones	Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate. [MASK] looked gravely at her and shook his head. "She is very fast," he said. "I doubt if we shall catch her."
SignOfFour	50	35871	35851	35901	Holmes	"I doubt if we shall catch her." "We _must_ catch her!" cried [MASK], between his teeth. "Heap it on, stokers! Make her do all she can! If we burn the boat we must have them!"
SignOfFour	46	36082	36069	36115	Holmes	"Pile it on, men, pile it on!" cried [MASK], looking down into the engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager, aquiline face. "Get every pound of steam you can."
SignOfFour	54	36126	36106	36160	Jones	"Get every pound of steam you can." "I think we gain a little," said [MASK], with his eyes on the _Aurora_. "I am sure of it," said I. "We shall be up with her in a very few minutes."
SignOfFour	51	36320	36320	36371	Jones	[MASK] turned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees over which he stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog.
SignOfFour	55	36580	36531	36586	Jones	The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. [MASK] yelled to them to stop.
SignOfFour	50	36750	36721	36771	Holmes	It straightened itself into a little black man the smallest I have ever seen with a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. [MASK] had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature.
SignOfFour	47	36862	36818	36865	Holmes	His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury. "Fire if he raises his hand," said [MASK], quietly.
SignOfFour	49	37419	37413	37462	Holmes	"See here," said [MASK], pointing to the wooden hatchway. "We were hardly quick enough with our pistols." There, sure enough, just behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well.
SignOfFour	49	37476	37463	37512	Holmes	It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we fired. [MASK] smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night.
SignOfFour	56	37880	37844	37900	Holmes	I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not undo it again." "Have a cigar," said [MASK]; "and you had best take a pull out of my flask, for you are very wet.
SignOfFour	51	38201	38159	38210	Tonga	I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I d have half killed [MASK] for it if he had not scrambled off.
SignOfFour	48	38434	38413	38461	Holmes	Quite a family party," he remarked. "I think I shall have a pull at that flask, [MASK]. Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn t take the other alive; but there was no choice.
SignOfFour	51	38465	38436	38487	Holmes	Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn t take the other alive; but there was no choice. I say, [MASK], you must confess that you cut it rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her."
SignOfFour	45	38519	38518	38563	Smith	"[MASK] says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business."
SignOfFour	48	38865	38820	38868	Small	"It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first. You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?" "At the bottom of the river," said [MASK], shortly.
SignOfFour	46	38870	38869	38915	Hum	"[MASK]! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have had work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn you to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms.
SignOfFour	50	39757	39742	39792	Benares	"This is Indian work, I suppose?" "Yes; it is [MASK] metal-work." "And so heavy!" she exclaimed, trying to raise it. "The box alone must be of some value. Where is the key?"
SignOfFour	46	40397	40382	40428	Small	My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless expression, while [MASK] sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.
SignOfFour	50	40841	40797	40847	Small	However, there s no good grieving over it. I ve had ups in my life, and I ve had downs, but I ve learned not to cry over spilled milk." "This is a very serious matter, [MASK]," said the detective.
SignOfFour	52	42125	42091	42143	Dawson	There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and [MASK], who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and the managing.
SignOfFour	49	44712	44706	44755	Sahib	What say you to it, [MASK]? "In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn.
SignOfFour	44	44857	44854	44898	Sahib	" Consider, [MASK], said he, that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by the government, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them.
SignOfFour	47	46109	46067	46114	Holmes	I am telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favour or not." He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water which [MASK] had brewed for him.
SignOfFour	54	46347	46296	46350	Holmes	If he had got out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not very lenient at a time like that." "Go on with your story," said [MASK], shortly.
SignOfFour	56	46449	46431	46487	Achmet	The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left [MASK] the merchant there, having first covered him over with loose bricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure. "It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked.
SignOfFour	54	47095	47042	47096	Achmet	Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of [MASK].
SignOfFour	55	47227	47200	47255	Achmet	Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there himself next day, but could find no trace of [MASK]. This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant.
SignOfFour	56	48336	48321	48377	Small	" I wish to have your advice, major, said I. " Well, [MASK], what is it? he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips. " I wanted to ask you, sir, said I, who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over.
SignOfFour	58	48435	48378	48436	Small	I know where half a million worth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me. " Half a million, [MASK]?
SignOfFour	47	48649	48609	48656	Small	When I had finished he stood stock still and full of thought. I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him. " This is a very important matter, [MASK], he said, at last.
SignOfFour	53	49211	49174	49227	Small	I think we may very well trust him. " It s a dirty business, the other answered. Yet, as you say, the money would save our commissions handsomely. " Well, [MASK], said the major, we must, I suppose, try and meet you.
SignOfFour	50	49788	49753	49803	Sholto	and I nursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with me. I cared nothing for the law, nothing for the gallows. To escape, to track down [MASK], to have my hand upon his throat, that was my one thought.
SignOfFour	54	49822	49804	49858	Sholto	Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of [MASK]. "Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one which I did not carry out. But it was weary years before my time came.
SignOfFour	53	49994	49993	50046	Tonga	"[MASK] for that was his name was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomy canoe of his own. When I found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked it over with him.
SignOfFour	43	50361	50361	50404	Tonga	[MASK] had brought all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Among other things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nut matting, with which I made a sort of sail.
SignOfFour	49	50449	50442	50491	Tonga	They were a rum crowd, and [MASK] and I soon managed to settle down among them. They had one very good quality: they let you alone and asked no questions. "Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum
SignOfFour	56	51166	51166	51222	Tonga	[MASK] thought he had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope s end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp.
SignOfFour	44	51317	51293	51337	Smith	"I don t know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of [MASK] s launch the _Aurora_, so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape.
SignOfFour	51	51526	51518	51569	Tonga	By the way, I had hoped that [MASK] had lost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat." "He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe at the time."
SignOfFour	52	51578	51570	51622	Holmes	"Ah, of course," said [MASK]. "I had not thought of that." "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?" asked the convict, affably. "I think not, thank you," my companion answered.
SignOfFour	41	52241	52211	52252	Jones	"The division seems rather unfair," I remarked. "You have done all the work in this business. I get a wife out of it, [MASK] gets the credit, pray what remains for you?"
