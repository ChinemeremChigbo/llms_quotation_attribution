SenseAndSensibility	48	1717	1687	1735	Elinor	They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future. [MASK], too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she could exert herself.
SenseAndSensibility	57	2293	2281	2338	Fanny	"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear [MASK]; he only requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.
SenseAndSensibility	52	2505	2464	2516	Harry	If, indeed, it could be restored to our poor little boy " "Why, to be sure," said her husband, very gravely, "that would make great difference. The time may come when [MASK] will regret that so large a sum was parted with.
SenseAndSensibility	50	2976	2974	3024	Fanny	my dear [MASK]; her life cannot be worth half that purchase." "Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty.
SenseAndSensibility	46	4780	4753	4799	Elinor	It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition; and that [MASK] s merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.
SenseAndSensibility	44	5113	5083	5127	Elinor	He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation. She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a reflection which [MASK] chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister.
SenseAndSensibility	43	5157	5128	5171	Fanny	It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother. "It is enough," said she; "to say that he is unlike [MASK] is enough. It implies everything amiable. I love him already."
SenseAndSensibility	50	5182	5166	5216	Elinor	I love him already." "I think you will like him," said [MASK], "when you know more of him." "Like him!" replied her mother with a smile. "I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love."
SenseAndSensibility	55	5471	5419	5474	Edward	"My love, it will be scarcely a separation. We shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. You will gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother. I have the highest opinion in the world of [MASK] s heart.
SenseAndSensibility	50	5507	5507	5557	Edward	[MASK] is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet he is not the kind of young man there is something wanting his figure is not striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister.
SenseAndSensibility	50	5721	5711	5761	Edward	Oh! mama, how spiritless, how tame was [MASK] s manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat.
SenseAndSensibility	54	5814	5762	5816	Cowper	To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!" "He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose. I thought so at the time; but you _would_ give him [MASK]."
SenseAndSensibility	51	5841	5832	5883	Elinor	but we must allow for difference of taste. [MASK] has not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and be happy with him. But it would have broke _my_ heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.
SenseAndSensibility	48	5921	5917	5965	Edward	He must have all [MASK] s virtues, and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm." "Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness.
SenseAndSensibility	52	5982	5940	5992	Marianne	"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness. Why should you be less fortunate than your mother? In one circumstance only, my [MASK], may your destiny be different from hers!"
SenseAndSensibility	48	6286	6244	6292	Marianne	Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if _that_ were your opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him." [MASK] hardly knew what to say.
SenseAndSensibility	55	6329	6293	6348	Elinor	She would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible. At length she replied: "Do not be offended, [MASK], if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.
SenseAndSensibility	52	6408	6389	6441	Elinor	I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable." "I am sure," replied [MASK], with a smile, "that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that. I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly."
SenseAndSensibility	58	6463	6453	6511	Elinor	"Of his sense and his goodness," continued [MASK], "no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent.
SenseAndSensibility	46	6738	6729	6775	Elinor	"I shall very soon think him handsome, [MASK], if I do not now. When you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do in his heart."
SenseAndSensibility	52	6776	6746	6798	Elinor	When you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do in his heart." [MASK] started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.
SenseAndSensibility	46	6841	6837	6883	Marianne	She knew that what [MASK] and her mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next that with them, to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect. She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister.
SenseAndSensibility	54	6915	6870	6924	Marianne	She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister. "I do not attempt to deny," said she, "that I think very highly of him that I greatly esteem, that I like him." [MASK] here burst forth with indignation "Esteem him!
SenseAndSensibility	54	6961	6946	7000	Elinor	Use those words again, and I will leave the room this moment." [MASK] could not help laughing. "Excuse me," said she; "and be assured that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings.
SenseAndSensibility	49	7219	7219	7268	Marianne	[MASK] was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth. "And you really are not engaged to him!" said she. "Yet it certainly soon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay.
SenseAndSensibility	52	7280	7252	7304	Edward	"Yet it certainly soon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. _I_ shall not lose you so soon, and [MASK] will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.
SenseAndSensibility	44	7718	7684	7728	Elinor	She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved [MASK] should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.
SenseAndSensibility	43	13112	13088	13131	Elinor	He may live twenty years longer. But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony." "Perhaps," said [MASK], "thirty-five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together.
SenseAndSensibility	47	13323	13312	13359	Elinor	"It would be impossible, I know," replied [MASK], "to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.
SenseAndSensibility	43	13417	13407	13450	Marianne	"But he talked of flannel waistcoats," said [MASK]; "and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble."
SenseAndSensibility	46	13473	13451	13497	Marianne	"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him half so much. Confess, [MASK], is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?"
SenseAndSensibility	52	14303	14282	14334	Marianne	The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book, in spite of [MASK] s declaration that the day would be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off together.
SenseAndSensibility	41	14418	14418	14459	Margaret	[MASK] agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.
SenseAndSensibility	58	14988	14938	14996	Marianne	The honour was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain. His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised against [MASK] received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.
SenseAndSensibility	41	14997	14997	15038	Marianne	[MASK] herself had seen less of his person than the rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house.
SenseAndSensibility	48	15799	15764	15812	Marianne	"I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced from eight o clock till four, without once sitting down." "Did he indeed?" cried [MASK] with sparkling eyes, "and with elegance, with spirit?"
SenseAndSensibility	47	16892	16876	16923	Elinor	"My love," said her mother, "you must not be offended with [MASK] she was only in jest. I should scold her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend."
SenseAndSensibility	53	17054	17048	17101	Marianne	He was exactly formed to engage [MASK] s heart, for with all this, he joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.
SenseAndSensibility	43	17298	17298	17341	Willoughby	[MASK] was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities were strong.
SenseAndSensibility	49	17781	17770	17819	Elinor	"Do not boast of it, however," said [MASK], "for it is injustice in both of you. He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him."
SenseAndSensibility	54	17984	17940	17994	Marianne	"In defence of your _prot g _ you can even be saucy." "My _prot g _, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will always have attractions for me. Yes, [MASK], even in a man between thirty and forty.
SenseAndSensibility	46	18125	18120	18166	Willoughby	"Perhaps," said [MASK], "his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins." "I may venture to say that _his_ observations have stretched much further than _your_ candour.
SenseAndSensibility	45	18289	18275	18320	Elinor	"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass," replied [MASK], "and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the commendation _I_ am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid.
SenseAndSensibility	50	18740	18739	18789	Marianne	But [MASK] abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.
SenseAndSensibility	47	18790	18790	18837	Willoughby	[MASK] thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an illustration of their opinions. When he was present she had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he did, was right. Every thing he said, was clever.
SenseAndSensibility	48	19082	19040	19088	Norland	Her heart was not so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure. They afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach her to think of [MASK] with less regret than ever.
SenseAndSensibility	47	19206	19206	19253	Elinor	[MASK] needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do. Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired.
SenseAndSensibility	58	19753	19696	19754	Elinor	"This will probably be the case," he replied; "and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions." "I cannot agree with you there," said [MASK].
SenseAndSensibility	59	19763	19755	19814	Marianne	"There are inconveniences attending such feelings as [MASK] s, which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage."
SenseAndSensibility	42	20117	20116	20158	Marianne	But [MASK], in her place, would not have done so little. The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love. CHAPTER XII.
SenseAndSensibility	53	20362	20356	20409	Elinor	Imagine to yourself, my dear [MASK], the delight of a gallop on some of these downs." Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them.
SenseAndSensibility	43	20611	20569	20612	Willoughby	Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from [MASK].
SenseAndSensibility	52	20848	20822	20874	Marianne	His concern however was very apparent; and after expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice, "But, [MASK], the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now. I shall keep it only till you can claim it.
SenseAndSensibility	51	21207	21173	21224	Margaret	"But indeed this is quite another thing. I am sure they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair." "Take care, [MASK]. It may be only the hair of some great uncle of _his_."
SenseAndSensibility	55	22465	22421	22476	Colonel	It came from town, and is merely a letter of business." "But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business? Come, come, this won t do, [MASK]; so let us hear the truth of it."
SenseAndSensibility	55	22765	22742	22797	Brandon	"It shall not be put off when we are so near it. You cannot go to town till tomorrow, [MASK], that is all." "I wish it could be so easily settled. But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day!"
SenseAndSensibility	45	22946	22902	22947	Marianne	He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this trick for getting out of it. I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing." "I have no doubt of it," replied [MASK].
SenseAndSensibility	51	23265	23260	23311	Honiton	"No. Only to [MASK]. I shall then go post." "Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey. But you had better change your mind." "I assure you it is not in my power."
SenseAndSensibility	51	23577	23566	23617	Elinor	Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to [MASK], "She is his natural daughter." "Indeed!" "Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare. I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune."
SenseAndSensibility	49	24029	23986	24035	Marianne	It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you, I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago." [MASK] turned away in great confusion.
SenseAndSensibility	48	25245	25234	25282	Willoughby	It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and [MASK] on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all. As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both.
SenseAndSensibility	50	25308	25262	25312	Elinor	As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both. Why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, [MASK] could not imagine.
SenseAndSensibility	55	25762	25742	25797	Willoughby	May she always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better." "Thank you, [MASK]. But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world.
SenseAndSensibility	55	25932	25916	25971	Elinor	"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose," said [MASK]. "Yes," cried he in the same eager tone, "with all and every thing belonging to it; in no one convenience or inconvenience about it, should the least variation be perceptible.
SenseAndSensibility	45	27175	27171	27216	Willoughby	This was broken by [MASK], who said with a faint smile, "It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy."
SenseAndSensibility	45	27300	27300	27345	Willoughby	[MASK] s behaviour in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother s invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.
SenseAndSensibility	50	27446	27417	27467	Marianne	But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister s affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which [MASK] was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.
SenseAndSensibility	52	27649	27615	27667	Elinor	What can it be? Can they have quarrelled? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?" "It was not inclination that he wanted, [MASK]; I could plainly see _that_. He had not the power of accepting it.
SenseAndSensibility	49	27725	27710	27759	Elinor	I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way; but you, [MASK], who love to doubt where you can it will not satisfy _you_, I know; but you shall not talk _me_ out of my trust in it.
SenseAndSensibility	57	28187	28148	28205	Willoughby	There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body. [MASK] may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.
SenseAndSensibility	53	28213	28206	28259	Willoughby	But it would have been more like [MASK] to acknowledge them at once. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him." "Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the deviation is necessary.
SenseAndSensibility	50	28392	28381	28431	Elinor	"I want no proof of their affection," said [MASK]; "but of their engagement I do." "I am perfectly satisfied of both." "Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of them."
SenseAndSensibility	51	28450	28445	28496	Marianne	Has not his behaviour to [MASK] and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation? Have we not perfectly understood each other?
SenseAndSensibility	47	28518	28489	28536	Elinor	Have we not perfectly understood each other? Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate respect? My [MASK], is it possible to doubt their engagement? How could such a thought occur to you?
SenseAndSensibility	49	28544	28537	28586	Willoughby	How is it to be supposed that [MASK], persuaded as he must be of your sister s love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his affection; that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?"
SenseAndSensibility	47	28593	28587	28634	Elinor	"I confess," replied [MASK], "that every circumstance except _one_ is in favour of their engagement; but that _one_ is the total silence of both on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other."
SenseAndSensibility	48	28647	28641	28689	Willoughby	You must think wretchedly indeed of [MASK], if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together. Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time?
SenseAndSensibility	51	28886	28840	28891	Willoughby	But _I_ require no such proof. Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open and unreserved. You cannot doubt your sister s wishes. It must be [MASK] therefore whom you suspect.
SenseAndSensibility	43	28934	28892	28935	Elinor	But why? Is he not a man of honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?" "I hope not, I believe not," cried [MASK].
SenseAndSensibility	44	29185	29179	29223	Willoughby	"You speak very properly. [MASK] certainly does not deserve to be suspected. Though _we_ have not known him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?
SenseAndSensibility	46	29346	29342	29388	Marianne	They saw nothing of [MASK] till dinner time, when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word. Her eyes were red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty.
SenseAndSensibility	50	29472	29465	29515	Willoughby	The slightest mention of anything relative to [MASK] overpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if they spoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him.
SenseAndSensibility	44	30422	30390	30434	Marianne	We will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may be months, perhaps, before _that_ happens." "Months!" cried [MASK], with strong surprise. "No nor many weeks."
SenseAndSensibility	42	30482	30470	30512	Marianne	One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, [MASK] was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself. Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles.
SenseAndSensibility	51	30818	30793	30844	Marianne	The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air." "He has, he has," cried [MASK], "I am sure he has. His air, his coat, his horse. I knew how soon he would come."
SenseAndSensibility	57	30975	30957	31014	Willoughby	He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being [MASK]; the only one who could have gained a smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on _him_, and in her sister s happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.
SenseAndSensibility	50	31379	31363	31413	Marianne	The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves." "Oh," cried [MASK], "with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall! How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me by the wind!
SenseAndSensibility	52	31468	31427	31479	Elinor	Now there is no one to regard them. They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as possible from the sight." "It is not every one," said [MASK], "who has your passion for dead leaves."
SenseAndSensibility	48	31679	31646	31694	Marianne	"Because," replied he, smiling, "among the rest of the objects before me, I see a very dirty lane." "How strange!" said [MASK] to herself as she walked on. "Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?
SenseAndSensibility	43	31801	31801	31844	Elinor	[MASK] took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting from him occasional questions and remarks.
SenseAndSensibility	55	32016	31992	32047	Elinor	Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and [MASK] had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself. His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.
SenseAndSensibility	44	32342	32299	32343	Marianne	I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so." "Strange that it would!" cried [MASK].
SenseAndSensibility	59	32427	32422	32481	Elinor	"Perhaps," said [MASK], smiling, "we may come to the same point. _Your_ competence and _my_ wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting.
SenseAndSensibility	51	32517	32491	32542	Elinor	Come, what is your competence?" "About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than _that_." [MASK] laughed. "_two_ thousand a year! _one_ is my wealth! I guessed how it would end."
SenseAndSensibility	52	32559	32520	32572	Marianne	"_two_ thousand a year! _one_ is my wealth! I guessed how it would end." "And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income," said [MASK]. "A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.
SenseAndSensibility	51	33009	32982	33033	Edward	But I was willing to show you that I had not forgot our old disputes." "I love to be reminded of the past, [MASK] whether it be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it and you will never offend me by talking of former times.
SenseAndSensibility	47	33290	33244	33291	Marianne	You are not very gay yourself." "Why should you think so!" replied he, with a sigh. "But gaiety never was a part of _my_ character." "Nor do I think it a part of [MASK] s
SenseAndSensibility	42	33295	33292	33334	Elinor	," said [MASK]; "I should hardly call her a lively girl she is very earnest, very eager in all she does sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation but she is not often really merry."
SenseAndSensibility	59	33375	33361	33420	Elinor	"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes," said [MASK], "in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated.
SenseAndSensibility	49	33510	33495	33544	Marianne	This has always been your doctrine, I am sure." "No, [MASK], never. My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour. You must not confound my meaning.
SenseAndSensibility	53	33757	33743	33796	Edward	"She knows her own worth too well for false shame," replied [MASK]. "Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy."
SenseAndSensibility	56	33807	33759	33815	Marianne	"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy." "But you would still be reserved," said [MASK], "and that is worse."
SenseAndSensibility	47	33825	33821	33868	Marianne	Am I reserved, [MASK]?" "Yes, very." "I do not understand you," replied he, colouring. "Reserved! how, in what manner? What am I to tell you? What can you suppose?"
SenseAndSensibility	53	33869	33850	33903	Elinor	how, in what manner? What am I to tell you? What can you suppose?" [MASK] looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off the subject, she said to him, "Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means?
SenseAndSensibility	52	33931	33904	33956	Edward	Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?" [MASK] made no answer. His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent and he sat for some time silent and dull.
SenseAndSensibility	56	33960	33936	33992	Elinor	His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent and he sat for some time silent and dull. CHAPTER XVIII. [MASK] saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. His visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect.
SenseAndSensibility	57	34163	34163	34220	Edward	[MASK] returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situation than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had exceedingly pleased him.
SenseAndSensibility	45	34578	34570	34615	Marianne	"It is very true," said [MASK], "that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was.
SenseAndSensibility	44	34664	34657	34701	Edward	"I am convinced," said [MASK], "that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess.
SenseAndSensibility	59	36113	36061	36120	Willoughby	Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for [MASK] s service, by her mother.
SenseAndSensibility	49	36833	36803	36852	Edward	In feeling, in action, in condition, in every thing." "Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits, [MASK]. You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy.
SenseAndSensibility	55	37216	37198	37253	Marianne	Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no more meritorious to [MASK], than her own had seemed faulty to her. The business of self-command she settled very easily; with strong affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.
SenseAndSensibility	47	40109	40085	40132	Charlotte	"Ay, you may abuse me as you please," said the good-natured old lady, "you have taken [MASK] off my hands, and cannot give her back again. So there I have the whip hand of you."
SenseAndSensibility	46	40133	40122	40168	Charlotte	So there I have the whip hand of you." [MASK] laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her, as they must live together.
SenseAndSensibility	41	40249	40240	40281	Elinor	"He is always out of humour." [MASK] was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear.
SenseAndSensibility	57	40710	40701	40758	Charlotte	"How charming it will be," said [MASK], "when he is in Parliament! won t it? How I shall laugh! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M.P. But do you know, he says, he will never frank for me?
SenseAndSensibility	52	41297	41270	41322	Elinor	I am monstrous glad of it, for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know." "Upon my word," replied [MASK], "you know much more of the matter than I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match."
SenseAndSensibility	51	41962	41948	41999	Charlotte	"I am so glad we are got acquainted at last," continued [MASK]. "And now I hope we shall always be great friends. You can t think how much I longed to see you! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage!
SenseAndSensibility	54	42853	42810	42864	Lucy	It was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself. "Do come now," said he "pray come you must come I declare you shall come You can t think how you will like them. [MASK] is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable!
SenseAndSensibility	53	43511	43504	43557	Annamaria	"And here is my sweet little [MASK]," she added, tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the last two minutes; "And she is always so gentle and quiet Never was there such a quiet little thing!"
SenseAndSensibility	53	43898	43878	43931	Marianne	"It might have been a very sad accident." "Yet I hardly know how," cried [MASK], "unless it had been under totally different circumstances. But this is the usual way of heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality."
SenseAndSensibility	52	44116	44078	44130	Elinor	I never saw such fine children in my life. I declare I quite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children." "I should guess so," said [MASK], with a smile, "from what I have witnessed this morning.
SenseAndSensibility	51	44368	44355	44406	Elinor	"I think every one _must_ admire it," replied [MASK], "who ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do." "And had you a great many smart beaux there?
SenseAndSensibility	59	44674	44667	44726	Elinor	"Upon my word," replied [MASK], "I cannot tell you, for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word. But this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him."
SenseAndSensibility	56	44750	44695	44751	Lord	But this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him." "Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men s being beaux they have something else to do." "[MASK]!
SenseAndSensibility	51	44821	44806	44857	Elinor	The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as [MASK] was not blinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want of real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish of knowing them better.
SenseAndSensibility	48	45543	45515	45563	Elinor	"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle s, it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well." [MASK] heard all this with attention and surprise. "And who was this uncle? Where did he live?
SenseAndSensibility	45	46684	46681	46726	Lucy	She turned towards [MASK] in silent amazement, unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.
SenseAndSensibility	50	47000	46996	47046	Elinor	"Yes." [MASK], though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it. "I did not know," said she, "that you were even acquainted till the other day." "Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.
SenseAndSensibility	51	47428	47421	47472	Elinor	"It is strange," replied [MASK], in a most painful perplexity, "that I should never have heard him even mention your name." "No; considering our situation, it was not strange. Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.
SenseAndSensibility	50	47535	47531	47581	Elinor	She was silent. [MASK] s security sunk; but her self-command did not sink with it. "Four years you have been engaged," said she with a firm voice. "Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait.
SenseAndSensibility	48	47735	47716	47764	Lucy	She returned it almost instantly, acknowledging the likeness. "I have never been able," continued [MASK], "to give him my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so anxious to get it!
SenseAndSensibility	59	47801	47801	47860	Lucy	[MASK] spoke first. "I am sure," said she, "I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say.
SenseAndSensibility	51	47889	47878	47929	Elinor	"I certainly did not seek your confidence," said [MASK]; "but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on. Your secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication.
SenseAndSensibility	43	48088	48066	48109	Edward	Besides in the present case, I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about [MASK] s mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask.
SenseAndSensibility	41	48110	48110	48151	Anne	[MASK] is the only person that knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her betraying me.
SenseAndSensibility	56	48231	48218	48274	Edward	I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for [MASK] s sake these last four years. Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom we can hardly meet above twice a-year. I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke."
SenseAndSensibility	50	48283	48239	48289	Elinor	Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom we can hardly meet above twice a-year. I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke." Here she took out her handkerchief; but [MASK] did not feel very compassionate.
SenseAndSensibility	44	48295	48290	48334	Lucy	"Sometimes." continued [MASK], after wiping her eyes, "I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely." As she said this, she looked directly at her companion. "
SenseAndSensibility	46	48661	48616	48662	Lucy	" She remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to their names. "Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?" repeated [MASK].
SenseAndSensibility	50	49053	49035	49085	Elinor	Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?" "I did," said [MASK], with a composure of voice, under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before. She was mortified, shocked, confounded.
SenseAndSensibility	54	49383	49347	49401	Edward	Her resentment of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time made her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose. Had [MASK] been intentionally deceiving her? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel?
SenseAndSensibility	48	49406	49389	49437	Lucy	Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel? Was his engagement to [MASK] an engagement of the heart? No; whatever it might once have been, she could not believe it such at present. His affection was all her own.
SenseAndSensibility	53	51071	51049	51102	Elinor	They quitted it only with the removal of the tea-things. The card-table was then placed, and [MASK] began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park. They all rose up in preparation for a round game.
SenseAndSensibility	59	51377	51371	51430	Marianne	No one made any objection but [MASK], who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility, exclaimed, "Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse _me_ you know I detest cards. I shall go to the piano-forte; I have not touched it since it was tuned."
SenseAndSensibility	45	51893	51882	51927	Elinor	CHAPTER XXIV. In a firm, though cautious tone, [MASK] thus began. "I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its subject.
SenseAndSensibility	48	51946	51940	51988	Lucy	"Thank you," cried [MASK] warmly, "for breaking the ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday." "Offended me!
SenseAndSensibility	53	52000	51989	52042	Elinor	How could you suppose so? Believe me," and [MASK] spoke it with the truest sincerity, "nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea. Could you have a motive for the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?"
SenseAndSensibility	58	52053	52024	52082	Lucy	Could you have a motive for the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?" "And yet I do assure you," replied [MASK], her little sharp eyes full of meaning, "there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable.
SenseAndSensibility	41	52386	52358	52399	Edward	We must wait, it may be for many years. With almost every other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect; but [MASK] s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know."
SenseAndSensibility	55	52724	52685	52740	Elinor	I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived." "All this," thought [MASK], "is very pretty; but it can impose upon neither of us."
SenseAndSensibility	53	53442	53418	53471	Lucy	"Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little." They were again silent for many minutes. At length [MASK] exclaimed with a deep sigh, "I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement.
SenseAndSensibility	51	53520	53515	53566	Elinor	"No," answered [MASK], with a smile, which concealed very agitated feelings, "on such a subject I certainly will not. You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes."
SenseAndSensibility	44	54480	54480	54524	Elinor	[MASK], without observing the varying complexion of her sister, and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations.
SenseAndSensibility	46	54631	54599	54645	Betty	Don t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I shan t put myself at all out of my way for you. It will only be sending [MASK] by the coach, and I hope I can afford _that_.
SenseAndSensibility	54	55037	55023	55077	Marianne	"I thank you, ma am, sincerely thank you," said [MASK], with warmth: "your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it.
SenseAndSensibility	46	55094	55078	55124	Elinor	But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother, I feel the justice of what [MASK] has urged, and if she were to be made less happy, less comfortable by our absence Oh! no, nothing should tempt me to leave her.
SenseAndSensibility	48	55687	55675	55723	Elinor	"Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness," said [MASK], "you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion, cannot be so easily removed."
SenseAndSensibility	51	56500	56500	56551	Marianne	[MASK] s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone. Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.
SenseAndSensibility	57	56561	56525	56582	Elinor	Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive. Her mother s affliction was hardly less, and [MASK] was the only one of the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal.
SenseAndSensibility	55	57427	57406	57461	Marianne	This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity. [MASK] s was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity.
SenseAndSensibility	50	57846	57831	57881	Marianne	She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even observed [MASK] as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself. "Is your sister ill?" said he.
SenseAndSensibility	48	57882	57872	57920	Elinor	"Is your sister ill?" said he. [MASK] answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister s behaviour.
SenseAndSensibility	52	58458	58458	58510	Ay	[MASK], it is a fine thing to be young and handsome. Well! I was young once, but I never was very handsome worse luck for me. However, I got a very good husband, and I don t know what the greatest beauty can do more.
SenseAndSensibility	50	58527	58526	58576	Colonel	But [MASK], where have you been to since we parted? And how does your business go on? Come, come, let s have no secrets among friends." He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but without satisfying her in any.
SenseAndSensibility	50	58642	58622	58672	Marianne	No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed. [MASK] rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks. The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that day.
SenseAndSensibility	48	59234	59195	59243	Elinor	The man replied that none had. "How very odd!" said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she turned away to the window. "How odd, indeed!" repeated [MASK] within herself, regarding her sister with uneasiness.
SenseAndSensibility	49	59640	59611	59660	Marianne	Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem to take it so much to heart." "That is true," cried [MASK], in a cheerful voice, and walking to the window as she spoke, to examine the day.
SenseAndSensibility	45	60060	60046	60091	Elinor	"Don t you find it colder than it was in the morning, [MASK]? There seems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff. It was not so yesterday, I think.
SenseAndSensibility	54	60259	60244	60298	Elinor	Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected, [MASK] was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.
SenseAndSensibility	54	60505	60496	60550	Elinor	This event, while it raised the spirits of [MASK], restored to those of her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. From this moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing.
SenseAndSensibility	43	60763	60757	60800	Marianne	"Nor I," answered [MASK] with energy, "our situations then are alike. We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do not communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing."
SenseAndSensibility	48	61347	61323	61371	Marianne	"When do you go back again?" "I do not know." And thus ended their discourse. Never had [MASK] been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise.
SenseAndSensibility	51	62230	62194	62245	Elinor	Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if concealment be possible, is all that remains." These words, which conveyed to [MASK] a direct avowal of his love for her sister, affected her very much.
SenseAndSensibility	41	62936	62914	62955	Marianne	She soon caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to her, or to approach [MASK], though he could not but see her; and then continued his discourse with the same lady.
SenseAndSensibility	51	63049	63021	63072	Elinor	Oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?" "Pray, pray be composed," cried [MASK], "and do not betray what you feel to every body present. Perhaps he has not observed you yet."
SenseAndSensibility	53	63098	63064	63117	Marianne	Perhaps he has not observed you yet." This however was more than she could believe herself; and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of [MASK], it was beyond her wish. She sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature.
SenseAndSensibility	49	63251	63251	63300	Willoughby	[MASK], what is the meaning of this? Have you not received my letters? Will you not shake hands with me?" He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.
SenseAndSensibility	47	63312	63276	63323	Elinor	He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment. During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure. [MASK] watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil.
SenseAndSensibility	46	63389	63368	63414	Marianne	My card was not lost, I hope." "But have you not received my notes?" cried [MASK] in the wildest anxiety. "Here is some mistake I am sure some dreadful mistake. What can be the meaning of it?
SenseAndSensibility	47	63651	63609	63656	Marianne	I cannot rest I shall not have a moment s peace till this is explained some dreadful misapprehension or other. Oh, go to him this moment." "How can that be done? No, my dearest [MASK], you must wait.
SenseAndSensibility	51	64357	64354	64405	Elinor	"No, [MASK]," she replied, "ask nothing; you will soon know all." The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no longer than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction.
SenseAndSensibility	54	64459	64406	64460	Willoughby	It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to [MASK].
SenseAndSensibility	53	65198	65147	65200	Charlotte	Because you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such thing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever so long. I tell every body of it and so does [MASK]."
SenseAndSensibility	47	65209	65201	65248	Elinor	"Indeed, Ma am," said [MASK], very seriously, "you are mistaken. Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now."
SenseAndSensibility	47	66447	66442	66489	Marianne	"Exert yourself, dear [MASK]," she cried, "if you would not kill yourself and all who love you. Think of your mother; think of her misery while _you_ suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself."
SenseAndSensibility	57	66501	66466	66523	Marianne	Think of your mother; think of her misery while _you_ suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself." "I cannot, I cannot," cried [MASK]; "leave me, leave me, if I distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me!
SenseAndSensibility	46	66645	66603	66649	Edward	"Forgive me, forgive me," throwing her arms round her sister s neck; "I know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you are you must be happy; [MASK] loves you what,
SenseAndSensibility	53	66683	66674	66727	Marianne	"No, no, no," cried [MASK] wildly, "he loves you, and only you. You _can_ have no grief." "I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state." "And you will never see me otherwise.
SenseAndSensibility	51	66746	66704	66755	Marianne	"I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state." "And you will never see me otherwise. Mine is a misery which nothing can do away." "You must not talk so, [MASK]. Have you no comforts? no friends?
SenseAndSensibility	52	66846	66821	66873	Marianne	Every additional day of unhappy confidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful." "Engagement!" cried [MASK], "there has been no engagement." "No engagement!" "No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him.
SenseAndSensibility	49	66952	66932	66981	Elinor	"Yes: could that be wrong after all that had passed? But I cannot talk." [MASK] said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the contents of all.
SenseAndSensibility	51	67324	67280	67331	Willoughby	But I will not suppose this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise. "M.D." The contents of her last note to him were these: "What am I to imagine, [MASK], by your behaviour last night?
SenseAndSensibility	52	67756	67716	67768	Elinor	"I felt myself," she added, "to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other." "I can believe it," said [MASK]; "but unfortunately he did not feel the same."
SenseAndSensibility	59	67778	67769	67828	Elinor	"He _did_ feel the same, [MASK] for weeks and weeks he felt it. I know he did. Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish.
SenseAndSensibility	48	68080	68080	68128	Elinor	[MASK] would not contend, and only replied, "Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits.
SenseAndSensibility	54	68149	68129	68183	Marianne	It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence." "No, no," cried [MASK], "misery such as mine has no pride. I care not who knows that I am wretched. The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world.
SenseAndSensibility	48	68375	68367	68415	Elinor	Cruel, cruel nothing can acquit you. [MASK], nothing can. Whatever he might have heard against me ought he not to have suspended his belief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power of clearing myself?
SenseAndSensibility	55	68440	68396	68451	Willoughby	ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power of clearing myself? The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,) which you so obligingly bestowed on me That is unpardonable. [MASK], where was your heart when you wrote those words?
SenseAndSensibility	48	68468	68465	68513	Marianne	"No, [MASK], in no possible way." "And yet this woman who knows what her art may have been? how long it may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her! Who is she? Who can she be?
SenseAndSensibility	51	68551	68509	68560	Marianne	Who can she be? Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance? Oh! no one, no one he talked to me only of myself." Another pause ensued; [MASK] was greatly agitated, and it ended thus.
SenseAndSensibility	42	69208	69180	69222	Marianne	She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she supposed her young friend s affliction could be increased by noise. [MASK], to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with them.
SenseAndSensibility	51	69458	69453	69504	Marianne	Their good friend saw that [MASK] was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so. She treated her therefore, with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays.
SenseAndSensibility	53	69610	69593	69646	Marianne	As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on [MASK], she could stay no longer. With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room.
SenseAndSensibility	52	69692	69672	69724	Lord	And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine! And the dried cherries too! [MASK]! nothing seems to do her any good. I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I would send all over the town for it.
SenseAndSensibility	53	69766	69725	69778	Lord	Well, it is the oddest thing to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there is plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, [MASK] bless you! they care no more about such things! "
SenseAndSensibility	48	70245	70211	70259	Marianne	What shall we play at? She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for?" "Dear ma am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. [MASK], I dare say, will not leave her room again this evening.
SenseAndSensibility	48	70306	70306	70354	Lord	[MASK]! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that. And so the letter that came today finished it! Poor soul!
SenseAndSensibility	44	70925	70897	70941	Lord	He will have her at last; aye, that he will. Mind me, now, if they an t married by Mid-summer. [MASK]! how he ll chuckle over this news! I hope he will come tonight.
SenseAndSensibility	55	71367	71340	71395	Elinor	"You had better leave me," was all the notice that her sister received from her. "I will leave you," said [MASK], "if you will go to bed." But this, from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first refused to do.
SenseAndSensibility	46	71414	71396	71442	Elinor	Her sister s earnest, though gentle persuasion, however, soon softened her to compliance, and [MASK] saw her lay her aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her.
SenseAndSensibility	47	71599	71594	71641	Marianne	But I have just left [MASK] in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me leave, I will drink the wine myself."
SenseAndSensibility	52	71855	71811	71863	Marianne	He knows nothing of it; do tell him, my dear." He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after her sister. "[MASK] is not well," said she.
SenseAndSensibility	46	72295	72288	72334	Willoughby	"It may be so; but [MASK] is capable at least I think" he stopped a moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, "And your sister how did she " "Her sufferings have been very severe.
SenseAndSensibility	56	72844	72844	72900	Elinor	[MASK] had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner.
SenseAndSensibility	45	74033	73989	74034	Elinor	I think I am justified though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?" He stopped. "I understand you," said [MASK].
SenseAndSensibility	52	74067	74053	74105	Marianne	Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown [MASK]. _My_ gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end, and _hers_ must be gained by it in time. Pray, pray let me hear it."
SenseAndSensibility	58	74284	74279	74337	Elinor	"Indeed," answered [MASK], "I have _not_ forgotten it." He looked pleased by this remembrance, and added, "If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well in mind as person.
SenseAndSensibility	48	74404	74393	74441	Eliza	I cannot remember the time when I did not love [MASK]; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable of having ever felt.
SenseAndSensibility	54	74988	74951	75005	Elinor	It was _that_ which threw this gloom, even now the recollection of what I suffered " He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room. [MASK], affected by his relation, and still more by his distress, could not speak.
SenseAndSensibility	57	75436	75428	75485	Elinor	Again he stopped to recover himself; and [MASK] spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate friend. "Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended," said he, "by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation.
SenseAndSensibility	48	76316	76286	76334	Elinor	He had left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor relieved her." "This is beyond every thing!" exclaimed [MASK]. "His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse than both.
SenseAndSensibility	50	76870	76851	76901	Elinor	"Yes," he replied gravely, "once I have. One meeting was unavoidable." [MASK], startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously, saying, "What? have you met him to " "I could meet him no other way.
SenseAndSensibility	45	76902	76902	76947	Eliza	[MASK] had confessed to me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he to defend, I to punish his conduct.
SenseAndSensibility	56	78830	78807	78863	Marianne	His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which [MASK] sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him. _
SenseAndSensibility	51	79099	79070	79121	Marianne	She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she was desirous that [MASK] should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every morning.
SenseAndSensibility	57	79477	79445	79502	Elinor	And now to be sure you will be in no _hurry_ to be gone. I am amazingly glad you did not keep to _your word_." [MASK] perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her self-command to make it appear that she did _not_.
SenseAndSensibility	48	79694	79689	79737	Nancy	here comes your beau, [MASK], my cousin said t other day, when she saw him crossing the street to the house. My beau, indeed! said I I cannot think who you mean. The Doctor is no beau of mine."
SenseAndSensibility	57	80038	79984	80041	Lucy	My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation." "Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as [MASK] and me!
SenseAndSensibility	55	80063	80042	80097	Elinor	I think she might see _us;_ and I am sure we would not speak a word." [MASK], with great civility, declined the proposal. Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore not able to come to them.
SenseAndSensibility	49	80401	80365	80414	Elinor	All that could be done was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is probable that [MASK] was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch.
SenseAndSensibility	45	80730	80730	80775	Elinor	[MASK] lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side. She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother.
SenseAndSensibility	41	80890	80890	80931	Harry	[MASK] was vastly pleased. _This_ morning I had fully intended to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so much to do on first coming to town.
SenseAndSensibility	46	80938	80895	80941	Fanny	_This_ morning I had fully intended to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to bespeak [MASK] a seal.
SenseAndSensibility	52	81120	81104	81156	Edward	And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing! [MASK] brought us a most charming account of the place: the most complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing.
SenseAndSensibility	51	81517	81499	81550	Elinor	"I am glad of it. He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think, [MASK], I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life." "Me, brother! what do you mean?" "He likes you.
SenseAndSensibility	54	81605	81571	81625	Elinor	"I believe about two thousand a year." "Two thousand a-year;" and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity, he added, "[MASK], I wish with all my heart it were _twice_ as much, for your sake."
SenseAndSensibility	51	81662	81657	81708	Elinor	"You are mistaken, [MASK]; you are very much mistaken. A very little trouble on your side secures him. Perhaps just at present he may be undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his friends may all advise him against it.
SenseAndSensibility	44	81889	81861	81905	Fanny	Recollecting himself, however, he added, "That is, I mean to say your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled; [MASK] particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you.
SenseAndSensibility	41	81965	81947	81988	Fanny	"It would be something remarkable, now," he continued, "something droll, if [MASK] should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time. And yet it is not very unlikely."
SenseAndSensibility	50	82172	82132	82182	Fanny	To give you another instance of her liberality: The other day, as soon as we came to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes into [MASK] s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds.
SenseAndSensibility	58	82320	82295	82353	Gibson	And then I have made a little purchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where old [MASK] used to live. The land was so very desirable for me in every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it my duty to buy it.
SenseAndSensibility	55	82630	82625	82680	Elinor	"Certainly," said [MASK]; "and assisted by her liberality, I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances." "Another year or two may do much towards it," he gravely replied; "but however there is still a great deal to be done.
SenseAndSensibility	55	82688	82652	82707	Fanny	"Another year or two may do much towards it," he gravely replied; "but however there is still a great deal to be done. There is not a stone laid of [MASK] s green-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden marked out."
SenseAndSensibility	53	83303	83264	83317	September	"I am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever! Hers has been a very short one! She was as handsome a girl last [MASK], as I ever saw; and as likely to attract the man.
SenseAndSensibility	50	83334	83318	83368	Fanny	There was something in her style of beauty, to please them particularly. I remember [MASK] used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of _you_, but so it happened to strike her.
SenseAndSensibility	48	83379	83369	83417	Marianne	She will be mistaken, however. I question whether [MASK] _now_, will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if _you_ do not do better.
SenseAndSensibility	52	86383	86371	86423	Elinor	who knows, or who cares, for her? it is [MASK] of whom _we_ think and speak." And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law s hands, to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.
SenseAndSensibility	50	86669	86641	86691	Elinor	Don t let them make _you_ unhappy." She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her face on [MASK] s shoulder, she burst into tears. Every body s attention was called, and almost every body was concerned.
SenseAndSensibility	50	87704	87667	87717	Elinor	I should be sorry to have _you_ ill; you, that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world! Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship." [MASK] tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.
SenseAndSensibility	47	87879	87849	87896	Elinor	They are such charming women! I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her, you cannot speak too high." But [MASK] would not give her any encouragement to hope that she _should_ tell her sister.
SenseAndSensibility	47	88069	88044	88091	Edward	It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each showed that it was so. They all looked exceedingly foolish; and [MASK] seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to advance farther into it.
SenseAndSensibility	47	88145	88136	88183	Lucy	The ladies recovered themselves first. It was not [MASK] s business to put herself forward, and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up. She could therefore only _look_ her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him, said no more.
SenseAndSensibility	41	88327	88298	88339	Lucy	She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes of [MASK], though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.
SenseAndSensibility	48	88636	88612	88660	Edward	She met him with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister. "Dear [MASK]!" she cried, "this is a moment of great happiness! This would almost make amends for every thing!"
SenseAndSensibility	45	88661	88639	88684	Edward	she cried, "this is a moment of great happiness! This would almost make amends for every thing!" [MASK] tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt.
SenseAndSensibility	52	88803	88766	88818	Elinor	"Oh, don t think of me!" she replied with spirited earnestness, though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, "don t think of _my_ health. [MASK] is well, you see. That must be enough for us both."
SenseAndSensibility	50	88896	88873	88923	Edward	"Not at all. I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none. The sight of you, [MASK], is the only comfort it has afforded; and thank Heaven! you are what you always were!" She paused no one spoke.
SenseAndSensibility	47	89117	89071	89118	Edward	And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in private. "But why were you not there, [MASK]?
SenseAndSensibility	49	89303	89275	89324	Edward	He is the most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body I ever saw. [MASK], it is so, and I will say it. What! are you never to hear yourself praised!
SenseAndSensibility	47	89389	89353	89400	Edward	The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to [MASK], that he very soon got up to go away.
SenseAndSensibility	55	91542	91531	91586	Edward	Happy had it been for her, if her regard for [MASK] had depended less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations! For then his brother s bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun.
SenseAndSensibility	48	92280	92238	92286	Elliott	There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be? _I_ immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it, so I said, My dear Lady [MASK], do not be uneasy.
SenseAndSensibility	45	92551	92512	92557	Fanny	The expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father. [MASK] was startled at the proposal.
SenseAndSensibility	54	93549	93521	93575	Lord	She was sure it was very ill it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples. So I looked at it directly, and, [MASK]! my dear, says I, it is nothing in the world, but the red gum; and nurse said just the same.
SenseAndSensibility	50	93903	93891	93941	Nancy	And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter, except [MASK]! Could you have believed such a thing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another; but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody suspect it! _
SenseAndSensibility	50	94731	94695	94745	Betty	how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my [MASK] has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly."
SenseAndSensibility	49	95060	95012	95061	Edward	No time was to be lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth, and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others, without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any resentment against [MASK].
SenseAndSensibility	47	95249	95210	95257	Marianne	Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief. _That_ belonged rather to the hearer, for [MASK] listened with horror, and cried excessively.
SenseAndSensibility	41	95459	95459	95500	Marianne	[MASK] s feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.
SenseAndSensibility	42	95526	95501	95543	Elinor	The first question on her side, which led to farther particulars, was, "How long has this been known to you, [MASK]? has he written to you?" "I have known it these four months.
SenseAndSensibility	49	95602	95602	95651	Elinor	[MASK] confirmed it. "What! while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your heart? And I have reproached you for being happy!" "It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!"
SenseAndSensibility	50	95658	95634	95684	Marianne	"It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!" "Four months!" cried [MASK] again. "So calm! so cheerful! How have you been supported?" "By feeling that I was doing my duty.
SenseAndSensibility	59	95688	95685	95744	Lucy	My promise to [MASK], obliged me to be secret. I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to satisfy."
SenseAndSensibility	53	95745	95696	95749	Marianne	I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to satisfy." [MASK] seemed much struck.
SenseAndSensibility	51	95765	95750	95801	Elinor	"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother," added [MASK]; "and once or twice I have attempted it; but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced you." "Four months! and yet you loved him!"
SenseAndSensibility	43	95910	95871	95914	Edward	I have many things to support me. I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther. I acquit [MASK] of essential misconduct.
SenseAndSensibility	54	95950	95915	95969	Lucy	I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret, in the end he must become so. [MASK] does not want sense, and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.
SenseAndSensibility	55	95974	95970	96025	Marianne	And after all, [MASK], after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment, and all that can be said of one s happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is not meant it is not fit it is not possible that it should be so.
SenseAndSensibility	52	96078	96067	96119	Marianne	"If such is your way of thinking," said [MASK], "if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be wondered at.
SenseAndSensibility	57	96149	96145	96202	Marianne	For four months, [MASK], I have had all this hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.
SenseAndSensibility	44	96469	96467	96511	Marianne	No, [MASK]. _Then_, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what I owed to my dearest friends from openly showing that I was _very_ unhappy."
SenseAndSensibility	47	96512	96472	96519	Marianne	Then_, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what I owed to my dearest friends from openly showing that I was _very_ unhappy." [MASK] was quite subdued. "Oh!
SenseAndSensibility	57	96520	96520	96577	Elinor	[MASK]," she cried, "you have made me hate myself for ever. How barbarous have I been to you! you, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only suffering for me! Is this my gratitude?
SenseAndSensibility	55	96817	96808	96863	Elinor	Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made [MASK] feel equal to any thing herself. The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair, and bring them news of his wife.
SenseAndSensibility	53	96981	96965	97018	Donavan	she was in hysterics all yesterday. But I would not alarm you too much. [MASK] says there is nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolution equal to any thing. She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an angel!
SenseAndSensibility	48	97154	97137	97185	Fanny	And now to be so rewarded! I wish, with all my heart, says poor [MASK] in her affectionate way, that we had asked your sisters instead of them. " Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.
SenseAndSensibility	50	97316	97270	97320	Edward	_There_, to be sure, said she, I might have thought myself safe. She was quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should be done, and at last she determined to send for [MASK]. He came.
SenseAndSensibility	44	97626	97610	97654	Edward	"All this, however," he continued, "was urged in vain. [MASK] said very little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner. Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement.
SenseAndSensibility	44	99470	99434	99478	Lucy	"I cannot suppose it possible that she should be." "I am monstrous glad of it. Good gracious! I have had such a time of it! I never saw [MASK] in such a rage in my life.
SenseAndSensibility	53	99648	99616	99669	Elinor	My cousins have been so plaguing me! I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them." She had wandered away to a subject on which [MASK] had nothing to say, and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first.
SenseAndSensibility	52	100320	100314	100366	Lucy	But, to be sure, [MASK] would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and love, you know, and all that Oh, la! one can t repeat such kind of things you know)
SenseAndSensibility	47	100627	100611	100658	Laughing	Oh, for shame! To be sure you must know better than that. ([MASK] affectedly.) No, no; they were shut up in the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at the door."
SenseAndSensibility	52	100664	100631	100683	Elinor	No, no; they were shut up in the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at the door." "How!" cried [MASK]; "have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door?
SenseAndSensibility	48	101071	101030	101078	Edward	Good gracious! (giggling as she spoke) I d lay my life I know what my cousins will say, when they hear of it. They will tell me I should write to the Doctor, to get [MASK] the curacy of his new living.
SenseAndSensibility	48	101134	101107	101155	Elinor	I wonder how you could think of such a thing? _I_ write to the Doctor, indeed! " "Well," said [MASK], "it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst. You have got your answer ready."
SenseAndSensibility	48	101687	101677	101725	Lord	Then they will have a child every year! and [MASK] help em! how poor they will be! I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house. Two maids and two men, indeed! as I talked of t other day.
SenseAndSensibility	55	101740	101697	101752	Betty	I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house. Two maids and two men, indeed! as I talked of t other day. No, no, they must get a stout girl of all works. [MASK] s sister would never do for them _now_."
SenseAndSensibility	50	101918	101877	101927	Edward	We have had great trials, and great persecutions, but however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge many friends, yourself not the least among them, whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember, as will [MASK] too, who I have told of it.
SenseAndSensibility	49	102303	102274	102323	Lucy	"Very well indeed! how prettily she writes! aye, that was quite proper to let him be off if he would. That was just like [MASK]. Poor soul! I wish I _could_ get him a living, with all my heart.
SenseAndSensibility	53	103330	103318	103371	Marianne	Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval of [MASK] s turning from one lesson to another, some words of the Colonel s inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house. This set the matter beyond a doubt.
SenseAndSensibility	46	103459	103439	103485	Marianne	They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another lucky stop in [MASK] s performance brought her these words in the Colonel s calm voice, "I am afraid it cannot take place very soon."
SenseAndSensibility	45	103506	103486	103531	Lord	Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost ready to cry out, "[MASK]! what should hinder it?" but checking her desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation. "This is very strange!
SenseAndSensibility	49	103760	103754	103803	Elinor	Is it so?;" [MASK] told him that it was. "The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty," he replied, with great feeling, "of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long attached to each other, is terrible.
SenseAndSensibility	51	104049	104022	104073	Elinor	Such as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting it to him, will be very great. Pray assure him of it." [MASK] s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand.
SenseAndSensibility	43	104088	104074	104117	Edward	The preferment, which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for [MASK], was already provided to enable him to marry; and _she_, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!
SenseAndSensibility	51	104195	104183	104234	Edward	She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of [MASK] s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another.
SenseAndSensibility	49	104929	104918	104967	Lord	I never was more astonished in my life." "[MASK]! my dear, you are very modest. I an t the least astonished at it in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more likely to happen."
SenseAndSensibility	51	105288	105246	105297	Marianne	I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must long to tell your sister all about it." [MASK] had left the room before the conversation began.
SenseAndSensibility	47	105695	105654	105701	Charlotte	However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to write.) You know your own concerns best. So goodby, my dear. I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since [MASK] was brought to bed."
SenseAndSensibility	57	105721	105702	105759	Betty	And away she went; but returning again in a moment, "I have just been thinking of [MASK] s sister, my dear. I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do for a lady s maid, I am sure I can t tell.
SenseAndSensibility	45	105795	105774	105819	Elinor	However, you will think of all that at your leisure." "Certainly, ma am," replied [MASK], not hearing much of what she said, and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.
SenseAndSensibility	50	106259	106248	106298	Elinor	"You would not have gone, however," said [MASK], recovering herself, and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible, "without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them in person.
SenseAndSensibility	49	107043	107043	107092	Edward	[MASK] made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her a look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house much greater.
SenseAndSensibility	46	107452	107447	107493	Elinor	"Really," said [MASK], "I know so little of these kind of forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination."
SenseAndSensibility	52	107852	107805	107857	Lucy	and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage! It seems quite ridiculous. But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before [MASK] goes to it."
SenseAndSensibility	51	108417	108412	108463	Elinor	The consequence was, that [MASK] set out by herself to pay a visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run the risk of a t te- -t te with a woman, whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike.
SenseAndSensibility	49	108543	108542	108591	Fanny	"[MASK] is in her own room, I suppose," said he: "I will go to her presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing _you_. Very far from it, indeed.
SenseAndSensibility	56	108889	108873	108929	Edward	I suppose, however on recollection that the case may probably be _this_. [MASK] is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to take it. Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it."
SenseAndSensibility	46	109364	109363	109409	Edward	When [MASK] s unhappy match takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible.
SenseAndSensibility	52	109578	109568	109620	Robert	"Certainly, there can be no difference; for [MASK] will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son; and as to any thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that one is superior to the other."
SenseAndSensibility	56	109927	109895	109951	Elinor	But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I knew how much it must please you. Not that you have any reason to regret, my dear [MASK]. There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well, quite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered.
SenseAndSensibility	46	111027	111012	111058	Elinor	But though _she_ never spoke of it out of her own family, [MASK] could see its influence on her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.
SenseAndSensibility	43	113847	113833	113876	Elinor	The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though [MASK] tried to raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she _then_ really believed herself, that it would be a very short one.
SenseAndSensibility	50	115705	115680	115730	Elinor	Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to [MASK], her conviction of her sister s danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved.
SenseAndSensibility	51	116217	116211	116262	Hope	But it was too late. [MASK] had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter, she bent over her sister to watch she hardly knew for what. Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her. Others even arose to confirm it.
SenseAndSensibility	50	116442	116442	116492	Marianne	[MASK] restored to life, health, friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude; but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words, no smiles.
SenseAndSensibility	52	116495	116493	116545	Elinor	All within [MASK] s breast was satisfaction, silent and strong. She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every look and every breath.
SenseAndSensibility	53	117065	117060	117113	Elinor	Never in her life had [MASK] found it so difficult to be calm, as at that moment. The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door of her doubt her dread perhaps her despair! and of what _she_ had to tell!
SenseAndSensibility	57	117517	117489	117546	Elinor	He took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by either. "Pray be quick, sir," said [MASK], impatiently; "I have no time to spare." He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to hear her.
SenseAndSensibility	50	117589	117589	117639	Elinor	[MASK] would not speak. He repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness. "For God s sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?" "We hope she is." He rose up, and walked across the room.
SenseAndSensibility	42	117730	117697	117739	Elinor	I am in a fine mood for gaiety. Tell me honestly" a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks, "do you think me most a knave or a fool?" [MASK] looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.
SenseAndSensibility	54	118182	118169	118223	Marianne	"If that is all, you may be satisfied already; for [MASK] _does_, she has _long_ forgiven you." "Has she?" he cried, in the same eager tone. "Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it.
SenseAndSensibility	50	118247	118201	118251	Elinor	he cried, in the same eager tone. "Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it. But she shall forgive me again, and on more reasonable grounds. _Now_ will you listen to me?" [MASK] bowed her assent.
SenseAndSensibility	48	118897	118890	118938	Elinor	"You did then," said [MASK], a little softened, "believe yourself at one time attached to her?" "To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness! Is there a man on earth who could have done it?
SenseAndSensibility	52	119294	119288	119340	Elinor	"I have," returned [MASK], colouring likewise, and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him, "I have heard it all. And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess is beyond my comprehension."
SenseAndSensibility	45	119346	119317	119362	Willoughby	And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess is beyond my comprehension." "Remember," cried [MASK], "from whom you received the account. Could it be an impartial one?
SenseAndSensibility	47	119846	119816	119863	Eliza	By one measure I might have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry [MASK]. That could not be and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house.
SenseAndSensibility	51	119903	119900	119951	Marianne	My affection for [MASK], my thorough conviction of her attachment to me it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased.
SenseAndSensibility	48	120048	120025	120073	Marianne	But whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate. To see [MASK], I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution.
SenseAndSensibility	57	120403	120403	120460	Elinor	[MASK] first spoke. "Did you tell her that you should soon return?" "I do not know what I told her," he replied, impatiently; "less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future.
SenseAndSensibility	42	120491	120461	120503	Heaven	I cannot think of it. It won t do. Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence. Thank [MASK]! it _did_ torture me. I was miserable.
SenseAndSensibility	53	120625	120587	120640	Barton	My journey to town travelling with my own horses, and therefore so tediously no creature to speak to my own reflections so cheerful when I looked forward every thing so inviting! when I looked back at [MASK], the picture so soothing! oh, it was a blessed journey!"
SenseAndSensibility	51	120651	120644	120695	Elinor	"Well, sir," said [MASK], who, though pitying him, grew impatient for his departure, "and this is all?" "All! no: have you forgot what passed in town? That infamous letter? Did she show it you?"
SenseAndSensibility	54	120795	120765	120819	Marianne	Every line, every word was in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here, would forbid a dagger to my heart. To know that [MASK] was in town was in the same language a thunderbolt. Thunderbolts and daggers! what a reproof would she have given me!
SenseAndSensibility	57	121452	121444	121501	Marianne	The next morning brought another short note from [MASK] still affectionate, open, artless, confiding everything that could make _my_ conduct most hateful. I could not answer it. I tried but could not frame a sentence. But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.
SenseAndSensibility	51	121687	121669	121720	Marianne	I ran away from you all as soon as I could; but not before I had seen [MASK] s sweet face as white as death. _That_ was the last, last look I ever had of her; the last manner in which she appeared to me.
SenseAndSensibility	48	121798	121769	121817	Willoughby	She was before me, constantly before me, as I travelled, in the same look and hue." A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded. [MASK] first rousing himself, broke it thus: "Well, let me make haste and be gone.
SenseAndSensibility	56	121932	121904	121960	Sophia	I was breakfasting at the Ellisons, and her letter, with some others, was brought to me there from my lodgings. It happened to catch [MASK] s eye before it caught mine and its size, the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether, immediately gave her a suspicion.
SenseAndSensibility	45	122409	122384	122429	Madam	And the lock of hair that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now searched by [MASK] with the most ingratiating virulence, the dear lock, all, every memento was torn from me."
SenseAndSensibility	54	122538	122523	122577	Marianne	To treat her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to [MASK] nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience." "Do not talk to me of my wife," said he with a heavy sigh; "she does not deserve your compassion.
SenseAndSensibility	49	123215	123170	123219	Elinor	_One_ person I was sure would represent me as capable of anything What I felt was dreadful! My resolution was soon made, and at eight o clock this morning I was in my carriage. Now you know all." [MASK] made no answer.
SenseAndSensibility	54	123306	123306	123360	Vanity	[MASK], while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to punishment.
SenseAndSensibility	55	123698	123653	123708	Marianne	If, however, I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it may be the means it may put me on my guard at least, it may be something to live for. [MASK] to be sure is lost to me for ever.
SenseAndSensibility	50	123720	123709	123759	Elinor	Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again " [MASK] stopped him with a reproof. "Well," he replied "once more good bye. I shall now go away and live in dread of one event." "What do you mean?"
SenseAndSensibility	54	123869	123869	123923	Elinor	[MASK], for some time after he left her, for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness was the general result, to think even of her sister.
SenseAndSensibility	49	125640	125631	125680	Marianne	I_ value and esteem him, that if [MASK] can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world. What answer did you give him? Did you allow him to hope?
SenseAndSensibility	51	125701	125667	125718	Marianne	What answer did you give him? Did you allow him to hope?" "Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself. [MASK] might at that moment be dying. But he did not ask for hope or encouragement.
SenseAndSensibility	50	125874	125872	125922	Marianne	He thinks [MASK] s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her.
SenseAndSensibility	45	126003	125975	126020	Willoughby	And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not so handsome as [MASK]; but at the same time, there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.
SenseAndSensibility	41	126676	126648	126689	Marianne	, saw nothing in the Colonel s behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the actions and words of [MASK] she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned.
SenseAndSensibility	54	127084	127040	127094	Elinor	Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. To [MASK], the observation of the latter was particularly grateful.
SenseAndSensibility	50	127403	127381	127431	Willoughby	She went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera, procured for her by [MASK], containing some of their favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand-writing. That would not do.
SenseAndSensibility	59	127520	127493	127552	Margaret	On the contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of [MASK] s return, and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.
SenseAndSensibility	54	127794	127794	127848	Elinor	[MASK] honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self-control.
SenseAndSensibility	53	128141	128102	128155	Elinor	Her voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added, "I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot! shall we ever talk on that subject, [MASK]?" hesitatingly it was said. "Or will it be wrong?
SenseAndSensibility	49	128190	128183	128232	Marianne	"As for regret," said [MASK], "I have done with that, as far as _he_ is concerned. I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him, but what they are _now_.
SenseAndSensibility	52	128497	128485	128537	Marianne	"I am not wishing him too much good," said [MASK] at last with a sigh, "when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own. He will suffer enough in them." "Do you compare your conduct with his?"
SenseAndSensibility	52	128582	128577	128629	Elinor	Do not, my dearest [MASK], let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My illness has made me think. It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly able to reflect.
SenseAndSensibility	41	129181	129168	129209	Elinor	Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and [MASK], impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved.
SenseAndSensibility	45	129210	129210	129255	Marianne	[MASK] pressed her hand and replied, "You are very good. The future must be my proof. I have laid down my plan, and if I am capable of adhering to it my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved.
SenseAndSensibility	45	129282	129256	129301	Margaret	They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself. I shall now live solely for my family. You, my mother, and [MASK], must henceforth be all the world to me; you will share my affections entirely between you.
SenseAndSensibility	54	129366	129364	129418	Willoughby	As for [MASK] to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle. His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions. But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason, by constant employment."
SenseAndSensibility	44	129548	129548	129592	Marianne	[MASK] said not a word. She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the ground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one.
SenseAndSensibility	50	129846	129797	129847	Marianne	She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt; she was sorry for him; she wished him happy. But the feelings of the past could not be recalled. Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken a character unblemished, to [MASK].
SenseAndSensibility	59	130038	130027	130086	Marianne	In the evening, when they were all three together, [MASK] began voluntarily to speak of him again; but that it was not without an effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting her rising colour, as she spoke, and her unsteady voice, plainly showed.
SenseAndSensibility	53	130302	130262	130315	Marianne	I know it," cried her mother. "Happy with a man of libertine practices! With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends, and the best of men! No my [MASK] has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!
SenseAndSensibility	51	130801	130759	130810	Elinor	His own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle." "It is very true. _My_ happiness never was his object." "At present," continued [MASK], "he regrets what he has done.
SenseAndSensibility	54	131927	131917	131971	Thomas	"But did she tell you she was married, [MASK]?" "Yes, ma am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts. She was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady, and very civil behaved.
SenseAndSensibility	50	132204	132204	132254	Elinor	[MASK] looked as if she wished to hear more. "Did you see them off, before you came away?" "No, ma am the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late."
SenseAndSensibility	49	132783	132774	132823	Lucy	But she soon saw how likely it was that [MASK], in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay. They were married, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle
SenseAndSensibility	55	133324	133287	133342	Marianne	I _will_ be calm; I _will_ be mistress of myself." In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake. She saw her mother and [MASK] change colour; saw them look at herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other.
SenseAndSensibility	55	133453	133399	133454	Elinor	They all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor. His footsteps were heard along the gravel path; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before them. His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for [MASK].
SenseAndSensibility	51	134297	134292	134343	Elinor	It was only to ask [MASK] to marry him; and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in need of encouragement and fresh air.
SenseAndSensibility	42	135106	135106	135148	Marianne	[MASK] could speak _her_ happiness only by tears. Comparisons would occur regrets would arise; and her joy, though sincere as her love for her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language.
SenseAndSensibility	43	135150	135117	135160	Elinor	Comparisons would occur regrets would arise; and her joy, though sincere as her love for her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language. But [MASK] how are _her_ feelings to be described?
SenseAndSensibility	44	135601	135601	135645	Edward	[MASK] could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps, at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.
SenseAndSensibility	42	135693	135686	135728	Robert	"_That_ was exactly like [MASK]," was his immediate observation. "And _that_," he presently added, "might perhaps be in _his_ head when the acquaintance between them first began.
SenseAndSensibility	50	135730	135702	135752	Lucy	And _that_," he presently added, "might perhaps be in _his_ head when the acquaintance between them first began. And [MASK] perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour. Other designs might afterward arise."
SenseAndSensibility	58	135853	135824	135882	Lucy	Not the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed; and when at last it burst on him in a letter from [MASK] herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.
SenseAndSensibility	44	136132	136096	136140	Elinor	"I have burnt all your letters, and will return your picture the first opportunity. Please to destroy my scrawls but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep." [MASK] read and returned it without any comment.
SenseAndSensibility	50	136156	136141	136191	Edward	"I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition," said [MASK]. "For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by _you_ in former days. In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!
SenseAndSensibility	53	136285	136280	136333	Robert	The independence she settled on [MASK], through resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his own choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do.
SenseAndSensibility	49	136408	136377	136426	Edward	She will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner." In what state the affair stood at present between them, [MASK] knew not, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him.
SenseAndSensibility	48	137915	137898	137946	Lucy	Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive. No rumour of [MASK] s marriage had yet reached him: he knew nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.
SenseAndSensibility	44	138777	138755	138799	Robert	"A letter of proper submission!" repeated he; "would they have me beg my mother s pardon for [MASK] s ingratitude to _her_, and breach of honour to _me?_ I can make no submission.
SenseAndSensibility	51	138851	138840	138891	Elinor	"You may certainly ask to be forgiven," said [MASK], "because you have offended; and I should think you might _now_ venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger."
SenseAndSensibility	44	140449	140434	140478	Lucy	In that point, however, and that only, he erred; for though [MASK] soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in _time_, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to produce this conviction.
SenseAndSensibility	59	140727	140713	140772	Robert	But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self-condemnation for [MASK] s offence, and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.
