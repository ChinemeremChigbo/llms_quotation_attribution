NightAndDay	56	317	292	348	Katharine	At the very same moment, rather to her amusement, the door was flung open, and a young man entered the room. [MASK], as she shook hands with him, asked him, in her own mind, "Now, do you think we re enjoying ourselves enormously?"... "
NightAndDay	43	1706	1706	1749	Denham	[MASK] noticed that, although silent, she kept sufficient control of the situation to answer immediately her mother appealed to her for help, and yet it was obvious to him that she attended only with the surface skin of her mind.
NightAndDay	55	1797	1750	1805	Manchester	It struck him that her position at the tea-table, among all these elderly people, was not without its difficulties, and he checked his inclination to find her, or her attitude, generally antipathetic to him. The talk had passed over [MASK], after dealing with it very generously.
NightAndDay	46	2699	2677	2723	Katharine	The paint had so faded that very little but the beautiful large eyes were left, dark in the surrounding dimness. [MASK] waited as though for him to receive a full impression, and then she said: "This is his writing-table.
NightAndDay	54	2789	2759	2813	Katharine	There lay the gigantic gold-rimmed spectacles, ready to his hand, and beneath the table was a pair of large, worn slippers, one of which [MASK] picked up, remarking: "I think my grandfather must have been at least twice as large as any one is nowadays.
NightAndDay	49	2842	2814	2863	Winter	This," she went on, as if she knew what she had to say by heart, "is the original manuscript of the Ode to [MASK]. The early poems are far less corrected than the later. Would you like to look at it?"
NightAndDay	43	3089	3077	3120	Alardyce	And then, let me see oh, that s the original [MASK], 1697, the founder of the family fortunes, with his wife. Some one gave us this bowl the other day because it has their crest and initials.
NightAndDay	53	3482	3475	3528	Katharine	"Yes, I am," [MASK] answered, and she added, "Do you think there s anything wrong in that?" "Wrong? How should it be wrong? It must be a bore, though, showing your things to visitors," he added reflectively.
NightAndDay	51	3567	3529	3580	Katharine	"Not if the visitors like them." "Isn t it difficult to live up to your ancestors?" he proceeded. "I dare say I shouldn t try to write poetry," [MASK] replied. "No. And that s what I should hate.
NightAndDay	44	3724	3724	3768	Denham	[MASK] smiled, in a peculiarly provoking way. He was amused and gratified to find that he had the power to annoy his oblivious, supercilious hostess, if he could not impress her; though he would have preferred to impress her.
NightAndDay	48	3786	3769	3817	Katharine	He sat silent, holding the precious little book of poems unopened in his hands, and [MASK] watched him, the melancholy or contemplative expression deepening in her eyes as her annoyance faded. She appeared to be considering many things. She had forgotten her duties.
NightAndDay	48	3823	3804	3852	Denham	She appeared to be considering many things. She had forgotten her duties. "Well," said [MASK] again, suddenly opening the little book of poems, as though he had said all that he meant to say or could, with propriety, say.
NightAndDay	52	4294	4294	4346	Denham	[MASK] looked at her as she sat in her grandfather s arm-chair, drawing her great-uncle s malacca cane smoothly through her fingers, while her background was made up equally of lustrous blue-and-white paint, and crimson books with gilt lines on them.
NightAndDay	47	4801	4790	4837	Denham	"No, we haven t any great men," [MASK] replied. "I m very glad that we haven t. I hate great men. The worship of greatness in the nineteenth century seems to me to explain the worthlessness of that generation."
NightAndDay	51	5316	5266	5317	Katharine	He is so eloquent and so witty, so searching and so profound that, after half an hour or so, I feel inclined to turn out all the lights. But perhaps he d be more wonderful than ever in the dark. What d you think, [MASK]?
NightAndDay	56	5408	5399	5455	Katharine	I must lie down for a little, and [MASK] must change her dress (though she s wearing a very pretty one), but if you don t mind being left alone, supper will be at eight. I dare say you ll write a poem of your own while you re waiting.
NightAndDay	48	7158	7157	7205	Denham	After [MASK] had waited some minutes, in the course of which neither he nor the rook took their eyes off the fire, he muttered a curse, ran downstairs, intercepted the parlor-maid, and cut himself a slice of bread and cold meat.
NightAndDay	42	7227	7226	7268	Ralph	but [MASK] paid no attention to the voice, and made off upstairs with his plate. He set it down in a chair opposite him, and ate with a ferocity that was due partly to anger and partly to hunger.
NightAndDay	54	7537	7497	7551	Ralph	That was his own affair; that, indeed, was a step entirely in the right direction, and, lighting his pipe, and cutting up the remains of his meal for the benefit of the rook, [MASK] calmed his rather excessive irritation and settled down to think over his prospects.
NightAndDay	53	8223	8222	8275	Ralph	But [MASK] was conscious of a distinct wish to be interrupted, and his disappointment was perceptible when he heard the creaking sound rather farther down the stairs, as if his visitor had decided to withdraw. He rose, opened the door with unnecessary abruptness, and waited on the landing.
NightAndDay	41	8296	8295	8336	Joan	"[MASK]?" "I was coming up, but I saw your notice." "Well, come along in, then." He concealed his desire beneath a tone as grudging as he could make it.
NightAndDay	52	8337	8322	8374	Joan	He concealed his desire beneath a tone as grudging as he could make it. [MASK] came in, but she was careful to show, by standing upright with one hand upon the mantelpiece, that she was only there for a definite purpose, which discharged, she would go.
NightAndDay	57	8419	8414	8471	Ralph	Her pleasant brown eyes resembled [MASK] s, save in expression, for whereas he seemed to look straightly and keenly at one object, she appeared to be in the habit of considering everything from many different points of view. This made her appear his elder by more years than existed in fact between them.
NightAndDay	46	8548	8510	8556	Ralph	She says she can t afford to pay for him after this term. She says she ll have to ask for an overdraft as it is." "That s simply not true," said [MASK]. "No. I thought not.
NightAndDay	51	8569	8550	8601	Ralph	"No. I thought not. But she won t believe me when I say it." [MASK], as if he could foresee the length of this familiar argument, drew up a chair for his sister and sat down himself. "I m not interrupting?"
NightAndDay	51	8605	8595	8646	Ralph	"I m not interrupting?" she inquired. [MASK] shook his head, and for a time they sat silent. The lines curved themselves in semicircles above their eyes. "She doesn t understand that one s got to take risks," he observed, finally.
NightAndDay	51	8658	8618	8669	Charles	The lines curved themselves in semicircles above their eyes. "She doesn t understand that one s got to take risks," he observed, finally. "I believe mother would take risks if she knew that [MASK] was the sort of boy to profit by it."
NightAndDay	57	8682	8670	8727	Ralph	"He s got brains, hasn t he?" said [MASK]. His tone had taken on that shade of pugnacity which suggested to his sister that some personal grievance drove him to take the line he did. She wondered what it might be, but at once recalled her mind, and assented.
NightAndDay	53	8759	8711	8764	Molly	She wondered what it might be, but at once recalled her mind, and assented. "In some ways he s fearfully backward, though, compared with what you were at his age. And he s difficult at home, too. He makes [MASK] slave for him."
NightAndDay	41	8779	8775	8816	Joan	It was plain to [MASK] that she had struck one of her brother s perverse moods, and he was going to oppose whatever his mother said. He called her "she," which was a proof of it.
NightAndDay	48	8825	8817	8865	Ralph	She sighed involuntarily, and the sigh annoyed [MASK], and he exclaimed with irritation: "It s pretty hard lines to stick a boy into an office at seventeen!" "Nobody _wants_ to stick him into an office," she said.
NightAndDay	55	9012	9001	9056	Joan	"I don t think that for a moment," [MASK] replied quickly, repenting of her annoyance. "The question, to my mind, is, whether we couldn t cut down our expenses in some way." "A smaller house?" "Fewer servants, perhaps."
NightAndDay	52	9083	9044	9096	Ralph	"A smaller house?" "Fewer servants, perhaps." Neither brother nor sister spoke with much conviction, and after reflecting for a moment what these proposed reforms in a strictly economical household meant, [MASK] announced very decidedly: "It s out of the question."
NightAndDay	48	9236	9198	9246	Joan	"She ought to look upon it as an investment; but if she won t, we must find some other way, that s all." A threat was contained in this sentence, and [MASK] knew, without asking, what the threat was.
NightAndDay	58	9292	9276	9334	Joan	Considering the sacrifices he had made in order to put by this sum it always amazed [MASK] to find that he used it to gamble with, buying shares and selling them again, increasing it sometimes, sometimes diminishing it, and always running the risk of losing every penny of it in a day s disaster.
NightAndDay	41	9367	9367	9408	Ralph	[MASK] interested her more than any one else in the world, and she often broke off in the middle of one of these economic discussions, in spite of their gravity, to consider some fresh aspect of his character.
NightAndDay	45	9423	9409	9454	Charles	"I think you d be foolish to risk your money on poor old [MASK]," she observed. "Fond as I am of him, he doesn t seem to me exactly brilliant.... Besides, why should you be sacrificed?"
NightAndDay	53	9565	9529	9582	Joan	We shall just turn round in the mill every day of our lives until we drop and die, worn out, as most people do, when one comes to think of it." [MASK] looked at him, opened her lips as if to speak, and closed them again.
NightAndDay	56	10043	10008	10064	Joan	The infinite dreariness and sordidness of their life oppressed him in spite of his fundamental belief that, as a family, they were somehow remarkable. "Shall you talk to mother?" [MASK] inquired. "Because, you see, the thing s got to be settled, one way or another.
NightAndDay	47	10114	10082	10129	Joan	"I suppose it doesn t much matter either way," he exclaimed. "He s doomed to misery in the long run." A slight flush came into [MASK] s cheek. "You know you re talking nonsense," she said.
NightAndDay	50	10156	10156	10206	Ralph	[MASK] was pleased that she should feel this, and wished her to continue, but he went on, perversely enough. "Isn t that only because you ve forgotten how to enjoy yourself? You never have time for anything decent " "As for instance?"
NightAndDay	57	10381	10375	10432	Joan	Why, he wondered, could [MASK] never for one moment detach her mind from the details of domestic life? It seemed to him that she was getting more and more enmeshed in them, and capable of shorter and less frequent flights into the outer world, and yet she was only thirty-three.
NightAndDay	50	10543	10494	10544	Joan	"You think your sister s getting very old and very dull that s it, isn t it?" "I don t think anything of the kind," he said stoutly, but he flushed. "But you lead a dog s life, [MASK].
NightAndDay	48	10577	10576	10624	Joan	" [MASK] rose, and stood for a moment warming her hands, and, apparently, meditating as to whether she should say anything more or not. A feeling of great intimacy united the brother and sister, and the semicircular lines above their eyebrows disappeared.
NightAndDay	55	10638	10605	10660	Joan	A feeling of great intimacy united the brother and sister, and the semicircular lines above their eyebrows disappeared. No, there was nothing more to be said on either side. [MASK] brushed her brother s head with her hand as she passed him, murmured good night, and left the room.
NightAndDay	53	10668	10661	10714	Ralph	For some minutes after she had gone [MASK] lay quiescent, resting his head on his hand, but gradually his eyes filled with thought, and the line reappeared on his brow, as the pleasant impression of companionship and ancient sympathy waned, and he was left to think on alone.
NightAndDay	53	11996	11949	12002	Richard	These formidable old creatures used to take her in their arms, look very keenly in her eyes, and then to bless her, and tell her that she must mind and be a good girl, or detect a look in her face something like [MASK] s as a small boy.
NightAndDay	51	12733	12700	12751	Katharine	Not in their materials, alas! nor in their ambitions, but in something more profound, in her own inaptitude, and above all, in her mother s temperament. [MASK] would calculate that she had never known her write for more than ten minutes at a time.
NightAndDay	54	13480	13453	13507	Katharine	But, as you say, the great thing is to finish the book. Now let me see " When they inspected her manuscripts, which [MASK] had put in order, they found a state of things well calculated to dash their spirits, if they had not just resolved on reform.
NightAndDay	48	14500	14500	14548	Katharine	[MASK], thus, was a member of a very great profession which has, as yet, no title and very little recognition, although the labor of mill and factory is, perhaps, no more severe and the results of less benefit to the world.
NightAndDay	51	15907	15907	15958	Mary	[MASK] was led to think of the heights of a Sussex down, and the swelling green circle of some camp of ancient warriors. The moonlight would be falling there so peacefully now, and she could fancy the rough pathway of silver upon the wrinkled skin of the sea.
NightAndDay	49	16615	16569	16618	Ralph	How horrid of you! But I m afraid you re much more remarkable than I am. You ve done much more than I ve done." "If that s your standard, you ve nothing to be proud of," said [MASK] grimly. "
NightAndDay	49	16724	16708	16757	Mary	The combination is very odd." But it seemed to recommend itself to him. [MASK] gave a little laugh, expressive of happiness, and the particular stitches that she was now putting into her work appeared to her to be done with singular grace and felicity.
NightAndDay	51	16815	16769	16820	Emerson	"You always say that," she said. "I assure you it s a common combination, as you call it, in the houses of the clergy. The only thing that s odd about me is that I enjoy them both [MASK] and the stocking."
NightAndDay	57	17004	16993	17050	Mary	He described the scene with certain additions and exaggerations which interested [MASK] very much. "But, in spite of what you say, I do admire her," she said. "I ve only seen her once or twice, but she seems to me to be what one calls a personality. "
NightAndDay	59	17084	17027	17086	Rodney	"I ve only seen her once or twice, but she seems to me to be what one calls a personality. " "I didn t mean to abuse her. I only felt that she wasn t very sympathetic to me." "They say she s going to marry that queer creature [MASK]."
NightAndDay	51	17114	17091	17142	Mary	Then she must be more deluded than I thought her." "Now that s my door, all right," [MASK] exclaimed, carefully putting her wools away, as a succession of knocks reverberated unnecessarily, accompanied by a sound of people stamping their feet and laughing.
NightAndDay	41	17174	17143	17184	Denham	A moment later the room was full of young men and women, who came in with a peculiar look of expectation, exclaimed "Oh!" when they saw [MASK], and then stood still, gaping rather foolishly.
NightAndDay	48	17998	17991	18039	Katharine	You must answer their questions," [MASK] whispered, desiring, at all costs, to keep him quiet. Oddly enough, when the speaker was no longer in front of them, there seemed to be much that was suggestive in what he had said.
NightAndDay	54	18115	18098	18152	Katharine	He s misunderstood every word I said!" "Well then, answer him," [MASK] whispered back. "No, I shan t! They d only laugh at me. Why did I let you persuade me that these sort of people care for literature?" he continued.
NightAndDay	52	18564	18542	18594	Katharine	He was lying back against the wall, with his eyes apparently shut, and his chin sunk upon his collar. [MASK] was turning over the pages of his manuscript as if she were looking for some passage that had particularly struck her, and had a difficulty in finding it.
NightAndDay	51	18692	18679	18730	Rodney	"Will you lend me the manuscript to read in peace?" [MASK], who had opened his eyes on their approach, regarded her for a moment in suspicious silence. "Do you say that merely to disguise the fact of my ridiculous failure?" he asked.
NightAndDay	46	18731	18712	18758	Katharine	"Do you say that merely to disguise the fact of my ridiculous failure?" he asked. [MASK] looked up from her reading with a smile. "He says he doesn t mind what we think of him," she remarked. "
NightAndDay	49	18788	18741	18790	Rodney	"He says he doesn t mind what we think of him," she remarked. "He says we don t care a rap for art of any kind." "I asked her to pity me, and she teases me!" [MASK] exclaimed.
NightAndDay	46	18919	18907	18953	Denham	"It was a very suggestive paper." She turned to [MASK] for confirmation, and he corroborated her. "It s the ten minutes after a paper is read that proves whether it s been a success or not," he said.
NightAndDay	42	18960	18928	18970	Rodney	"It s the ten minutes after a paper is read that proves whether it s been a success or not," he said. "If I were you, [MASK], I should be very pleased with myself."
NightAndDay	47	19537	19494	19541	Katharine	But as it fell in accurately with his conception of life that all one s desires were bound to be frustrated, he concentrated his mind upon literature, and determined, philosophically, to get what he could out of that. [MASK] was pleasantly excited.
NightAndDay	52	19593	19551	19603	Rodney	She knew several people slightly, and at any moment one of them might rise from the floor and come and speak to her; on the other hand, she might select somebody for herself, or she might strike into [MASK] s discourse, to which she was intermittently attentive.
NightAndDay	51	19701	19670	19721	Katharine	"They re exactly like a flock of sheep, aren t they?" she said, referring to the noise that rose from the scattered bodies beneath her. [MASK] turned and smiled. "I wonder what they re making such a noise about?" she said.
NightAndDay	50	19771	19760	19810	Mary	"I wonder why men always talk about politics?" [MASK] speculated. "I suppose, if we had votes, we should, too." "I dare say we should. And you spend your life in getting us votes, don t you?"
NightAndDay	47	19817	19774	19821	Mary	"I suppose, if we had votes, we should, too." "I dare say we should. And you spend your life in getting us votes, don t you?" "I do," said [MASK], stoutly. "
NightAndDay	43	19869	19864	19907	Mary	She connected him vaguely with [MASK]. "I suppose you re one of the people who think we should all have professions," she said, rather distantly, as if feeling her way among the phantoms of an unknown world.
NightAndDay	48	19915	19871	19919	Mary	"I suppose you re one of the people who think we should all have professions," she said, rather distantly, as if feeling her way among the phantoms of an unknown world. "Oh dear no," said [MASK] at once. "
NightAndDay	49	19928	19919	19968	Katharine	"Well, I think I do," [MASK] continued, with half a sigh. "You will always be able to say that you ve done something, whereas, in a crowd like this, I feel rather melancholy." "In a crowd?
NightAndDay	47	20084	20071	20118	Katharine	They knew each other so slightly that the beginning of intimacy, which [MASK] seemed to initiate by talking about herself, had something solemn in it, and they were silent, as if to decide whether to proceed or not. They tested the ground.
NightAndDay	44	20133	20114	20158	Katharine	They tested the ground. "Ah, but I want to trample upon their prostrate bodies!" [MASK] announced, a moment later, with a laugh, as if at the train of thought which had led her to this conclusion.
NightAndDay	46	20355	20345	20391	Katharine	"I think you must be very clever," [MASK] observed. "Why? Because I run an office?" "I wasn t thinking of that. I was thinking how you live alone in this room, and have parties."
NightAndDay	49	20392	20368	20417	Mary	"I wasn t thinking of that. I was thinking how you live alone in this room, and have parties." [MASK] reflected for a second. "It means, chiefly, a power of being disagreeable to one s own family, I think.
NightAndDay	45	20482	20439	20484	Mary	He didn t like it.... But then I have a sister, and you haven t, have you?" "No, I haven t any sisters." "You are writing a life of your grandfather?" [MASK] pursued.
NightAndDay	41	20520	20502	20543	Mary	She replied, "Yes, I am helping my mother," in such a way that [MASK] felt herself baffled, and put back again into the position in which she had been at the beginning of their talk.
NightAndDay	48	20681	20673	20721	Katharine	"What are you laughing at?" [MASK] demanded. "I won t tell you." "Let me guess. You were laughing because you thought I d changed the conversation?" "No." "Because you think " She paused.
NightAndDay	45	20946	20915	20960	Ralph	Some one in the room behind them made a joke about star-gazing, which destroyed their pleasure in it, and they looked back into the room again. [MASK] had been watching for this moment, and he instantly produced his sentence.
NightAndDay	48	21050	21016	21064	Katharine	So, after three lessons in Latin grammar, one might correct a fellow student, whose knowledge did not embrace the ablative of "mensa." "Picture what picture?" [MASK] asked. "Oh, at home, you mean that Sunday afternoon.
NightAndDay	53	21095	21073	21126	Mary	Yes, I think I remembered it." The three of them stood for a moment awkwardly silent, and then [MASK] left them in order to see that the great pitcher of coffee was properly handled, for beneath all her education she preserved the anxieties of one who owns china.
NightAndDay	53	21212	21170	21223	Katharine	He wished her to stay there until, by some measures not yet apparent to him, he had conquered her interest. These states of mind transmit themselves very often without the use of language, and it was evident to [MASK] that this young man had fixed his mind upon her.
NightAndDay	45	21632	21620	21665	Katharine	"I don t think I understand what you mean," [MASK] repeated, and then she was obliged to stop and answer some one who wished to know whether she would buy a ticket for an opera from them, at a reduction.
NightAndDay	55	22056	22039	22094	Denham	The couple in front of them kept their distance accurately, and appeared, so far as [MASK] could judge by the way they turned towards each other, to be talking very constantly. He observed that when a pedestrian going the opposite way forced them to part they came together again directly afterwards.
NightAndDay	53	22484	22475	22528	Sandys	As they passed through the courts thus talking, [MASK] laid the tip of his stick upon one of the stones forming a time-worn arch, and struck it meditatively two or three times in order to illustrate something very obscure about the complex nature of one s apprehension of facts.
NightAndDay	50	22632	22617	22667	Katharine	But do stop a minute and look at the moon upon the water." [MASK] paused, looked up and down the river, and snuffed the air. "I m sure one can smell the sea, with the wind blowing this way," she said.
NightAndDay	56	22737	22704	22760	Rodney	Very far off up the river a steamer hooted with its hollow voice of unspeakable melancholy, as if from the heart of lonely mist-shrouded voyagings. "Ah!" [MASK] cried, striking his hand once more upon the balustrade, "why can t one say how beautiful it all is?
NightAndDay	46	22795	22778	22824	Katharine	And the things I can give there s no use in my giving. Trust me, [MASK]," he added hastily, "I won t speak of it again. But in the presence of beauty look at the iridescence round the moon!
NightAndDay	55	22878	22825	22880	Katharine	one feels one feels Perhaps if you married me I m half a poet, you see, and I can t pretend not to feel what I do feel. If I could write ah, that would be another matter. I shouldn t bother you to marry me then, [MASK]."
NightAndDay	47	22914	22881	22928	Katharine	He spoke these disconnected sentences rather abruptly, with his eyes alternately upon the moon and upon the stream. "But for me I suppose you would recommend marriage?" said [MASK], with her eyes fixed on the moon. "Certainly I should.
NightAndDay	46	23012	22968	23014	Rodney	That is why " Here he stopped himself, and they began to walk slowly along the Embankment, the moon fronting them. "With how sad steps she climbs the sky, How silently and with how wan a face," [MASK] quoted.
NightAndDay	41	23078	23078	23119	William	[MASK] drew a deep sigh. "We may lecture you till we re blue in the face " "Yes but what s he like?" "And we write sonnets to your eyebrows, you cruel practical creature.
NightAndDay	48	23333	23316	23364	Katharine	"It means, I should say, that he finds you chilly and unsympathetic." [MASK] laughed with round, separate notes of genuine amusement. "It s time I jumped into a cab and hid myself in my own house," she exclaimed.
NightAndDay	50	23388	23344	23394	Rodney	"It s time I jumped into a cab and hid myself in my own house," she exclaimed. "Would your mother object to my being seen with you? No one could possibly recognize us, could they?" [MASK] inquired, with some solicitude.
NightAndDay	52	23426	23421	23473	Katharine	"You may laugh, [MASK], but I can tell you that if any of your friends saw us together at this time of night they would talk about it, and I should find that very disagreeable. But why do you laugh?" "I don t know.
NightAndDay	54	23527	23474	23528	William	Because you re such a queer mixture, I think. You re half poet and half old maid." "I know I always seem to you highly ridiculous. But I can t help having inherited certain traditions and trying to put them into practice." "Nonsense, [MASK].
NightAndDay	44	23703	23700	23744	William	"Now, [MASK]," she said, "if people see me racing along the Embankment like this they _will_ talk. You had far better say good-night, if you don t want people to talk."
NightAndDay	45	23792	23773	23818	Katharine	"Don t let the man see us struggling, for God s sake!" he murmured. [MASK] stood for a moment quite still. "There s more of the old maid in you than the poet," she observed briefly.
NightAndDay	47	23819	23800	23847	William	"There s more of the old maid in you than the poet," she observed briefly. [MASK] shut the door sharply, gave the address to the driver, and turned away, lifting his hat punctiliously high in farewell to the invisible lady.
NightAndDay	42	24176	24150	24192	Rodney	His mind was scaling the highest pinnacles of its alps, where there was only starlight and the untrodden snow. He cast strange eyes upon [MASK], as they encountered each other beneath a lamp-post. "Ha!"
NightAndDay	58	24318	24313	24371	Denham	"You do well, [MASK]," he began impulsively, "to have nothing to do with young women. I offer you my experience if one trusts them one invariably has cause to repent. Not that I have any reason at this moment," he added hastily, "to complain of them.
NightAndDay	58	24487	24450	24508	Rodney	He could not help regretting the eagerness with which his mind returned to these interests, and fretted him with the old trivial anxieties. He sank in his own esteem. Reason bade him break from [MASK], who clearly tended to become confidential, before he had utterly lost touch with the problems of high philosophy.
NightAndDay	45	24965	24945	24990	Denham	Still, to do her justice, she s no fool," he added, as if to warn [MASK] not to take any liberties. "She has taste. She has sense. She can understand you when you talk to her.
NightAndDay	51	25016	24981	25032	Denham	She can understand you when you talk to her. But she s a woman, and there s an end of it," he added, with another little chuckle, and dropped [MASK] s arm. "And did you tell her all this to-night?"
NightAndDay	44	25077	25055	25099	Katharine	That wouldn t do at all. One has to be in an attitude of adoration in order to get on with [MASK]." "Now I ve learnt that she s refused to marry him why don t I go home?"
NightAndDay	50	25233	25194	25244	Denham	"You re a slave like me, I suppose?" he asked. "A solicitor, yes." "I sometimes wonder why we don t chuck it. Why don t you emigrate, [MASK]? I should have thought that would suit you."
NightAndDay	49	25430	25385	25434	Rodney	I ve got a few nice things up here, things I pick up cheap, for I can t afford to give what they ask." They had reached a small court of high eighteenth-century houses, in one of which [MASK] had his rooms.
NightAndDay	49	25992	25992	26041	Rodney	[MASK] turned his head half round and smiled, with the pride of a proprietor, and then prevented himself from smiling. "Tolerable," he muttered. "But I dare say it s just as well that you have to earn your own living."
NightAndDay	52	26092	26042	26094	Denham	"If you mean that I shouldn t do anything good with leisure if I had it, I dare say you re right. But I should be ten times as happy with my whole day to spend as I liked." "I doubt that," [MASK] replied.
NightAndDay	53	26127	26095	26148	Rodney	They sat silent, and the smoke from their pipes joined amicably in a blue vapor above their heads. "I could spend three hours every day reading Shakespeare," [MASK] remarked. "And there s music and pictures, let alone the society of the people one likes."
NightAndDay	42	26243	26223	26265	Denham	And it s not bad no, some of it s really rather nice." The question arose in [MASK] s mind whether he should ask to see this play, as, no doubt, he was expected to do.
NightAndDay	57	26456	26401	26458	Denham	he asked at length, in a different tone of voice from that in which he had been speaking. And, without waiting for an answer, he went on, rather querulously: "Very few people care for poetry. I dare say it bores you." "Perhaps," [MASK] remarked.
NightAndDay	47	26805	26803	26850	Rodney	It pleased [MASK] thus to give away whatever his friends genuinely admired. His library was constantly being diminished. CHAPTER VI Of all the hours of an ordinary working week-day, which are the pleasantest to look forward to and to look back upon?
NightAndDay	50	26976	26971	27021	Mary	There were few mornings when [MASK] did not look up, as she bent to lace her boots, and as she followed the yellow rod from curtain to breakfast-table she usually breathed some sigh of thankfulness that her life provided her with such moments of pure enjoyment.
NightAndDay	58	27453	27453	27511	Mary	[MASK] felt kindly disposed towards the shopkeepers, and hoped that they would trick the midday public into purchasing, for at this hour of the morning she ranged herself entirely on the side of the shopkeepers and bank clerks, and regarded all who slept late and had money to spend as her enemy and natural prey.
NightAndDay	45	29099	29085	29130	Mary	But, instead of going straight back to the office to-day, [MASK] turned into the British Museum, and strolled down the gallery with the shapes of stone until she found an empty seat directly beneath the gaze of the Elgin marbles.
NightAndDay	46	29432	29413	29459	Ralph	And she conjured up a scene of herself on a camel s back, in the desert, while [MASK] commanded a whole tribe of natives. "That is what you can do," she went on, moving on to the next statue.
NightAndDay	54	30023	30008	30062	Katharine	A voice from within shouted, "No. The S.G.S. top floor." [MASK] mounted past innumerable glass doors, with initials on them, and became steadily more and more doubtful of the wisdom of her venture. At the top she paused for a moment to breathe and collect herself.
NightAndDay	54	30101	30049	30103	Mary	At the top she paused for a moment to breathe and collect herself. She heard the typewriter and formal professional voices inside, not belonging, she thought, to any one she had ever spoken to. She touched the bell, and the door was opened almost immediately by [MASK] herself.
NightAndDay	46	30197	30154	30200	Mary	I should ring them up again double three double eight, Central. Well, this is a surprise. Come in," she added. "You re just in time for tea." The light of relief shone in [MASK] s eyes.
NightAndDay	43	30296	30257	30300	Mary	After the confusion of her twilight walk, and her random thoughts, life in this small room appeared extremely concentrated and bright. She turned instinctively to look out of the window, which was uncurtained, but [MASK] immediately recalled her.
NightAndDay	54	30386	30359	30413	Mary	Her figure in the long cloak, which took deep folds, and her face, which was composed into a mask of sensitive apprehension, disturbed [MASK] for a moment with a sense of the presence of some one who was of another world, and, therefore, subversive of her world.
NightAndDay	42	30872	30844	30886	Katharine	"We fine her a penny each time she forgets, and the fines go to buying a plum cake," she explained, seeking to draw [MASK] into the community. She had given up all hope of impressing her.
NightAndDay	41	30917	30901	30942	Katharine	"It s my misfortune to be an enthusiast," she said, turning to [MASK]. "My father s daughter could hardly be anything else. I think I ve been on as many committees as most people.
NightAndDay	44	31311	31276	31320	Katharine	"The injustice of it! Why should I have a beautiful square all to myself, when poor women who need rest have nowhere at all to sit?" She looked fiercely at [MASK], giving her short locks a little shake.
NightAndDay	44	31596	31579	31623	Mary	She had scarcely spoken, and her silence, though grave and even thoughtful, seemed to [MASK] the silence of one who criticizes. "Well, there are more in this house than I d any notion of," she said.
NightAndDay	59	31658	31604	31663	Mary	"Well, there are more in this house than I d any notion of," she said. "On the ground floor you protect natives, on the next you emigrate women and tell people to eat nuts " "Why do you say that we do these things?" [MASK] interposed, rather sharply.
NightAndDay	41	31736	31736	31777	Mary	[MASK], on the other hand, was more of his own sort, and a little too much inclined to order him about. He picked up crumbs of dry biscuit and put them into his mouth with incredible rapidity.
NightAndDay	52	32030	31980	32032	Katharine	Directly he had done speaking she burst out: "But surely, if you care about the welfare of your sex at all, you must wish them to have the vote?" "I never said I didn t wish them to have the vote," [MASK] protested.
NightAndDay	49	32264	32219	32268	Katharine	At one time I could have repeated the greater part of him by heart. But one gets out of the way of reading poetry, unfortunately. You don t remember him, I suppose?" A sharp rap at the door made [MASK] s answer inaudible.
NightAndDay	56	33050	33011	33067	Ralph	They don t see that small things matter, and that s where the leakage begins, and then we find ourselves in difficulties I very nearly lost my temper yesterday," she went on, looking at [MASK] with a little smile, as though he knew what happened when she lost her temper.
NightAndDay	41	33528	33514	33555	Katharine	It passed through his mind that if he missed this chance of talking to [MASK], he would have to face an enraged ghost, when he was alone in his room again, demanding an explanation of his cowardly indecision.
NightAndDay	47	34111	34084	34131	Ralph	She walked very fast, and the effect of people passing in the opposite direction was to produce a queer dizziness both in her head and in [MASK] s, which set their bodies far apart. But she did her duty by her companion almost unconsciously.
NightAndDay	49	34229	34212	34261	Ralph	So they walked on down the Tottenham Court Road, parting and coming together again, and [MASK] felt much as though he were addressing the summit of a poplar in a high gale of wind. "Suppose we get on to that omnibus?" he suggested.
NightAndDay	44	34626	34584	34628	Katharine	"I ve planned out my life in sections ever since I was a child, to make it last longer. You see, I m always afraid that I m missing something " "And so am I!" [MASK] exclaimed.
NightAndDay	49	34909	34888	34937	Ralph	Besides," she began impulsively, and stopped herself. Here the conductor came round, and interrupted them. [MASK] waited for her to resume her sentence, but she said no more. "I have a message to give your father," he remarked.
NightAndDay	50	35894	35854	35904	Katharine	In the first place she called them to witness that the room was darker than usual, and had all the lights turned on. "That s more cheerful," she exclaimed. "D you know, [MASK], that ridiculous goose came to tea with me?
NightAndDay	52	35953	35905	35957	Katharine	Oh, how I wanted you! He tried to make epigrams all the time, and I got so nervous, expecting them, you know, that I spilt the tea and he made an epigram about that!" "Which ridiculous goose?" [MASK] asked her father.
NightAndDay	48	36046	36003	36051	Katharine	"But we re all too hard on him. Remember how devoted he is to his tiresome old mother." "That s only because she is his mother. Any one connected with himself " "No, no, [MASK] that s too bad.
NightAndDay	48	36187	36182	36230	Katharine	"I wish," [MASK] started, with great impetuosity, and checked herself. Her mother always stirred her to feel and think quickly, and then she remembered that her father was there, listening with attention. "What is it you wish?"
NightAndDay	51	36321	36272	36323	Katharine	"I wish mother wasn t famous. I was out at tea, and they would talk to me about poetry." "Thinking you must be poetical, I see and aren t you?" "Who s been talking to you about poetry, [MASK]?"
NightAndDay	55	38082	38075	38130	Katharine	This consisted in the reading aloud by [MASK] from some prose work or other, while her mother knitted scarves intermittently on a little circular frame, and her father read the newspaper, not so attentively but that he could comment humorously now and again upon the fortunes of the hero and the heroine.
NightAndDay	54	38691	38681	38735	Katharine	Had he any cause to be ashamed of himself, [MASK] wondered; and she turned to her aunt again. "Remember," she wrote, in her profuse, emphatic statement, "that he bears your grandfather s name, and so will the child that is to be born.
NightAndDay	53	39155	39115	39168	William	However, there was no way of escaping from one s fellow-beings, she concluded, and shut the window with a sigh, and returned once more to her letters. She could not doubt but that [MASK] s letter was the most genuine she had yet received from him.
NightAndDay	48	39951	39950	39998	Katharine	When [MASK] came in he reflected that he knew what she had come for, and he made a pencil note before he spoke to her. Having done this, he saw that she was reading, and he watched her for a moment without saying anything.
NightAndDay	48	40110	40110	40158	Katharine	[MASK] found some difficulty in carrying on the conversation, while her father balanced his finger-tips so judiciously, and seemed to reserve so many of his thoughts for himself. "He s about done for himself, I should say," he continued.
NightAndDay	42	40245	40209	40251	Katharine	"Will you tell her?" "I shall tell your mother. But I shall tell her that there is nothing whatever for us to do." "But the marriage?" [MASK] asked, with some diffidence.
NightAndDay	45	40289	40263	40308	Katharine	"What in the name of conscience did he do it for?" he speculated at last, rather to himself than to her. [MASK] had begun to read her aunt s letter over again, and she now quoted a sentence. "
NightAndDay	49	40374	40329	40378	Katharine	"Well, if the younger generation want to carry on its life on those lines, it s none of our affair," he remarked. "But isn t it our affair, perhaps, to make them get married?" [MASK] asked rather wearily.
NightAndDay	45	40417	40379	40424	Alfred	"Why the dickens should they apply to me?" her father demanded with sudden irritation. "Only as the head of the family " "But I m not the head of the family. [MASK] s the head of the family.
NightAndDay	51	40726	40695	40746	Katharine	Granting the assumption that gentlemen of sixty who are highly cultivated, and have had much experience of life, probably think of many things which they do not say, [MASK] could not help feeling rather puzzled by her father s attitude, as she went back to her room.
NightAndDay	51	40780	40747	40798	Cyril	What a distance he was from it all! How superficially he smoothed these events into a semblance of decency which harmonized with his own view of life! He never wondered what [MASK] had felt, nor did the hidden aspects of the case tempt him to examine into them.
NightAndDay	47	40809	40799	40846	Cyril	He merely seemed to realize, rather languidly, that [MASK] had behaved in a way which was foolish, because other people did not behave in that way. He seemed to be looking through a telescope at little figures hundreds of miles in the distance.
NightAndDay	52	40985	40958	41010	Katharine	I m late this morning, and I ve any amount of proofs to get through." "That wouldn t do at all," [MASK] said decidedly. "She must be told you or I must tell her. We ought to have told her at first."
NightAndDay	49	41115	41099	41148	Katharine	He waved his hand once to his daughter, and was gone. Left alone, [MASK] could not help laughing to find herself cheated as usual in domestic bargainings with her father, and left to do the disagreeable work which belonged, by rights, to him.
NightAndDay	56	41245	41221	41277	Cyril	As usual, she saw something which her father and mother did not see, and the effect of that something was to suspend [MASK] s behavior in her mind without any qualification at all. They would think whether it was good or bad; to her it was merely a thing that had happened.
NightAndDay	43	41296	41295	41338	Katharine	"[MASK]," she said, lifting it in the air, "I ve just made out such a queer, strange thing about your grandfather. I m three years and six months older than he was when he died.
NightAndDay	44	41395	41385	41429	Katharine	She began her sentence, at any rate, and [MASK] sat down at her own table, untied the bundle of old letters upon which she was working, smoothed them out absent-mindedly, and began to decipher the faded script.
NightAndDay	44	41544	41528	41572	Katharine	Quiet as the room was, and undisturbed by the sounds of the present moment, [MASK] could fancy that here was a deep pool of past time, and that she and her mother were bathed in the light of sixty years ago.
NightAndDay	46	42335	42308	42354	Katharine	Perhaps it would do at the beginning of a chapter. Chapters often begin quite differently from the way they go on, you know." [MASK] read what her mother had written. She might have been a schoolmaster criticizing a child s essay.
NightAndDay	47	42525	42502	42549	Katharine	From exultation she had passed to the depths of depression which the imagination of her death aroused. The depression communicated itself to [MASK]. How impotent they were, fiddling about all day long with papers! And the clock was striking eleven and nothing done!
NightAndDay	55	42582	42550	42605	Katharine	She watched her mother, now rummaging in a great brass-bound box which stood by her table, but she did not go to her help. Of course, [MASK] reflected, her mother had now lost some paper, and they would waste the rest of the morning looking for it.
NightAndDay	51	42863	42833	42884	Katharine	Her anger immediately dissipated itself; it broke like some wave that has gathered itself high above the rest; the waters were resumed into the sea again, and [MASK] felt once more full of peace and solicitude, and anxious only that her mother should be protected from pain.
NightAndDay	44	42956	42913	42957	Katharine	"What is nobler," she mused, turning over the photographs, "than to be a woman to whom every one turns, in sorrow or difficulty? How have the young women of your generation improved upon that, [MASK]?
NightAndDay	49	43208	43183	43232	Katharine	The superb stiff folds of the crinolines suited the women; the cloaks and hats of the gentlemen seemed full of character. Once more [MASK] felt the serene air all round her, and seemed far off to hear the solemn beating of the sea upon the shore.
NightAndDay	44	43465	43462	43506	Miriam	And that s [MASK], in her coachman s cloak, with all the little capes on, and she wore great top-boots underneath. You young people may say you re unconventional, but you re nothing compared with her."
NightAndDay	56	43695	43647	43703	Katharine	She was a mere child eighteen and half dead with fright, too. But that old tyrant never repented. She used to say that she had given them three perfect months, and no one had a right to more; and I sometimes think, [MASK], that s true, you know.
NightAndDay	48	45200	45162	45210	Katharine	As she realized the facts she became thoroughly disgusted, although, perhaps, she was more hurt by the concealment of the sin than by the sin itself. She looked splendidly roused and indignant; and [MASK] felt an immense relief and pride in her mother.
NightAndDay	45	45552	45512	45557	Celia	"This unhappy business," she began, out of breath as she was. "If the train had not gone out of the station just as I arrived, I should have been with you before. [MASK] has doubtless told you.
NightAndDay	41	45802	45763	45804	Katharine	"The mischief s done, and very ugly mischief too. Are we to allow the third child to be born out of wedlock? (I am sorry to have to say these things before you, [MASK].)
NightAndDay	47	46068	46046	46093	Cromwell	One may disagree with his principle, but, at least, one can respect it like the French Revolution, or [MASK] cutting the King s head off. Some of the most terrible things in history have been done on principle," she concluded.
NightAndDay	50	46188	46182	46232	Katharine	Growing weary of it all, [MASK] turned to the window, and stood among the folds of the curtain, pressing close to the window-pane, and gazing disconsolately at the river much in the attitude of a child depressed by the meaningless talk of its elders.
NightAndDay	49	46350	46320	46369	William	No; they had their dwelling in a mist, she decided; hundreds of miles away away from what? "Perhaps it would be better if I married [MASK]," she thought suddenly, and the thought appeared to loom through the mist like solid ground.
NightAndDay	42	46604	46601	46643	Ralph	She could fancy [MASK] suddenly sacrificing his entire career for some fantastic imagination; some cause or idea or even (so her fancy ran) for some woman seen from a railway train, hanging up clothes in a back yard.
NightAndDay	51	46730	46704	46755	Ralph	On the other hand, no common love affair, had there been such a thing, would have caused her a moment s uneasiness where [MASK] was concerned. He was destined in her fancy for something splendid in the way of success or failure, she knew not which.
NightAndDay	55	47430	47402	47457	Ralph	They gave outlet to some spirit which found no work to do in real life, for, with the pessimism which his lot forced upon him, [MASK] had made up his mind that there was no use for what, contemptuously enough, he called dreams, in the world which we inhabit.
NightAndDay	49	48179	48150	48199	Ralph	In six months she knew more about his odd friends and hobbies than his own brothers and sisters knew, after living with him all his life; and [MASK] found this very pleasant, though disordering, for his own view of himself had always been profoundly serious.
NightAndDay	42	48260	48242	48284	Mary	He became less serious, and rather less dictatorial at home, for he was apt to hear [MASK] laughing at him, and telling him, as she was fond of doing, that he knew nothing at all about anything.
NightAndDay	51	48837	48798	48849	Katharine	It grew slowly fainter, but lasted until he stood outside the barrister s chambers. When his interview with the barrister was over, it was too late to go back to the office. His sight of [MASK] had put him queerly out of tune for a domestic evening.
NightAndDay	46	49341	49335	49381	Mary	But he could not talk to [MASK] about such thoughts; and he pitied her for knowing nothing of what he was feeling. "Here," he thought, "is where we differ from women; they have no sense of romance."
NightAndDay	42	49385	49360	49402	Mary	Here," he thought, "is where we differ from women; they have no sense of romance." "Well, [MASK]," he said at length, "why don t you say something amusing?"
NightAndDay	42	49416	49403	49445	Mary	His tone was certainly provoking, but, as a general rule, [MASK] was not easily provoked. This evening, however, she replied rather sharply: "Because I ve got nothing amusing to say, I suppose."
NightAndDay	49	49446	49446	49495	Ralph	[MASK] thought for a moment, and then remarked: "You work too hard. I don t mean your health," he added, as she laughed scornfully, "I mean that you seem to me to be getting wrapped up in your work."
NightAndDay	49	49550	49526	49575	Ralph	"But only a week ago you were saying the opposite." Her tone was defiant, but she became curiously depressed. [MASK] did not perceive it, and took this opportunity of lecturing her, and expressing his latest views upon the proper conduct of life.
NightAndDay	50	50003	49985	50035	Mary	What s the point of drawing-room meetings and bazaars? You want to have ideas, [MASK]; get hold of something big; never mind making mistakes, but don t niggle. Why don t you throw it all up for a year, and travel?
NightAndDay	53	50088	50042	50095	Mary	Don t be content to live with half a dozen people in a backwater all your life. But you won t," he concluded. "I ve rather come to that way of thinking myself about myself, I mean," said [MASK], surprising him by her acquiescence.
NightAndDay	43	50249	50237	50280	Mary	He fell into one of his queer silences, which seemed to [MASK], in spite of all her precautions, to have reference to what she also could not prevent herself from thinking about their feeling for each other and their relationship.
NightAndDay	55	50430	50425	50480	Mary	Like most intelligent people, [MASK] was something of an egoist, to the extent, that is, of attaching great importance to what she felt, and she was by nature enough of a moralist to like to make certain, from time to time, that her feelings were creditable to her.
NightAndDay	55	50482	50481	50536	Ralph	When [MASK] left her she thought over her state of mind, and came to the conclusion that it would be a good thing to learn a language say Italian or German. She then went to a drawer, which she had to unlock, and took from it certain deeply scored manuscript pages.
NightAndDay	47	50560	50514	50561	Ralph	She then went to a drawer, which she had to unlock, and took from it certain deeply scored manuscript pages. She read them through, looking up from her reading every now and then and thinking very intently for a few seconds about [MASK].
NightAndDay	53	50690	50665	50718	Katharine	CHAPTER XI "It s life that matters, nothing but life the process of discovering, the everlasting and perpetual process," said [MASK], as she passed under the archway, and so into the wide space of King s Bench Walk, "not the discovery itself at all.
NightAndDay	41	50860	50852	50893	Dostoevsky	This evening she had twisted the words of [MASK] to suit her mood a fatalistic mood to proclaim that the process of discovery was life, and that, presumably, the nature of one s goal mattered not at all.
NightAndDay	50	51121	51115	51165	Katharine	He made the tea, and [MASK] drew off her gloves, and crossed her legs with a gesture that was rather masculine in its ease. Nor did they talk much until they were smoking cigarettes over the fire, having placed their teacups upon the floor between them.
NightAndDay	48	51179	51142	51190	Katharine	Nor did they talk much until they were smoking cigarettes over the fire, having placed their teacups upon the floor between them. They had not met since they had exchanged letters about their relationship. [MASK] s answer to his protestation had been short and sensible.
NightAndDay	44	51608	51587	51631	William	What in the world have I done with them?" She rose and began to wander about the room. [MASK] rose also, and stood in front of the fire, muttering, "Oysters, oysters your basket of oysters!"
NightAndDay	45	51659	51632	51677	Katharine	but though he looked vaguely here and there, as if the oysters might be on the top of the bookshelf, his eyes returned always to [MASK]. She drew the curtain and looked out among the scanty leaves of the plane-trees.
NightAndDay	51	51741	51698	51749	William	Well, never mind," she concluded, turning back into the room abruptly, "I dare say some old creature is enjoying them by this time." "I should have thought that you never forgot anything," [MASK] remarked, as they settled down again.
NightAndDay	43	51773	51767	51810	William	"And I wonder," [MASK] proceeded, with some caution, "what the truth about you is? But I know this sort of thing doesn t interest you," he added hastily, with a touch of peevishness.
NightAndDay	52	52296	52250	52302	Katharine	Besides, who wants you to be learned? Leave that to the poor devils who ve got nothing better to do. You you ahem! " "Well, then, why don t you read me something before I go?" said [MASK], looking at her watch.
NightAndDay	53	52363	52312	52365	Katharine	Let me see now, what have I got to show you?" He rose, and stirred about the papers on his table, as if in doubt; he then picked up a manuscript, and after spreading it smoothly upon his knee, he looked up at [MASK] suspiciously.
NightAndDay	48	52583	52566	52614	Katharine	I begin where he soliloquizes." He jerked his head and began to read. Although [MASK] had just disclaimed any knowledge of literature, she listened attentively. At least, she listened to the first twenty-five lines attentively, and then she frowned.
NightAndDay	53	52622	52596	52649	Rodney	At least, she listened to the first twenty-five lines attentively, and then she frowned. Her attention was only aroused again when [MASK] raised his finger a sign, she knew, that the meter was about to change. His theory was that every mood has its meter.
NightAndDay	57	52848	52839	52896	William	"That seems to me extremely well written, [MASK]; although, of course, I don t know enough to criticize in detail." "But it s the skill that strikes you not the emotion?" "In a fragment like that, of course, the skill strikes one most."
NightAndDay	43	52928	52897	52940	Denham	"But perhaps have you time to listen to one more short piece? the scene between the lovers? There s some real feeling in that, I think. [MASK] agrees that it s the best thing I ve done."
NightAndDay	41	53122	53084	53125	Katharine	And I d rather yes, I really believe I d rather you thought well of my writing than any one in the world." This was so genuine a tribute to his trust in her that [MASK] was touched.
NightAndDay	50	53287	53252	53302	Rodney	While he changed in the next room, she stood by the bookcase, taking down books and opening them, but reading nothing on their pages. She felt certain that she would marry [MASK]. How could one avoid it? How could one find fault with it?
NightAndDay	56	53522	53477	53533	Denham	It was a place where feelings were liberated from the constraint which the real world puts upon them; and the process of awakenment was always marked by resignation and a kind of stoical acceptance of facts. She met no acquaintance there, as [MASK] did, miraculously transfigured; she played no heroic part.
NightAndDay	54	53653	53653	53707	William	[MASK]," she repeated firmly, "if you still want me to marry you, I will." Perhaps it was that no man could expect to have the most momentous question of his life settled in a voice so level, so toneless, so devoid of joy or energy.
NightAndDay	48	53711	53708	53756	William	At any rate [MASK] made no answer. She waited stoically. A moment later he stepped briskly from his dressing-room, and observed that if she wanted to buy more oysters he thought he knew where they could find a fishmonger s shop still open.
NightAndDay	50	53905	53866	53916	Katharine	They won t be rich, but they ll be very, very happy. I was sitting in my room late one night, feeling that nothing nice would ever happen to me again, when I heard [MASK] outside in the passage, and I thought to myself,
NightAndDay	51	54439	54389	54440	Katharine	"And though one never thinks any one good enough for the people one s fond of, he has the kindest, truest instincts, I m sure, and though he seems nervous and his manner is not commanding, I only think these things because it s [MASK].
NightAndDay	44	54461	54441	54485	Katharine	And now I ve written this, it comes over me that, of course, all the time, [MASK] has what he hasn t. She does command, she isn t nervous; it comes naturally to her to rule and control.
NightAndDay	51	54910	54900	54951	Ralph	It might have been due merely to politeness, but [MASK] felt that she received him almost with cordiality. Perhaps she was bored by drinking tea and reading a book all alone; at any rate, she tossed the book on to a sofa with a gesture of relief.
NightAndDay	52	55267	55248	55300	Katharine	All down the street and on the doorstep, and while he mounted the stairs, his dream of [MASK] possessed him; on the threshold of the room he had dismissed it, in order to prevent too painful a collision between what he dreamt of her and what she was.
NightAndDay	46	55357	55328	55374	Katharine	He glanced about him with bewilderment at finding himself among her chairs and tables; they were solid, for he grasped the back of the chair in which [MASK] had sat; and yet they were unreal; the atmosphere was that of a dream.
NightAndDay	56	55461	55437	55493	Katharine	He stood watching her come towards him, and thought her more beautiful and strange than his dream of her; for the real [MASK] could speak the words which seemed to crowd behind the forehead and in the depths of the eyes, and the commonest sentence would be flashed on by this immortal light.
NightAndDay	46	55612	55568	55614	Ralph	"I can t bear to think of it sometimes because, of course, it s none of it any good. But then one needn t read it " "You don t encourage me to write a poem," said [MASK]. "
NightAndDay	45	55683	55678	55723	Ralph	It would be easy, [MASK] thought, to worship one so far removed, and yet of so straight a nature; easy to submit recklessly to her, without thought of future pain. "Are you a poet?" she demanded.
NightAndDay	53	55826	55801	55854	Ralph	she asked, almost with impatience, tapping her spoon two or three times against the side of her cup. "Why?" [MASK] laid hands on the first words that came to mind. "Because, I suppose, it keeps an ideal alive which might die otherwise."
NightAndDay	51	56051	56006	56057	Katharine	Far off, they heard the rustle of skirts. Then the owner of the skirts appeared in the doorway, which she almost filled, nearly concealing the figure of a very much smaller lady who accompanied her. "My aunts!" [MASK] murmured, under her breath.
NightAndDay	47	56481	56481	56528	Ralph	[MASK] wondered whether she more resembled an elephant, with a jeweled head-dress, or a superb cockatoo, balanced insecurely upon its perch, and pecking capriciously at a lump of sugar. "Where are the sunsets now?" she repeated. "
NightAndDay	48	56996	56949	56997	Katharine	"Ah, no; it must have been pulled down by this time, with all the other old houses. There were such pretty lanes in those days. That was how your uncle met your Aunt Emily, you know," she addressed [MASK].
NightAndDay	42	57767	57740	57782	Shakespeare	But the romance which fell upon the figures of great writers and illumined their pages was no false radiance in her case. She carried her pocket [MASK] about with her, and met life fortified by the words of the poets.
NightAndDay	41	58167	58166	58207	Swift	"[MASK] would have agreed with you, anyhow " She looked at him, and thought that there were signs of distinct power in his brow. He would do well, she thought, to devote himself to satire.
NightAndDay	50	58458	58422	58472	Ralph	She s watching us, and summing us all up in her little mind. And they had a nurse in those days," she went on, telling her story with charming solemnity to [MASK], "who was a good woman, but engaged to a sailor.
NightAndDay	59	59013	58955	59014	Rodney	His first sensation was one of violent rage with her for having deceived him throughout the visit, fed him with pleasant old wives tales, let him see her as a child playing in a meadow, shared her youth with him, while all the time she was a stranger entirely, and engaged to marry [MASK].
NightAndDay	45	59304	59286	59331	Katharine	At the same time, he wished to say something, but he knew not what, to [MASK] alone. She took her aunts upstairs, and returned, coming towards him once more with an air of innocence and friendliness that amazed him.
NightAndDay	47	59372	59332	59379	Ralph	"My father will be back," she said. "Won t you sit down?" and she laughed, as if now they might share a perfectly friendly laugh at the tea-party. But [MASK] made no attempt to seat himself.
NightAndDay	47	59448	59448	59495	Abysses	[MASK] seemed to plunge into darkness between them. He looked at her, but her face showed that she was not thinking of him. No regret or consciousness of wrong disturbed her. "Well, I must go," he said at length.
NightAndDay	50	59817	59770	59820	Katharine	They, too, saw things very thin and shadowy, and were wafted about by the lightest breath of wind. For the substantial world, with its prospect of avenues leading on and on to the invisible distance, had slipped from him, since [MASK] was engaged.
NightAndDay	43	59840	59840	59883	Katharine	[MASK] was engaged, and she had deceived him, too. He felt for corners of his being untouched by his disaster; but there was no limit to the flood of damage; not one of his possessions was safe now.
NightAndDay	46	59989	59982	60028	Katharine	At first he made himself believe that [MASK] had treated him badly, and drew comfort from the thought that, left alone, she would recollect this, and think of him and tender him, in silence, at any rate, an apology.
NightAndDay	51	60057	60057	60108	Katharine	[MASK] had promised nothing, taken nothing; to her his dreams had meant nothing. This, indeed, was the lowest pitch of his despair. If the best of one s feelings means nothing to the person most concerned in those feelings, what reality is left us?
NightAndDay	53	60123	60085	60138	Katharine	If the best of one s feelings means nothing to the person most concerned in those feelings, what reality is left us? The old romance which had warmed his days for him, the thoughts of [MASK] which had painted every hour, were now made to appear foolish and enfeebled.
NightAndDay	52	60231	60199	60251	Denham	In what can one trust? Not in men and women. Not in one s dreams about them. There s nothing nothing, nothing left at all." Now [MASK] had reason to know that he could bring to birth and keep alive a fine anger when he chose.
NightAndDay	51	60346	60338	60389	Katharine	He had once cherished a belief, and [MASK] had embodied this belief, and she did so no longer. He did not blame her; he blamed nothing, nobody; he saw the truth. He saw the dun-colored race of waters and the blank shore.
NightAndDay	55	60527	60498	60553	Denham	But that was all there was left to him of a populous and teeming world. CHAPTER XIII The lunch hour in the office was only partly spent by [MASK] in the consumption of food. Whether fine or wet, he passed most of it pacing the gravel paths in Lincoln s Inn Fields.
NightAndDay	52	60822	60809	60861	Mary	She came back and touched him on the shoulder. "Gracious, [MASK]!" he exclaimed. "How you startled me!" "Yes. You looked as if you were walking in your sleep," she said. "Are you arranging some terrible love affair?
NightAndDay	50	60882	60838	60888	Ralph	You looked as if you were walking in your sleep," she said. "Are you arranging some terrible love affair? Have you got to reconcile a desperate couple?" "I wasn t thinking about my work," [MASK] replied, rather hastily. "
NightAndDay	51	60995	60958	61009	Ralph	However, after a turn or two, in which a few facts were communicated, he suggested sitting down, and she took the seat beside him. The sparrows came fluttering about them, and [MASK] produced from his pocket the half of a roll saved from his luncheon.
NightAndDay	51	61158	61115	61166	Mary	"Done!" he said; and his eye, which had been gloomy, showed a spark of light. His conversation was now addressed entirely to a bald cock-sparrow, who seemed bolder than the rest; and [MASK] took the opportunity of looking at him.
NightAndDay	46	61195	61182	61228	Ralph	A child came bowling its hoop through the concourse of birds, and [MASK] threw his last crumbs of bread into the bushes with a snort of impatience. "That s what always happens just as I ve almost got him," he said.
NightAndDay	42	61235	61229	61271	Mary	"Here s your sixpence, [MASK]. But you ve only got it thanks to that brute of a boy. They oughtn t to be allowed to bowl hoops here " "Oughtn t to be allowed to bowl hoops!
NightAndDay	49	61274	61272	61321	Ralph	My dear [MASK], what nonsense!" "You always say that," he complained; "and it isn t nonsense. What s the point of having a garden if one can t watch birds in it? The street does all right for hoops.
NightAndDay	46	61501	61462	61508	Ralph	"Still, I don t see why you shouldn t cherish that illusion, if it pleases you." He spoke without much vehemence of agreement or disagreement. He seemed chilled. "Wake up, [MASK]! You re half asleep!"
NightAndDay	59	61509	61509	61568	Mary	[MASK] cried, turning and pinching his sleeve. "What have you been doing with yourself? Moping? Working? Despising the world, as usual?" As he merely shook his head, and filled his pipe, she went on: "It s a bit of a pose, isn t it?"
NightAndDay	52	61584	61569	61621	Mary	"Not more than most things," he said. "Well," [MASK] remarked, "I ve a great deal to say to you, but I must go on we have a committee." She rose, but hesitated, looking down upon him rather gravely.
NightAndDay	57	61629	61608	61665	Ralph	" She rose, but hesitated, looking down upon him rather gravely. "You don t look happy, [MASK]," she said. "Is it anything, or is it nothing?" He did not immediately answer her, but rose, too, and walked with her towards the gate.
NightAndDay	55	61860	61812	61867	Mary	She made him at least dwell upon problems which were real in the sense that they were capable of solution; and the true cause of his melancholy, which was not susceptible to such treatment, sank rather more deeply into the shades of his mind. [MASK] was attentive; she was helpful.
NightAndDay	45	61868	61868	61913	Ralph	[MASK] could not help feeling grateful to her, the more so, perhaps, because he had not told her the truth about his state; and when they reached the gate again he wished to make some affectionate objection to her leaving him.
NightAndDay	49	61954	61946	61995	Mary	"It s waste of your time, [MASK]." "I agree with you that a country walk would benefit the world more," she said. "Look here," she added suddenly, "why don t you come to us at Christmas?
NightAndDay	41	62483	62472	62513	Sailor	And you guard your mistress well, don t you, [MASK]? You see that wicked men don t break into her larder when she s out at _her_ work helping poor souls who have lost their way....
NightAndDay	58	62537	62485	62543	Mary	You see that wicked men don t break into her larder when she s out at _her_ work helping poor souls who have lost their way.... But we re late we must begin!" and scattering the rest of the water indiscriminately over the floor, she hurried [MASK] into the committee-room.
NightAndDay	52	63492	63492	63544	Ralph	[MASK] had said she could not stop to consider what he had said, but he had somehow divested the proceedings of all reality. And then, without conscious effort, by some trick of the brain, she found herself becoming interested in some scheme for organizing a newspaper campaign.
NightAndDay	53	63604	63576	63629	Ralph	She committed herself to the opinion that now was the time to strike hard. Directly she had said this, she felt that she had turned upon [MASK] s ghost; and she became more and more in earnest, and anxious to bring the others round to her point of view.
NightAndDay	48	63891	63860	63908	Ralph	In one of those flights of fancy, not characteristic of her but tiresomely frequent this afternoon, she envisaged herself battered with rotten eggs upon a platform, from which [MASK] vainly begged her to descend. But "What do I matter compared with the cause?
NightAndDay	49	63988	63960	64009	Mary	" as became her father s daughter. The other members of the committee, who were all rather elderly people, were a good deal impressed by [MASK], and inclined to side with her and against each other, partly, perhaps, because of her youth.
NightAndDay	45	64018	64010	64055	Mary	The feeling that she controlled them all filled [MASK] with a sense of power; and she felt that no work can equal in importance, or be so exciting as, the work of making other people do what you want them to do.
NightAndDay	54	64287	64279	64333	Mary	In her absurd mood of lustful arrogance, [MASK] looked at the little figures and thought, "If I liked I could make you go in there or stop short; I could make you walk in single file or in double file; I could do what I liked with you."
NightAndDay	50	64580	64532	64582	Sally	On this occasion her arrogant feeling that she could direct everybody dwindled away. "Let s have our tea," she said, turning back from the window and pulling down the blind. "It was a good meeting didn t you think so, [MASK]?"
NightAndDay	50	64652	64643	64693	Sally	"You can afford to laugh," said [MASK], with another shake of her head, "but I can t. I m fifty-five, and I dare say I shall be in my grave by the time we get it if we ever do."
NightAndDay	46	64709	64666	64712	Mary	I m fifty-five, and I dare say I shall be in my grave by the time we get it if we ever do." "Oh, no, you won t be in your grave," said [MASK], kindly.
NightAndDay	53	64837	64800	64853	Mary	I wonder how it is that they don t see it?" She was carrying plates and cups from the cupboard as she spoke, so that her sentences were more than usually broken apart. [MASK] could not help looking at the odd little priestess of humanity with something like admiration.
NightAndDay	41	65024	64998	65039	Kit	It s a great mistake, to lose one s head. But my heart s in the right place. And I m so glad [MASK] has a big dog, for I didn t think her looking well."
NightAndDay	52	65132	65109	65161	Mary	Although their views were very different, this sense united them and made them almost cordial in their manners to each other. [MASK], however, left the tea-party rather early, desiring both to be alone, and then to hear some music at the Queen s Hall.
NightAndDay	49	65177	65162	65211	Ralph	She fully intended to use her loneliness to think out her position with regard to [MASK]; but although she walked back to the Strand with this end in view, she found her mind uncomfortably full of different trains of thought. She started one and then another.
NightAndDay	41	65686	65663	65704	Katharine	She had heard nothing of their engagement. But after the first disappointment, she was pleased, for she felt instantly that [MASK] was a personality, and, moreover, she need not now exercise her self-control.
NightAndDay	55	65750	65739	65794	William	"We have been to see some pictures," said [MASK]. "Oh, dear," he exclaimed, looking about him, "this room reminds me of one of the worst hours in my existence when I read a paper, and you all sat round and jeered at me.
NightAndDay	47	65795	65752	65799	Katharine	"Oh, dear," he exclaimed, looking about him, "this room reminds me of one of the worst hours in my existence when I read a paper, and you all sat round and jeered at me. [MASK] was the worst.
NightAndDay	48	65856	65851	65899	Mary	His vitality was pleasant, [MASK] thought, although he made her laugh. The very look of him was inclined to make her laugh. His rather prominent eyes passed from one young woman to the other, and his lips perpetually formed words which remained unspoken.
NightAndDay	45	66162	66118	66163	William	We did try to get some, but the shop was so crowded, and in the next one there was a band playing; and most of the pictures, at any rate, were very dull, whatever you may say, [MASK].
NightAndDay	47	66174	66164	66211	Mary	" She spoke with a kind of guarded gentleness. [MASK], accordingly, retired to make preparations in the pantry. "What in the world are they after?" she asked of her own reflection in the little looking-glass which hung there.
NightAndDay	46	66624	66603	66649	Mary	He could compare different examples in different galleries, and his authoritative answers to intelligent questions gained not a little, [MASK] felt, from the smart taps which he dealt, as he delivered them, upon the lumps of coal. She was impressed.
NightAndDay	50	66859	66859	66909	William	[MASK] answered, delighted, Mary guessed, at this little compliment. "Why, I always travel with a notebook. And I ask my way to the picture gallery the very first thing in the morning. And then I meet men, and talk to them.
NightAndDay	49	67245	67236	67285	Katharine	Otherwise she s a dull woman," said [MASK]. "At least," she added, as if to qualify her abruptness, "I find it difficult to talk to her." "Because you expect every one else to take all the trouble.
NightAndDay	46	67302	67273	67319	Mary	"Because you expect every one else to take all the trouble. I ve seen her sit silent a whole evening," he said, turning to [MASK], as he had frequently done already. "Don t you find that, too?
NightAndDay	58	67461	67449	67507	Katharine	A moment later, the door-bell rang again, and [MASK] reappeared, having left her purse on a chair. She soon found it, and said, pausing for a moment at the door, and speaking differently as they were alone: "I think being engaged is very bad for the character.
NightAndDay	51	68383	68379	68430	Horace	He had most of [MASK] by heart, and had got into the habit of connecting this particular walk with certain odes which he repeated duly, at the same time noting the condition of his flowers, and stooping now and again to pick any that were withered or overblown.
NightAndDay	55	69064	69057	69112	Elizabeth	But that s absurd," said [MASK] decidedly, when the plan was explained to her. "There are five spare rooms, even when the boys are here. Besides, he wouldn t get a room in the village. And he oughtn t to work if he s overworked."
NightAndDay	45	69285	69271	69316	Mary	Obeying an impulse which sprang from some desire to interrupt this methodical marching, [MASK] stepped on to the grass walk and put her hand on his arm. "A flower for your buttonhole, father," she said, presenting a rose.
NightAndDay	52	69393	69388	69440	Mary	He had a habit, [MASK] remarked, and she had never noticed it so clearly before, of letting his sentences tail away in a continuous murmur, whereupon he passed into a state of abstraction, presumed by his children to indicate some train of thought too profound for utterance.
NightAndDay	48	69774	69759	69807	Elizabeth	She thought it likely that her father would discuss the train service with him; [MASK] would be bright and sensible, and always leaving the room to give messages to the servants. Her brothers had already said that they would give him a day s shooting.
NightAndDay	52	69816	69808	69860	Ralph	She was content to leave the problem of [MASK] s relations to the young men obscure, trusting that they would find some common ground of masculine agreement. But what would he think of _her?_ Would he see that she was different from the rest of the family?
NightAndDay	53	70121	70069	70122	Ralph	She loved him precisely as he was; she loved them all; and as she walked by his side, up and down, and down and up, her strong moral sense administered a sound drubbing to the vain and romantic element aroused in her by the mere thought of [MASK].
NightAndDay	54	70165	70123	70177	Ralph	She felt quite certain that, for good or for bad, she was very like the rest of her family. Sitting in the corner of a third-class railway carriage, on the afternoon of the following day, [MASK] made several inquiries of a commercial traveler in the opposite corner.
NightAndDay	51	70536	70528	70579	Katharine	Since the day when he had heard from [MASK] s lips of her engagement, he had refrained from investing his dream of her with the details of real life. But the light of the late afternoon glowed green behind the straight trees, and became a symbol of her.
NightAndDay	49	70734	70692	70741	Mary	Never are voices so beautiful as on a winter s evening, when dusk almost hides the body, and they seem to issue from nothingness with a note of intimacy seldom heard by day. Such an edge was there in [MASK] s voice when she greeted him.
NightAndDay	59	70889	70849	70908	Edward	What could be the cause of her cheerfulness, he wondered, half ironically, and half enviously, as the pony-cart started briskly away, and the dusk swam between their eyes and the tall form of [MASK], standing up to drive, with the reins in one hand and the whip in the other.
NightAndDay	50	70945	70909	70959	Mary	People from the village, who had been to the market town, were climbing into their gigs, or setting off home down the road together in little parties. Many salutations were addressed to [MASK], who shouted back, with the addition of the speaker s name.
NightAndDay	50	71262	71242	71292	Ralph	Can you shoot? I shouldn t think so " "Look here, you must explain," said [MASK]. "Who are these young men? Where am I staying?" "You are staying with us, of course," she said boldly. "
NightAndDay	50	71333	71293	71343	Mary	Of course, you re staying with us you don t mind coming, do you?" "If I had, I shouldn t have come," he said sturdily. They walked on in silence; [MASK] took care not to break it for a time.
NightAndDay	50	71397	71366	71416	Mary	She was right. In a moment he expressed his pleasure, much to her comfort. "This is the sort of country I thought you d live in, [MASK]," he said, pushing his hat back on his head, and looking about him. "
NightAndDay	48	71463	71416	71464	Mary	"Real country. No gentlemen s seats." He snuffed the air, and felt more keenly than he had done for many weeks the pleasure of owning a body. "Now we have to find our way through a hedge," said [MASK].
NightAndDay	51	71595	71577	71628	Ralph	"I could live on fifteen shillings a week easily." "Could you?" said [MASK]. "I don t believe you could," he added. "Oh yes. They have a cottage thrown in, and a garden where one can grow vegetables.
NightAndDay	50	71703	71662	71712	Ralph	"I sometimes think it s the only thing one would never get tired of," she replied. The idea of a cottage where one grew one s own vegetables and lived on fifteen shillings a week, filled [MASK] with an extraordinary sense of rest and satisfaction.
NightAndDay	46	71809	71766	71812	Ralph	"And what about the Suffrage?" he asked, attempting sarcasm. "Oh, there are other things in the world besides the Suffrage," she replied, in an off-hand manner which was slightly mysterious. [MASK] fell silent.
NightAndDay	51	71918	71876	71927	Mary	He struck his stick upon the earth, and stared through the dusk at the shape of the country. "D you know the points of the compass?" he asked. "Well, of course," said [MASK]. "What d you take me for?
NightAndDay	48	71988	71949	71997	Ralph	"It s my native land, this," she said. "I could smell my way about it blindfold." As if to prove this boast, she walked a little quicker, so that [MASK] found it difficult to keep pace with her.
NightAndDay	58	72304	72291	72349	Mary	A country life and breeding had preserved in them all a look which [MASK] hesitated to call either innocent or youthful, as she compared them, now sitting round in an oval, softly illuminated by candlelight; and yet it was something of the kind, yes, even in the case of the Rector himself.
NightAndDay	51	72400	72350	72401	Ralph	Though superficially marked with lines, his face was a clear pink, and his blue eyes had the long-sighted, peaceful expression of eyes seeking the turn of the road, or a distant light through rain, or the darkness of winter. She looked at [MASK].
NightAndDay	51	72662	72622	72673	Denham	Indeed, the chief burden of the talk fell upon him, and he sustained it to-night in a manner which caused his sons to look at him admiringly now and then; for they felt shy of [MASK], and were glad not to have to talk themselves.
NightAndDay	42	72822	72799	72841	Elizabeth	"It s got the old rests by the side of the fireplace, where the men hung their guns," said [MASK], leading the way, with a tall brass candlestick in her hand, down a passage. "
NightAndDay	53	73150	73115	73168	Christopher	In a few minutes a smile came to her face, and remained there for the rest of the evening. "Will you come out shooting with us to-morrow?" said [MASK], who had, on the whole, formed a favorable impression of his sister s friend.
NightAndDay	43	73460	73451	73494	Ralph	She was pleased to see that her brothers liked [MASK], to the extent, that is, of wishing to secure his good opinion. Whether or not he liked them it was impossible to tell from his kind but experienced manner.
NightAndDay	49	73617	73604	73653	Christopher	"All the same, I shall have to get up," [MASK] grumbled. He let in the dog, and stood for a moment by the door, which opened into the garden, to revive himself with a draught of the black, starlit air.
NightAndDay	52	73664	73620	73672	Mary	He let in the dog, and stood for a moment by the door, which opened into the garden, to revive himself with a draught of the black, starlit air. "Do come in and shut the door!" [MASK] cried, half turning in her chair.
NightAndDay	45	73890	73890	73935	Mary	[MASK] had ceased to stroke her brother s head; he moved it impatiently between her knees, and, much as though he were a child, she began once more to part the thick, reddish-colored locks this way and that.
NightAndDay	48	73959	73936	73984	Ralph	But a far stronger passion had taken possession of her soul than any her brother could inspire in her, and, seeing [MASK] s change of expression, her hand almost automatically continued its movements, while her mind plunged desperately for some hold upon slippery banks.
NightAndDay	49	74772	74747	74796	Henry	I want to have a house of my own. It isn t possible at home. It s all very well for you, [MASK]; you can go your own way. I have to be there always. Besides, you know what our house is.
NightAndDay	58	74875	74868	74926	Katharine	Even in this purely imaginary dialogue, [MASK] found it difficult to confide her ambition to an imaginary companion. "I should like," she began, and hesitated quite a long time before she forced herself to add, with a change of voice, "to study mathematics to know about the stars."
NightAndDay	50	74962	74962	75012	Katharine	[MASK] thereupon went on with the statement of her case. "I don t care much whether I ever get to know anything but I want to work out something in figures something that hasn t got to do with human beings. I don t want people particularly.
NightAndDay	49	75017	74986	75035	Henry	but I want to work out something in figures something that hasn t got to do with human beings. I don t want people particularly. In some ways, [MASK], I m a humbug I mean, I m not what you all take me for.
NightAndDay	46	75090	75049	75095	William	And if I could calculate things, and use a telescope, and have to work out figures, and know to a fraction where I was wrong, I should be perfectly happy, and I believe I should give [MASK] all he wants."
NightAndDay	48	75169	75163	75211	William	Would she, indeed, give [MASK] all he wanted? In order to decide the question, she ran her mind rapidly over her little collection of significant sayings, looks, compliments, gestures, which had marked their intercourse during the last day or two.
NightAndDay	51	75855	75841	75892	Katharine	A semicircular flight of shallow steps led to a very large door, which [MASK] had left ajar. She hesitated, cast her eyes over the front of the house, marked that a light burnt in one small window upon an upper floor, and pushed the door open.
NightAndDay	50	76206	76188	76238	Katharine	"You have fled, too, then?" he said, looking at her cloak. [MASK] had forgotten to remove this token of her star-gazing. "Fled?" she asked. "From whom d you mean? Oh, the family party.
NightAndDay	53	76264	76233	76286	Henry	Oh, the family party. Yes, it was hot down there, so I went into the garden." "And aren t you very cold?" [MASK] inquired, placing coal on the fire, drawing a chair up to the grate, and laying aside her cloak.
NightAndDay	52	76398	76393	76445	Katharine	"How I wish " [MASK] began, and stopped short. "I think these parties are a great mistake," she added briefly, and sighed. "Oh, horrible!" he agreed; and they both fell silent. Her sigh made him look at her.
NightAndDay	55	76865	76812	76867	Henry	Indeed, she sat quite silent for over a minute. "When you consider things like the stars, our affairs don t seem to matter very much, do they?" she said suddenly. "I don t think I ever do consider things like the stars," [MASK] replied.
NightAndDay	51	76963	76916	76967	Henry	No explanation of anything?" he inquired, with a smile. "Oh, things happen. That s about all," she let drop in her casual, decided way. "That certainly seems to explain some of your actions," [MASK] thought to himself.
NightAndDay	58	77225	77178	77236	William	"Oh, they may want to settle something," she replied vaguely, putting her feet on the ground, resting her chin on her hands, and looking out of her large dark eyes contemplatively at the fire. "And then there s [MASK]," she added, as if by an afterthought.
NightAndDay	46	77256	77246	77292	Henry	"Do they know what coals are made of, [MASK]?" she asked, a moment later. "Mares tails, I believe," he hazarded. "Have you ever been down a coal-mine?" she went on.
NightAndDay	50	77304	77259	77309	Katharine	she asked, a moment later. "Mares tails, I believe," he hazarded. "Have you ever been down a coal-mine?" she went on. "Don t let s talk about coal-mines, [MASK]," he protested.
NightAndDay	52	77358	77358	77410	Henry	[MASK] could not pretend that he was altogether ignorant of her meaning, though, certainly, he had never guessed that she minded the teasing. But before he knew what to say, her eyes were clear again, and the sudden crack in the surface was almost filled up.
NightAndDay	47	77430	77385	77432	Henry	But before he knew what to say, her eyes were clear again, and the sudden crack in the surface was almost filled up. "Things aren t easy, anyhow," she stated. Obeying an impulse of genuine affection, [MASK] spoke.
NightAndDay	42	77437	77433	77475	Katharine	"Promise me, [MASK], that if I can ever help you, you will let me." She seemed to consider, looking once more into the red of the fire, and decided to refrain from any explanation.
NightAndDay	42	77490	77476	77518	Henry	"Yes, I promise that," she said at length, and [MASK] felt himself gratified by her complete sincerity, and began to tell her now about the coal-mine, in obedience to her love of facts.
NightAndDay	56	77573	77519	77575	Rodney	They were, indeed, descending the shaft in a small cage, and could hear the picks of the miners, something like the gnawing of rats, in the earth beneath them, when the door was burst open, without any knocking. "Well, here you are!" [MASK] exclaimed.
NightAndDay	41	77620	77594	77635	Katharine	It was clear that his temper was ruffled. "That s where you ve been all the time," he repeated, looking at [MASK]. "I ve only been here about ten minutes," she replied.
NightAndDay	42	77639	77622	77664	Katharine	"I ve only been here about ten minutes," she replied. "My dear [MASK], you left the drawing-room over an hour ago." She said nothing. "Does it very much matter?"
NightAndDay	42	77728	77688	77730	Henry	"They don t like it," he said. "It isn t kind to old people to leave them alone although I ve no doubt it s much more amusing to sit up here and talk to [MASK]."
NightAndDay	42	78252	78222	78264	Katharine	" This he decorated with those flourishes and decorative borders which grow of themselves upon these occasions; and as he did so, he thought to himself that whatever [MASK] s difficulties might be, they did not justify her behavior.
NightAndDay	41	78301	78265	78306	Rodney	She had spoken with a kind of brutality which suggested that, whether it is natural or assumed, women have a peculiar blindness to the feelings of men. The penciling of this note gave [MASK] time to recover himself.
NightAndDay	44	78366	78365	78409	Rodney	But [MASK] enjoyed the courage which springs from that laughable and lovable defect, and when he had mastered his first impulse, in some way to make a fool of himself, he drew inspiration from the perfect fit of his evening dress.
NightAndDay	51	78451	78410	78461	Otway	He chose a cigarette, tapped it on the back of his hand, displayed his exquisite pumps on the edge of the fender, and summoned his self-respect. "You ve several big estates round here, [MASK]," he began. "Any good hunting?
NightAndDay	42	78553	78519	78561	Rodney	I don t hunt myself. You re a great huntsman, aren t you? You have a great reputation as a horseman, anyhow," he added, desiring to help [MASK] in his effort to recover his complacency.
NightAndDay	48	78570	78562	78610	Rodney	"Oh, I love riding," [MASK] replied. "Could I get a horse down here? Stupid of me! I forgot to bring any clothes. I can t imagine, though, who told you I was anything of a rider?"
NightAndDay	42	78707	78697	78739	Rodney	"I don t care much for shooting," [MASK] continued; "but one has to do it, unless one wants to be altogether out of things. I dare say there s some very pretty country round here.
NightAndDay	53	78791	78790	78843	Rodney	But [MASK], now started on an agreeable current of reflection, could not resist the temptation of pursuing it a little further. He appeared to himself as a man who moved easily in very good society, and knew enough about the true values of life to be himself above it.
NightAndDay	51	78888	78844	78895	Henry	"Oh, but you should," he went on. "It s well worth staying there, anyhow, once a year. They make one very comfortable, and the women are ravishing." "The women?" [MASK] thought to himself, with disgust.
NightAndDay	50	78919	78896	78946	Rodney	"What could any woman see in you?" His tolerance was rapidly becoming exhausted, but he could not help liking [MASK] nevertheless, and this appeared to him strange, for he was fastidious, and such words in another mouth would have condemned the speaker irreparably.
NightAndDay	58	79033	79024	79082	Rodney	"I don t find any difficulty," [MASK] chuckled. "You talk to them about their children, if they have any, or their accomplishments painting, gardening, poetry they re so delightfully sympathetic. Seriously, you know I think a woman s opinion of one s poetry is always worth having.
NightAndDay	54	79141	79137	79191	Rodney	"Quite," [MASK] agreed. "She is " He seemed about to describe her, and he hesitated for a long time. "She s looking very well," he stated, or rather almost inquired, in a different tone from that in which he had been speaking.
NightAndDay	52	79192	79144	79196	Henry	"She is " He seemed about to describe her, and he hesitated for a long time. "She s looking very well," he stated, or rather almost inquired, in a different tone from that in which he had been speaking. [MASK] bent his head.
NightAndDay	48	79472	79449	79497	Henry	She admires my poetry, you know, but that wouldn t be enough for her?" "No," said [MASK]. He paused. "I think you re right," he added, as if he were summing up his thoughts. "
NightAndDay	46	79498	79474	79520	Katharine	He paused. "I think you re right," he added, as if he were summing up his thoughts. "[MASK] hasn t found herself yet. Life isn t altogether real to her yet I sometimes think " "Yes?"
NightAndDay	51	79900	79896	79947	Eleanor	He made his daughter [MASK] into his chief confidante, and the prime of her life was being rapidly consumed by her father. To her he dictated the memoirs which were to avenge his memory, and she had to assure him constantly that his treatment had been a disgrace.
NightAndDay	43	80569	80563	80606	Katharine	In this protest of his, [MASK] had always given him her support, and as she was generally held to be an extremely sensible person, who dressed too well to be eccentric, he had found her support of some use.
NightAndDay	59	80734	80716	80775	Cassandra	That poor lady, for instance, consulted her for advice when, one day, she opened [MASK] s bedroom door on a mission of discovery, and found the ceiling hung with mulberry-leaves, the windows blocked with cages, and the tables stacked with home-made machines for the manufacture of silk dresses.
NightAndDay	44	81372	81335	81379	Katharine	"I never _shall_ know my way about this house!" she exclaimed. "I m on my way to the library, and I don t want to interrupt. You and [MASK] were having a little chat?"
NightAndDay	47	81779	81746	81793	Katharine	I used to dream of white horses and palanquins, too; but still, I like the ink-pots best. And who knows?" she concluded, looking at [MASK], "your father may be made a baronet to-morrow."
NightAndDay	41	81860	81843	81884	Katharine	"But if you can give way to your husband," she said, speaking to [MASK], as if there were a separate understanding between them, "a happy marriage is the happiest thing in the world."
NightAndDay	53	81890	81885	81938	Katharine	"Yes," said [MASK], "but " She did not mean to finish her sentence, she merely wished to induce her mother and her aunt to go on talking about marriage, for she was in the mood to feel that other people could help her if they would.
NightAndDay	49	82027	82025	82074	Katharine	Normally, [MASK] would have hurried her mother downstairs, and seen that no excuse for distraction came her way. Her attitude towards the poet s life, however, had changed with other changes; and she was content to forget all about her scheme of hours.
NightAndDay	50	82262	82235	82285	Katharine	"I should say a quick, impatient temper. Most, in fact _all_ great men have had bad tempers except your grandfather, [MASK]," and here she sighed, and suggested that, perhaps, she ought to go down to the library. "
NightAndDay	50	82305	82286	82336	Katharine	But in the ordinary marriage, is it necessary to give way to one s husband?" said [MASK], taking no notice of her mother s suggestion, blind even to the depression which had now taken possession of her at the thought of her own inevitable death.
NightAndDay	43	82692	82679	82722	Katharine	But when her mother said that marriage was the most interesting life, [MASK] felt, as she was apt to do suddenly, for no definite reason, that they understood each other, in spite of differing in every possible way.
NightAndDay	46	82755	82723	82769	Katharine	Yet the wisdom of the old seems to apply more to feelings which we have in common with the rest of the human race than to our feelings as individuals, and [MASK] knew that only some one of her own age could follow her meaning.
NightAndDay	49	83022	83013	83062	Charlotte	Isn t there some little cottage near you, [MASK], which would do for us, with a spare room, perhaps, in case we asked a friend down? And we should save so much money that we should be able to travel " "Yes.
NightAndDay	44	83133	83123	83167	Katharine	"And I was just going to tell you, [MASK], how, when I woke this morning, everything seemed so clear in my head that if I d had a pencil I believe I could have written quite a long chapter.
NightAndDay	45	83216	83182	83227	Katharine	A few trees round it, and a little garden, a pond with a Chinese duck, a study for your father, a study for me, and a sitting room for [MASK], because then she ll be a married lady."
NightAndDay	41	83421	83399	83440	William	And while she turned it round her lips set themselves firmly together, and it seemed to her that she could satisfy [MASK] as these women had satisfied their husbands; she could pretend to like emeralds when she preferred diamonds.
NightAndDay	57	83501	83468	83525	Katharine	Indeed, one ought to be thankful to see the sun at all, and she advised them both to dress warmly for their drive. Her aunt s stock of commonplaces, [MASK] sometimes suspected, had been laid in on purpose to fill silences with, and had little to do with her private thoughts.
NightAndDay	45	84787	84769	84814	Mary	The bodily exercise made them both feel more direct and less self-conscious than usual, and [MASK], indeed, was overcome by a sort of light-headedness which made it seem to her that it mattered very little what happened next.
NightAndDay	49	84832	84815	84864	Ralph	It mattered so little, indeed, that she felt herself on the point of saying to [MASK]: "I love you; I shall never love anybody else. Marry me or leave me; think what you like of me I don t care a straw.
NightAndDay	51	85276	85261	85312	Mary	I suppose this all seems to you mad, though?" By this time [MASK] had recovered her self-control. "No. I thought you weren t happy," she said. "Why did you think that?" he asked, with some surprise.
NightAndDay	52	85380	85375	85427	Mary	"You re right, [MASK]," he said, with something of an effort, "though I don t know how you guessed it." She was silent, hoping that he might tell her the reason of his unhappiness, for his excuses had not deceived her.
NightAndDay	47	85670	85638	85685	Katharine	This rather stilted beginning did not please him, and it became more and more obvious to him that, whatever he might say, his unhappiness had been directly caused by [MASK]. "I began to find my life unsatisfactory," he started afresh.
NightAndDay	47	85947	85902	85949	Mary	Like most people, I suppose, I ve lived almost entirely among delusions, and now I m at the awkward stage of finding it out. I want another delusion to go on with. That s what my unhappiness amounts to, [MASK]."
NightAndDay	51	85977	85972	86023	Ralph	In the first place, [MASK] made no mention of marriage; in the second, he was not speaking the truth. "I don t think it will be difficult to find a cottage," she said, with cheerful hardness, ignoring the whole of this statement.
NightAndDay	50	86066	86036	86086	Ralph	Yes," she concluded, "I don t see why it shouldn t be a very good plan." They crossed the field in complete silence. [MASK] was surprised by her remark and a little hurt, and yet, on the whole, rather pleased.
NightAndDay	47	86187	86158	86205	Ralph	He was not displeased to find that those limits were very clearly marked. When they had crossed the next hedge she said to him: "Yes, [MASK], it s time you made a break. I ve come to the same conclusion myself.
NightAndDay	53	86285	86237	86290	Ralph	They ll teach me something about organizing a movement there, and I ll come back and show you how to do it." If she meant consciously or unconsciously to belittle the seclusion and security of a country cottage, she did not succeed; for [MASK] s determination was genuine.
NightAndDay	51	86341	86291	86342	Katharine	But she made him visualize her in her own character, so that he looked quickly at her, as she walked a little in front of him across the plowed field; for the first time that morning he saw her independently of him or of his preoccupation with [MASK].
NightAndDay	51	86392	86378	86429	Ralph	he exclaimed, and stopped. "That s what you said before, [MASK]," she returned, without looking at him. "You want to go away yourself and you don t want me to go away. That s not very sensible, is it?"
NightAndDay	57	86431	86403	86460	Mary	"You want to go away yourself and you don t want me to go away. That s not very sensible, is it?" "[MASK]," he cried, stung by the remembrance of his exacting and dictatorial ways with her, "what a brute I ve been to you!"
NightAndDay	51	86992	86948	86999	Mary	The chirp of a robin on the bough above his head awakened him, and his awakenment was accompanied by a sigh. Here was the world in which he had lived; here the plowed field, the high road yonder, and [MASK], stripping ivy from the trees.
NightAndDay	52	87422	87398	87450	Ralph	And what s your book to be about?" she said, as boldly as if she had never come to grief with [MASK] in talking about books. He told her unhesitatingly that he meant to write the history of the English village from Saxon days to the present time.
NightAndDay	43	87690	87667	87710	Ralph	She wound her ivy spray round her ash-plant, and for the first time for many days, when alone with [MASK], set no spies upon her motives, sayings, and feelings, but surrendered herself to complete happiness.
NightAndDay	41	88579	88540	88581	Mary	The idea was so spontaneous that it seemed to shape itself of its own accord before his eyes. It was then that he turned round and made use of his old, instinctive phrase: "Well, [MASK] ?"
NightAndDay	52	88612	88582	88634	Mary	As it presented itself to him at first, the idea was so new and interesting that he was half inclined to address it, without more ado, to [MASK] herself. His natural instinct to divide his thoughts carefully into two different classes before he expressed them to her prevailed.
NightAndDay	41	88846	88830	88871	Mary	Haven t we nearly done? Why don t they take away these plates?" [MASK] felt his agitation without looking at him; she felt convinced that she knew what it was that he wished to say to her.
NightAndDay	52	88918	88911	88963	Ralph	"I want to apologize," [MASK] continued, not quite knowing what he was about to say, but feeling some curious instinct which urged him to commit himself irrevocably, and to prevent the moment of intimacy from passing. "I think I ve treated you very badly.
NightAndDay	43	89370	89359	89402	Ralph	"I ve told you I m a liar," [MASK] repeated obstinately. "Oh, in little things, I dare say," she said impatiently. "But not in real ones, and that s what matters.
NightAndDay	52	89707	89698	89750	Mary	At one moment he exulted in the thought that [MASK] loved him; at the next, it seemed that he was without feeling for her; her love was repulsive to him. Now he felt urged to marry her at once; now to disappear and never see her again.
NightAndDay	52	89940	89906	89958	Ralph	She seemed to be looking for somebody. Her eyes, in fact, scanned both sides of the street, and for one second were raised directly to the bow window in which [MASK] stood; but she looked away again instantly without giving any sign that she had seen him.
NightAndDay	55	90158	90137	90192	Ralph	She knew it all now. After a moment of downcast stupor, she raised her eyes, looked steadily at [MASK], and caught his fixed and dreamy gaze leveled at a point far beyond their surroundings, a point that she had never reached in all the time that she had known him.
NightAndDay	50	90943	90916	90966	Providence	Only yesterday my husband was telling me he thought you one of the cleverest young men he knew. Certainly, you ve been the messenger of [MASK] to me, for unless I d seen you I m sure I should never have found the ruins at all."
NightAndDay	52	91076	91076	91128	Katharine	[MASK], who had gone a few steps by herself down the road, and was investigating the window of an ironmonger, as if her mother might have got herself concealed among mowing-machines and garden-shears, turned sharply on hearing her voice, and came towards them.
NightAndDay	51	91824	91808	91859	Mary	I m going to live here as soon as I can find a cottage, and [MASK] tells me there ll be no difficulty about that." "But," she exclaimed, almost standing still in her surprise, "you will give up the Bar, then?
NightAndDay	53	91873	91836	91889	Mary	"But," she exclaimed, almost standing still in her surprise, "you will give up the Bar, then?" It flashed across her mind that he must already be engaged to [MASK]. "The solicitor s office? Yes. I m giving that up."
NightAndDay	46	92621	92608	92654	Rodney	The carriage grew smaller and smaller upon the dusky road, and still [MASK] did not speak. Perhaps, she thought, he waited until the last sign of the carriage had disappeared beneath the curve of the road and they were left entirely alone.
NightAndDay	57	92747	92739	92796	Katharine	In company it was far easier to approach [MASK]; alone with her, the aloofness and force of her character checked all his natural methods of attack. He believed that she had behaved very badly to him, but each separate instance of unkindness seemed too petty to be advanced when they were alone together.
NightAndDay	49	93077	93031	93080	Henry	I was waiting for you ten minutes, and you never came. Every one saw me waiting. The stable-boys saw me. I was so ashamed that I went in. Then, on the drive you hardly spoke to me. [MASK] noticed it.
NightAndDay	50	93093	93081	93131	Henry	Every one notices it.... You find no difficulty in talking to [MASK], though." She noted these various complaints and determined philosophically to answer none of them, although the last stung her to considerable irritation. She wished to find out how deep his grievance lay.
NightAndDay	46	93218	93210	93256	Katharine	"And we might be so happy, [MASK]!" he exclaimed impulsively, and drew her arm through his. She withdrew it directly. "As long as you let yourself feel like this we shall never be happy," she said.
NightAndDay	50	93261	93221	93271	Henry	he exclaimed impulsively, and drew her arm through his. She withdrew it directly. "As long as you let yourself feel like this we shall never be happy," she said. The harshness, which [MASK] had noticed, was again unmistakable in her manner.
NightAndDay	52	93408	93357	93409	Katharine	By a considerable effort of self-control he forced himself to remain silent, and to make himself distinguish what part of his pain was due to vanity, what part to the certainty that no woman really loving him could speak thus. "What do I feel about [MASK]?
NightAndDay	48	93628	93599	93647	Katharine	The truth of it is," he thought, "that I ve got such despicable faults that no one could help speaking to me like that. [MASK] is quite right. And yet those are not my serious feelings, as she knows quite well.
NightAndDay	45	93754	93732	93777	Katharine	But the feeling that underlay all these feelings and puzzled him profoundly and kept him silent was the certainty that he loved [MASK] as sincerely as he had it in him to love any one. And yet she could speak to him like that!
NightAndDay	48	93803	93768	93816	Katharine	And yet she could speak to him like that! In a sort of bewilderment he lost all desire to speak, and would quite readily have taken up some different topic of conversation if [MASK] had started one. This, however, she did not do.
NightAndDay	51	93951	93925	93976	William	"If you have no feeling for me, wouldn t it be kinder to say so to me in private?" "Oh, [MASK]," she burst out, as if he had interrupted some absorbing train of thought, "how you go on about feelings!
NightAndDay	49	94085	94037	94086	Katharine	I m vain, I ve a thousand faults; but you know they re not everything; you know I care for you." "And if I say that I care for you, don t you believe me?" "Say it, [MASK]!
NightAndDay	54	94539	94490	94544	Henry	"No, never," she repeated obstinately. "Not rightly. Don t you see, I didn t know what I was doing?" "You love some one else?" he cut her short. "Absolutely no one." "[MASK]?" he demanded.
NightAndDay	52	94589	94568	94620	Katharine	"There has been a change in the last few weeks. You owe it to me to be honest, [MASK]." "If I could, I would," she replied. "Why did you tell me you would marry me, then?" he demanded.
NightAndDay	50	94765	94727	94777	Rodney	"You couldn t have accepted me if you hadn t loved me!" he cried. A sense of her own misbehavior, which she had succeeded in keeping from her by sharpening her consciousness of [MASK] s faults, now swept over her and almost overwhelmed her.
NightAndDay	48	95313	95304	95352	Katharine	"When did you begin to feel this, [MASK]?" he said; "for it isn t true to say that you ve always felt it. I admit I was unreasonable the first night when you found that your clothes had been left behind.
NightAndDay	51	95385	95353	95404	Henry	Still, where s the fault in that? I could promise you never to interfere with your clothes again. I admit I was cross when I found you upstairs with [MASK]. Perhaps I showed it too openly. But that s not unreasonable either when one s engaged.
NightAndDay	47	95452	95428	95475	Henry	"This decision you say you ve come to have you discussed it with any one? Your mother, for example, or [MASK]?" "No, no, of course not," she said, stirring the leaves with her hand. "
NightAndDay	41	95483	95475	95516	William	"But you don t understand me, [MASK] " "Help me to understand you " "You don t understand, I mean, my real feelings; how could you? I ve only now faced them myself.
NightAndDay	53	95627	95584	95637	Katharine	"I should have done it before," she said gloomily. "You make yourself think things you don t think," he continued, becoming demonstrative with his hands, as his manner was. "Believe me, [MASK], before we came here we were perfectly happy.
NightAndDay	48	95695	95656	95704	Katharine	like any other woman who is about to be married. Now, for no reason whatever, you begin to fret about your feeling and about my feeling, with the usual result. I assure you, [MASK], I ve been through it all myself.
NightAndDay	53	96046	96008	96061	William	The thought was not a pleasant one for a proud woman, but she had yet to learn the art of subduing her expression. Her eyes fixed upon the ground, her brows drawn together, gave [MASK] a very fair picture of the resentment that she was forcing herself to control.
NightAndDay	53	96328	96305	96358	Katharine	He brushed off his face any trace that might remain of that unseemly exhibition of emotion. But he was more troubled by [MASK] s appearance, as she sat rapt in thought upon the ground, than by his own; there was something improper to him in her self-forgetfulness.
NightAndDay	53	96604	96562	96615	William	She smiled a little at the minute care with which he tidied her and yet, when he brushed the dead leaves from his own coat, she flinched, seeing in that action the gesture of a lonely man. "[MASK]," she said, "I will marry you.
NightAndDay	56	96775	96744	96800	Mary	He was determined that the glow, the romance, the atmosphere of this meeting should not paint what he must in future regard as sober facts. On her side [MASK] was silent, not because her thoughts took much handling, but because her mind seemed empty of thought as her heart of feeling.
NightAndDay	55	97025	97021	97076	Mary	The point is, [MASK], that I want to marry you. Well, what do you say?" He spoke firmly, waited for no answer, and took her arm in his. "You know me by this time, the good and the bad," he went on.
NightAndDay	47	97100	97093	97140	Mary	Well, what do you say, [MASK]?" She said nothing, but this did not seem to strike him. "In most ways, at least in the important ways, as you said, we know each other and we think alike.
NightAndDay	52	97173	97157	97209	Mary	And if you feel the same about me as you do, don t you, [MASK]? we should make each other happy." Here he paused, and seemed to be in no hurry for an answer; he seemed, indeed, to be continuing his own thoughts.
NightAndDay	53	97224	97175	97228	Mary	we should make each other happy." Here he paused, and seemed to be in no hurry for an answer; he seemed, indeed, to be continuing his own thoughts. "Yes, but I m afraid I couldn t do it," [MASK] said at last.
NightAndDay	54	97319	97289	97343	Mary	"No, I couldn t marry you," she replied. "You don t care for me?" She made no answer. "Well, [MASK]," he said, with a curious laugh, "I must be an arrant fool, for I thought you did.
NightAndDay	42	97376	97344	97386	Mary	" They walked for a minute or two in silence, and suddenly he turned to her, looked at her, and exclaimed: "I don t believe you, [MASK]. You re not telling me the truth."
NightAndDay	54	97395	97378	97432	Ralph	You re not telling me the truth." "I m too tired to argue, [MASK]," she replied, turning her head away from him. "I ask you to believe what I say. I can t marry you; I don t want to marry you."
NightAndDay	53	97453	97408	97461	Ralph	"I ask you to believe what I say. I can t marry you; I don t want to marry you." The voice in which she stated this was so evidently the voice of one in some extremity of anguish that [MASK] had no course but to obey her.
NightAndDay	49	97585	97577	97626	Katharine	No good had ever come to him from [MASK]; his whole relationship with her had been made up of dreams; and as he thought of the little substance there had been in his dreams he began to lay the blame of the present catastrophe upon his dreams.
NightAndDay	51	97646	97642	97693	Mary	I might have loved [MASK] if it hadn t been for that idiocy of mine. She cared for me once, I m certain of that, but I tormented her so with my humors that I let my chances slip, and now she won t risk marrying me.
NightAndDay	59	97883	97867	97926	Ralph	She tried to recapture a saying she had made to help herself that morning, as [MASK] paid the bill for luncheon; but she could see him paying the bill more vividly than she could remember the phrase. Something about truth was in it; how to see the truth is our great chance in this world.
NightAndDay	57	97938	97927	97984	Ralph	"If you don t want to marry me," [MASK] now began again, without abruptness, with diffidence rather, "there is no need why we should cease to see each other, is there? Or would you rather that we should keep apart for the present?" "Keep apart?
NightAndDay	55	98002	97967	98022	Mary	Or would you rather that we should keep apart for the present?" "Keep apart? I don t know I must think about it." "Tell me one thing, [MASK]," he resumed; "have I done anything to make you change your mind about me?"
NightAndDay	58	98293	98286	98344	Mary	But must they kill our friendship, [MASK]? Let me keep that, at least." "Oh," she thought to herself, with a sudden rush of anguish which threatened disaster to her self-respect, "it has come to this to this when I could have given him everything!"
NightAndDay	54	98461	98444	98498	Elizabeth	One more reference was made to the state of things between them late that night, when [MASK] had gone to her room, and the two young men had stumbled off to bed in such a state of sleep that they hardly felt the floor beneath their feet after a day s shooting.
NightAndDay	52	98657	98610	98662	Ralph	But she had determined that there was no reason why he should suffer if her reticence were the cause of his suffering. Therefore, although she found it painful, she spoke: "You asked me if I had changed my mind about you, [MASK]," she said.
NightAndDay	47	98706	98672	98719	Ralph	When you asked me to marry you, I don t think you meant it. That made me angry for the moment. Before, you d always spoken the truth." [MASK] s book slid down upon his knee and fell upon the floor.
NightAndDay	44	98749	98720	98764	Mary	He rested his forehead on his hand and looked into the fire. He was trying to recall the exact words in which he had made his proposal to [MASK]. "I never said I loved you," he said at last.
NightAndDay	47	99057	99046	99093	Ralph	An instinctive desire to prevent her from leaving the room made [MASK] rise at this point and begin pacing up and down the nearly empty kitchen, checking his desire, each time he reached the door, to open it and step out into the garden.
NightAndDay	55	99179	99144	99199	Mary	He was trapped by the illogicality of human life. The obstacles in the way of his desire seemed to him purely artificial, and yet he could see no way of removing them. [MASK] s words, the tone of her voice even, angered him, for she would not help him.
NightAndDay	47	99269	99248	99295	Mary	"I doubt that one human being ever understands another," he said, stopping in his march and confronting [MASK] at a distance of a few feet. "Such damned liars as we all are, how can we? But we can try.
NightAndDay	51	99388	99347	99398	Mary	Of course I behave badly; but you can t judge people by what they do. You can t go through life measuring right and wrong with a foot-rule. That s what you re always doing, [MASK]; that s what you re doing now."
NightAndDay	52	99765	99758	99810	Mary	We can only look upon ourselves, [MASK], as pioneers in a wilderness. We can only go on patiently putting the truth before them. It isn t _them_," she continued, taking heart from her sight of the traffic, "it s their leaders.
NightAndDay	45	101614	101604	101649	Mary	From an acute consciousness of herself as an individual, [MASK] passed to a conception of the scheme of things in which, as a human being, she must have her share. She half held a vision; the vision shaped and dwindled.
NightAndDay	52	101979	101942	101994	Ralph	She arranged the details of the new plan in her mind, not without a grim satisfaction. "Now," she said to herself, rising from her seat, "I ll think of [MASK]." Where was he to be placed in the new scale of life?
NightAndDay	52	102554	102546	102598	Mary	She was a little surprised to find that [MASK] had drawn her chair to the window, and, having lit the gas, she raised herself from a stooping posture and looked at her. The most obvious reason for such an attitude in a secretary was some kind of indisposition.
NightAndDay	50	102600	102582	102632	Mary	The most obvious reason for such an attitude in a secretary was some kind of indisposition. But [MASK], rousing herself with an effort, denied that she was indisposed. "I m frightfully lazy this afternoon," she added, with a glance at her table.
NightAndDay	57	102683	102674	102731	Mary	She was terribly afraid that one of these days [MASK], the young woman who typified so many rather sentimental and enthusiastic ideas, who had some sort of visionary existence in white with a sheaf of lilies in her hand, would announce, in a jaunty way, that she was about to be married.
NightAndDay	47	103032	103028	103075	Mary	She glanced furtively at [MASK], who still sat by the window with her arm upon the sill. She noticed how young she was and full of the promise of womanhood. The sight made her so uneasy that she fidgeted the cups upon their saucers.
NightAndDay	49	103087	103047	103096	Mary	She noticed how young she was and full of the promise of womanhood. The sight made her so uneasy that she fidgeted the cups upon their saucers. "Yes enough work to last a lifetime," said [MASK], as if concluding some passage of thought.
NightAndDay	51	103770	103752	103803	Mary	His eyes rested, with something of the vanity of an author, upon the yellow leaflet which [MASK] held in her hand. She rose, took her seat at the head of the table, poured out tea for her colleagues, and gave her opinion upon the leaflet.
NightAndDay	50	104004	104002	104052	Mary	No, [MASK] thought, with unflinching loyalty to what appeared to her to be the true view, having lost what is best, I do not mean to pretend that any other view does instead. Whatever happens, I mean to have no presences in my life.
NightAndDay	42	104280	104277	104319	Sally	"Look, [MASK]," she said, "these letters want copying. These I ve not looked at. The question of the new census will have to be gone into carefully. But I m going home now.
NightAndDay	46	104518	104516	104562	Mary	CHAPTER XXI [MASK] walked to the nearest station and reached home in an incredibly short space of time, just so much, indeed, as was needed for the intelligent understanding of the news of the world as the "Westminster Gazette" reported it.
NightAndDay	50	104665	104661	104711	Ralph	Oh, yes, [MASK] had come in at that point. She scored that sheet very effectively, and, choosing a fresh one, began at a great rate with a generalization upon the structure of human society, which was a good deal bolder than her custom.
NightAndDay	54	104712	104712	104766	Ralph	[MASK] had told her once that she couldn t write English, which accounted for those frequent blots and insertions; but she put all that behind her, and drove ahead with such words as came her way, until she had accomplished half a page of generalization and might legitimately draw breath.
NightAndDay	43	105170	105128	105171	Mary	She saw a tall figure outside, with something ominous to her eyes in the look of it. "What do you want?" she said, not recognizing the face in the fitful light of the staircase. "[MASK]?
NightAndDay	57	105178	105178	105235	Mary	[MASK] s self-possession returned almost excessively, and her welcome was decidedly cold, as if she must recoup herself for this ridiculous waste of emotion. She moved her green-shaded lamp to another table, and covered "Some Aspects of the Democratic State" with a sheet of blotting-paper.
NightAndDay	46	105298	105277	105323	Katharine	And, as she smoothed down the sheet of blotting-paper over the manuscript, she braced herself to resist [MASK], whose presence struck her, not merely by its force, as usual, but as something in the nature of a menace.
NightAndDay	42	105382	105364	105406	Katharine	"I didn t know you had to work after you had left the office," said [MASK], in a tone which gave the impression that she was thinking of something else, as was, indeed, the case.
NightAndDay	49	105549	105520	105569	Rodney	The flow of faces streaming on either side of her had hypnotized her into a mood of profound despondency, to which her expectation of an evening alone with [MASK] contributed. They were very good friends again, better friends, they both said, than ever before.
NightAndDay	57	105689	105656	105713	William	For, "Oh dear," she thought, looking into a tobacconist s window, "I don t care for any of them, and I don t care for [MASK], and people say this is the thing that matters most, and I can t see what they mean by it."
NightAndDay	50	106252	106230	106280	Katharine	She must be made to realize to feel. "I don t quite see," she said, as if [MASK] had challenged her explicitly, "how, things being as they are, any one can help trying, at least, to do something."
NightAndDay	51	106367	106357	106408	Katharine	As usual, when she found herself in talk with [MASK], she began to feel rapid alternations of opinion about her, arrows of sensation striking strangely through the envelope of personality, which shelters us so conveniently from our fellows. What an egoist, how aloof she was!
NightAndDay	55	106511	106477	106532	Katharine	"You ll be married, and you ll have other things to think of," she said inconsequently, and with an accent of condescension. She was not going to make [MASK] understand in a second, as she would, all she herself had learnt at the cost of such pain.
NightAndDay	55	106618	106618	106673	Katharine	[MASK] now renewed her signs of leave-taking; she had drawn on one of her gloves, and looked about her as if in search of some trivial saying to end with. Wasn t there some picture, or clock, or chest of drawers which might be singled out for notice?
NightAndDay	53	106787	106739	106792	Mary	"I think you re very lucky," she observed. "I envy you, living alone and having your own things" and engaged in this exalted way, which had no recognition or engagement-ring, she added in her own mind. [MASK] s lips parted slightly.
NightAndDay	45	106837	106810	106855	Katharine	"I don t think you ve got any reason to envy me," she said. "Perhaps one always envies other people," [MASK] observed vaguely. "Well, but you ve got everything that any one can want."
NightAndDay	57	106883	106860	106917	Mary	She gazed into the fire quietly, and without a trace of self-consciousness. The hostility which she had divined in [MASK] s tone had completely disappeared, and she forgot that she had been upon the point of going. "Well, I suppose I have," she said at length. "
NightAndDay	43	106994	106974	107017	Mary	It s not love; it s not reason; I think it must be some idea. Perhaps, [MASK], our affections are the shadow of an idea. Perhaps there isn t any such thing as affection in itself...."
NightAndDay	45	107103	107078	107123	Katharine	"I m the opposite way of thinking, you see," she said. "Yes; I know you are," [MASK] replied, looking at her as if now she were about, perhaps, to explain something very important.
NightAndDay	48	107359	107339	107387	Katharine	The color at once came to her face. "It would be a very good plan," said [MASK] in her decided way. "You think so?" "Yes, because he would do something worth while; he would write a book.
NightAndDay	53	107408	107371	107424	Mary	"Yes, because he would do something worth while; he would write a book. My father always says that he s the most remarkable of the young men who write for him." [MASK] bent low over the fire and stirred the coal between the bars with a poker.
NightAndDay	53	107603	107567	107620	Katharine	"I don t know what he means to do," she said hurriedly, seeking time against the pressure of her own conviction. "I ve not seen him since Christmas." [MASK] reflected that this was odd; perhaps, after all, she had misunderstood the position.
NightAndDay	51	107762	107754	107805	Katharine	Half a dozen words were sufficient to wake [MASK] s attention, and put flight and further silence beyond her power. But although the words came to her lips, her throat closed upon them and drove them back. After all, she considered, why should she speak?
NightAndDay	45	107933	107925	107970	Katharine	Her hand went down to the hem of [MASK] s skirt, and, fingering a line of fur, she bent her head as if to examine it. "I like this fur," she said, "I like your clothes.
NightAndDay	48	107982	107955	108003	Ralph	"I like this fur," she said, "I like your clothes. And you mustn t think that I m going to marry [MASK]," she continued, in the same tone, "because he doesn t care for me at all.
NightAndDay	51	108082	108075	108126	Katharine	"No, no," said [MASK]; "but you re mistaken, aren t you?" She was, in truth, horribly uncomfortable, dismayed, indeed, disillusioned. She disliked the turn things had taken quite intensely. The indecency of it afflicted her.
NightAndDay	47	108139	108127	108174	Mary	The suffering implied by the tone appalled her. She looked at [MASK] furtively, with eyes that were full of apprehension. But if she had hoped to find that these words had been spoken without understanding of their meaning, she was at once disappointed.
NightAndDay	54	108228	108208	108262	Mary	"There are some things, don t you think, that one can t be mistaken about?" [MASK] said, quietly and almost coldly. "That is what puzzles me about this question of being in love. I ve always prided myself upon being reasonable," she added.
NightAndDay	57	108301	108263	108320	Katharine	"I didn t think I could have felt this I mean if the other person didn t. I was foolish. I let myself pretend." Here she paused. "For, you see, [MASK]," she proceeded, rousing herself and speaking with greater energy, "I AM in love.
NightAndDay	47	108335	108321	108368	Ralph	There s no doubt about that.... I m tremendously in love... with [MASK]." The little forward shake of her head, which shook a lock of hair, together with her brighter color, gave her an appearance at once proud and defiant.
NightAndDay	45	108369	108337	108382	Katharine	" The little forward shake of her head, which shook a lock of hair, together with her brighter color, gave her an appearance at once proud and defiant. [MASK] thought to herself, "That s how it feels then."
NightAndDay	50	108419	108414	108464	Mary	"Yes," said [MASK]; "I ve got that. One wouldn t _not_ be in love.... But I didn t mean to talk about that; I only wanted you to know. There s another thing I want to tell you..."
NightAndDay	56	108475	108437	108493	Ralph	But I didn t mean to talk about that; I only wanted you to know. There s another thing I want to tell you..." She paused. "I haven t any authority from [MASK] to say it; but I m sure of this he s in love with you."
NightAndDay	52	108581	108535	108587	Katharine	No; she still frowned, as if she sought her way through the clauses of a difficult argument, but she still looked more like one who reasons than one who feels. "That proves that you re mistaken utterly mistaken," said [MASK], speaking reasonably, too.
NightAndDay	55	108938	108930	108985	Mary	In order to have produced such suffering in [MASK], it seemed to her that he must have behaved with extreme callousness. It seemed to her that he had discarded the friendship, when it suited his convenience to do so, with some falsely philosophical theory which made his conduct all the worse.
NightAndDay	49	108997	108953	109002	Mary	It seemed to her that he had discarded the friendship, when it suited his convenience to do so, with some falsely philosophical theory which made his conduct all the worse. She was going on to express herself thus, had not [MASK] at once interrupted her.
NightAndDay	46	109077	109044	109090	Ralph	It was borne in upon her how completely in running her risk she had lost her prize, lost it so entirely that she had no longer the right, in talking of [MASK], to presume that her knowledge of him supplanted all other knowledge.
NightAndDay	48	109273	109239	109287	Katharine	Tears of weakness welled up and rolled down her cheeks. But tears, at least, she could control, and would this instant, and then, turning, she would face [MASK], and retrieve what could be retrieved of the collapse of her courage.
NightAndDay	54	109445	109445	109499	Mary	[MASK] had no wish to speak. In the silence she seemed to have lost her isolation; she was at once the sufferer and the pitiful spectator of suffering; she was happier than she had ever been; she was more bereft; she was rejected, and she was immensely beloved.
NightAndDay	55	109544	109500	109555	Mary	Attempt to express these sensations was vain, and, moreover, she could not help believing that, without any words on her side, they were shared. Thus for some time longer they sat silent, side by side, while [MASK] fingered the fur on the skirt of the old dress.
NightAndDay	53	109618	109593	109646	Mary	Punctuality might have been achieved by taking a cab, had she not wished the open air to fan into flame the glow kindled by [MASK] s words. For among all the impressions of the evening s talk one was of the nature of a revelation and subdued the rest to insignificance.
NightAndDay	44	109680	109647	109691	Katharine	Thus one looked; thus one spoke; such was love. "She sat up straight and looked at me, and then she said, I m in love, " [MASK] mused, trying to set the whole scene in motion.
NightAndDay	46	110079	110056	110102	William	The little picture suggested very happily her melodious and whimsical temperament. The enthusiasms of a young girl of distinguished upbringing appealed to [MASK], and suggested a thousand ways in which, with his training and accomplishments, he could be of service to her.
NightAndDay	44	110151	110128	110172	Katharine	Moreover, from one or two remarks let fall in the course of conversation, he thought it possible that she had what [MASK] professed to lack, a passionate, if untaught, appreciation of literature. He had lent her his play.
NightAndDay	41	110268	110231	110272	Katharine	He set himself down to compose this piece of advice in a shape which was light and playful, and yet did no injury to a cause which he had near at heart, when he heard [MASK] upon the stairs.
NightAndDay	46	110288	110273	110319	Katharine	A moment later it was plain that he had been mistaken, it was not [MASK]; but he could not settle himself to his letter. His temper had changed from one of urbane contentment indeed of delicious expansion to one of uneasiness and expectation.
NightAndDay	53	110433	110407	110460	Katharine	But this possibility, after all, was not so disagreeable as the probability which forced itself upon him with every tick of the clock that [MASK] had completely forgotten her engagement. Such things had happened less frequently since Christmas, but what if they were going to begin to happen again?
NightAndDay	50	110558	110516	110566	Cassandra	He tried to fit her with each of these descriptions, but he had to own that she puzzled him. "There are so many things that she doesn t understand," he reflected, glancing at the letter to [MASK] which he had begun and laid aside.
NightAndDay	42	110586	110567	110609	Katharine	What prevented him from finishing the letter which he had so much enjoyed beginning? The reason was that [MASK] might, at any moment, enter the room. The thought, implying his bondage to her, irritated him acutely.
NightAndDay	51	110643	110597	110648	Cassandra	The thought, implying his bondage to her, irritated him acutely. It occurred to him that he would leave the letter lying open for her to see, and he would take the opportunity of telling her that he had sent his play to [MASK] for her to criticize.
NightAndDay	49	110681	110649	110698	Katharine	Possibly, but not by any means certainly, this would annoy her and as he reached the doubtful comfort of this conclusion, there was a knock on the door and [MASK] came in. They kissed each other coldly and she made no apology for being late.
NightAndDay	48	110763	110736	110784	Katharine	He let her make her own disposition of clothes and busied himself with the plates. "I ve got a piece of news for you, [MASK]," he said directly they sat down to table; "I shan t get my holiday in April.
NightAndDay	51	110807	110795	110846	Katharine	He rapped the words out with a certain degree of briskness. [MASK] started a little, as if the announcement disturbed her thoughts. "That won t make any difference, will it? I mean the lease isn t signed," she replied. "But why?
NightAndDay	53	111368	111348	111401	Katharine	Style, you know, is what we tend to neglect "; but he was far more conscious of [MASK] s eye upon him than of what he was saying about style. He knew that she was looking at him, but whether with irritation or indifference he could not guess.
NightAndDay	59	111458	111455	111514	Mary	Infinitely preferable was [MASK] s state, she thought, where there was a simple thing to do and one did it. In fact, she could not help supposing that some littleness of nature had a part in all the refinements, reserves, and subtleties of feeling for which her friends and family were so distinguished.
NightAndDay	49	112192	112165	112214	Katharine	"I m not so sure about that. I should say she has a good deal of literary feeling." "Perhaps," said [MASK] indifferently. "You ve been neglecting my education lately, by the way. I wish you d read something.
NightAndDay	41	112332	112326	112367	Mary	More and more the condition of [MASK] s mind seemed to her wonderful and enviable if, indeed, it could be quite as she figured it if, indeed, simplicity existed for any one of the daughters of women.
NightAndDay	53	112399	112399	112452	Rodney	[MASK] took the book, held it in front of him, inserted one finger between the pages, but said nothing. His face wore a queer expression of deliberation, as if he were weighing one thing with another, and would not say anything until his mind were made up.
NightAndDay	49	112453	112422	112471	Katharine	His face wore a queer expression of deliberation, as if he were weighing one thing with another, and would not say anything until his mind were made up. [MASK], taking her chair beside him, noted his silence and looked at him with sudden apprehension.
NightAndDay	49	112552	112505	112554	William	Peevishness, complaints, exacting cross-examination she was used to, but this attitude of composed quiet, which seemed to come from the consciousness of power within, puzzled her. She did not know what was going to happen next. At last [MASK] spoke.
NightAndDay	55	112772	112743	112798	Wilson	I m not saying that the most satisfactory marriages aren t founded upon this sort of understanding. But certainly it struck me as odd this morning, when [MASK] told me, how little upset I felt. By the way, you re sure we haven t committed ourselves to that house?"
NightAndDay	53	113631	113605	113658	Cassandra	He must take his time. There were so many things that he could not say without the greatest difficulty that name, for example, [MASK]. Nor could he move his eyes from a certain spot, a fiery glen surrounded by high mountains, in the heart of the coals.
NightAndDay	52	113664	113633	113685	Katharine	Nor could he move his eyes from a certain spot, a fiery glen surrounded by high mountains, in the heart of the coals. He waited in suspense for [MASK] to continue. She had said that he might be very happy with some one he loved in that way.
NightAndDay	54	113756	113703	113757	Cassandra	"I can imagine a certain sort of person " she paused; she was aware that he was listening with the greatest intentness, and that his formality was merely the cover for an extreme anxiety of some sort. There was some person then some woman who could it be? [MASK]?
NightAndDay	50	113860	113856	113906	Cassandra	It _was_ [MASK] then. Automatically and dully she replied, "You could insist that she confined herself to to something else.... But she cares for music; I believe she writes poetry; and there can be no doubt that she has a peculiar charm "
NightAndDay	52	113924	113882	113934	William	But she cares for music; I believe she writes poetry; and there can be no doubt that she has a peculiar charm " She ceased, as if defining to herself this peculiar charm. After a moment s silence [MASK] jerked out: "I thought her affectionate?"
NightAndDay	45	113987	113987	114032	William	[MASK] exclaimed, flinging himself back in his chair, and uprooting his eyes from the spot in the fire. "I really don t know what we re talking about.... I assure you...." He was covered with an extreme confusion.
NightAndDay	50	114045	114025	114075	Gulliver	He was covered with an extreme confusion. He withdrew the finger that was still thrust between the pages of [MASK], opened the book, and ran his eye down the list of chapters, as though he were about to select the one most suitable for reading aloud.
NightAndDay	50	114212	114200	114250	William	The presence of wise literary speculation, as she calculated, restored [MASK] s confidence in his security, and he replaced the book in the bookcase, keeping his back turned to her as he did so, and taking advantage of this circumstance to summon his thoughts together.
NightAndDay	51	114481	114472	114523	Katharine	"I put myself entirely in your hands, [MASK]." "You must try to tell me what you feel," she said. "My dear, I feel a thousand things every second. I don t know, I m sure, what I feel.
NightAndDay	49	114569	114524	114573	Heaven	That afternoon on the heath it was then then " He broke off; he did not tell her what had happened then. "Your ghastly good sense, as usual, has convinced me for the moment but what the truth is, [MASK] only knows!"
NightAndDay	56	114621	114606	114662	Katharine	After a moment s silence he murmured: "I believe you re right, [MASK]." She sighed, involuntarily. She had been hoping all this time, with an intensity that increased second by second against the current of her words, that it would not in the end come to this.
NightAndDay	52	115269	115219	115271	Denham	The announcement seemed to convey very little to either of his hearers. "Indeed? that s sad.... You must give me your address. But you won t cut yourself off altogether, surely " "You ll be moving, too, I suppose," [MASK] remarked.
NightAndDay	51	115357	115356	115407	Mary	What [MASK] had said she could not remember, but she felt that there was a mass of knowledge in her mind which she had not had time to examine knowledge now lying on the far side of a gulf. But her agitation flashed the queerest lights upon her past.
NightAndDay	42	115591	115566	115608	William	She was sick to death of these discussions; she shivered at the effort to reveal her feelings. She had forgotten to answer. [MASK] was speaking now. "But what will you find to do in the country?"
NightAndDay	42	115654	115644	115686	William	But directly she took up the conversation, it was [MASK] s turn to fall silent. He at once forgot to listen to what they were saying, although he interposed nervously at intervals, "Yes, yes, yes.
NightAndDay	57	115807	115788	115845	Katharine	He nodded his head, and said, nervously, "Yes, yes," and looked at [MASK], and thought how beautiful she looked; there was no one in the world that he admired more. There was an emotion in her face which lent it an expression he had never seen there.
NightAndDay	57	115884	115828	115885	Denham	There was an emotion in her face which lent it an expression he had never seen there. Then, as he was turning over means by which he could speak to her alone, she rose, and he was taken by surprise, for he had counted on the fact that she would outstay [MASK].
NightAndDay	49	116314	116280	116329	Ralph	Shall we walk on a little?" "Very well," she agreed, paying no attention to him. Aware of her preoccupation, or absorbed in his own thoughts, [MASK] said nothing further; and in silence they walked some distance along the Strand.
NightAndDay	54	116330	116330	116384	Ralph	[MASK] was doing his best to put his thoughts into such order that one came before the rest, and the determination that when he spoke he should speak worthily, made him put off the moment of speaking till he had found the exact words and even the place that best suited him.
NightAndDay	48	117365	117334	117382	Katharine	I thought then, and still think, that she cares for me. I behaved very badly. I don t defend myself." "No," said [MASK], "I should hope not. There s no defence that I can think of.
NightAndDay	55	118364	118351	118406	Denham	She was feeling happier than she had felt in her life. If [MASK] could have seen how visibly books of algebraic symbols, pages all speckled with dots and dashes and twisted bars, came before her eyes as they trod the Embankment, his secret joy in her attention might have been dispersed.
NightAndDay	56	118642	118637	118693	Denham	No feeling of annoyance with [MASK] remained; he certainly did not hinder any flight she might choose to make, whether in the direction of the sky or of her home; but that her condition was due to him, or to anything that he had said, she had no consciousness at all.
NightAndDay	48	119197	119151	119199	Kew	He guessed her difficulties; he knew in a second that she had heard nothing; he knew everything that she felt. "There s only one place to discuss things satisfactorily that I know of," he said quickly; "that s [MASK]."
NightAndDay	52	119491	119453	119505	Katharine	He felt a mixture of disgust and pity at the figure cut by human beings when they try to carry out, in practice, what they have the power to conceive. How small both he and [MASK] had appeared when they issued from the cloud of thought that enveloped them!
NightAndDay	53	119535	119506	119559	Katharine	He recalled the small, inexpressive, commonplace words in which they had tried to communicate with each other; he repeated them over to himself. By repeating [MASK] s words, he came in a few moments to such a sense of her presence that he worshipped her more than ever.
NightAndDay	53	119602	119560	119613	Rodney	But she was engaged to be married, he remembered with a start. The strength of his feeling was revealed to him instantly, and he gave himself up to an irresistible rage and sense of frustration. The image of [MASK] came before him with every circumstance of folly and indignity.
NightAndDay	47	119624	119614	119661	Katharine	That little pink-cheeked dancing-master to marry [MASK]? that gibbering ass with the face of a monkey on an organ? that posing, vain, fantastical fop? with his tragedies and his comedies, his innumerable spites and prides and pettinesses?
NightAndDay	44	120182	120181	120225	Katharine	Even [MASK] was slightly affected against her better judgment by her mother s enthusiasm. Not that her judgment could altogether acquiesce in the necessity for a study of Shakespeare s sonnets as a preliminary to the fifth chapter of her grandfather s biography.
NightAndDay	52	120796	120776	120828	Shelley	Her immediate task was to decide whether the whole letter should be printed, or only the paragraph which mentioned [MASK] s name, and she reached out for a pen and held it in readiness to do justice upon the sheet. Her pen, however, remained in the air.
NightAndDay	51	120870	120829	120880	Katharine	Almost surreptitiously she slipped a clean sheet in front of her, and her hand, descending, began drawing square boxes halved and quartered by straight lines, and then circles which underwent the same process of dissection. "[MASK]! I ve hit upon a brilliant idea!"
NightAndDay	50	121002	120954	121004	William	Your father s Hamlet, come to years of discretion; and I m well, I m a bit of them all; I m quite a large bit of the fool, but the fools in Shakespeare say all the clever things. Now who shall [MASK] be?
NightAndDay	53	121140	121137	121190	Katharine	Believe me, [MASK], you ll look back on these days afterwards; you ll remember all the silly things you ve said; and you ll find that your life has been built on them. The best of life is built on what we say when we re in love.
NightAndDay	52	121459	121411	121463	Katharine	(I never can find what I want.) But it s spring; it s the daffodils; it s the green fields; it s the birds." She was cut short in her quotation by another imperative telephone-bell. Once more [MASK] left the room.
NightAndDay	49	121580	121532	121581	Katharine	I hope he s coming to luncheon?" "He s coming to tea." "Well, that s better than nothing, and I promise to leave you alone." "There s no need for you to do that," said [MASK].
NightAndDay	55	122047	122047	122102	Cassandra	[MASK] s dislike of rational society, she said, was an affectation fast hardening into a prejudice, which would, in the long run, isolate her from all interesting people and pursuits. She was finishing the sheet when the sound she was anticipating all the time actually struck upon her ears.
NightAndDay	46	122258	122234	122280	Katharine	The thread of sound, issuing from the telephone, was always colored by the surroundings which received it, so it seemed to [MASK]. Whose voice was now going to combine with them, or to strike a discord? "Whose voice?"
NightAndDay	44	122404	122380	122424	Katharine	But I ll write it down...." With more than the usual sense of being impinged upon the point of a bayonet, [MASK] replied: "I think I could come. I ll look at my engagements.... Hold on."
NightAndDay	49	122750	122703	122752	Katharine	The blue and purple and white of the bowl, standing in a pool of variegated light on a polished Chippendale table in the drawing-room window, made her stop dead with an exclamation of pleasure. "Who is lying ill in bed, [MASK]?"
NightAndDay	56	122843	122801	122857	Katharine	There was somebody I know " she concluded, but for the moment the name of this desirable acquaintance escaped her. The best representative of the forlorn company whose day would be brightened by a bunch of anemones was, in [MASK] s opinion, the widow of a general living in the Cromwell Road.
NightAndDay	56	122954	122949	123005	Cassandra	She took her letter to [MASK] with her, meaning to post it in the first pillar-box she came to. When, however, she was fairly out of doors, and constantly invited by pillar-boxes and post-offices to slip her envelope down their scarlet throats, she forbore.
NightAndDay	51	123293	123268	123319	Katharine	But the debate was a formal skirmishing, a pastime to gain breathing-space. Like all people brought up in a tradition, [MASK] was able, within ten minutes or so, to reduce any moral difficulty to its traditional shape and solve it by the traditional answers.
NightAndDay	43	124998	124998	125041	Katharine	[MASK] set her teeth, not entirely in the metaphorical sense, for her hand, obeying the impulse towards definite action, laid firmly upon the table beside her an envelope which she had been grasping all this time in complete forgetfulness.
NightAndDay	42	125090	125070	125112	Katharine	His expression instantly changed. He did what he was on the point of doing, and then looked at [MASK] with a look which revealed enough of his confusion to show her that he was not entirely represented by his appearance.
NightAndDay	43	125676	125661	125704	Cassandra	But when he reached his office his torments began. He found a letter from [MASK] waiting for him. She had read his play, and had taken the very first opportunity to write and tell him what she thought of it.
NightAndDay	56	125757	125705	125761	William	She knew, she wrote, that her praise meant absolutely nothing; but still, she had sat up all night; she thought this, that, and the other; she was full of enthusiasm most elaborately scratched out in places, but enough was written plain to gratify [MASK] s vanity exceedingly.
NightAndDay	53	125811	125784	125837	Henry	In other ways, too, it was a very charming letter. She told him about her music, and about a Suffrage meeting to which [MASK] had taken her, and she asserted, half seriously, that she had learnt the Greek alphabet, and found it "fascinating."
NightAndDay	48	125902	125857	125905	Rodney	Didn t the letter show the most engaging compound of enthusiasm and spirit and whimsicality, all tapering into a flame of girlish freakishness, which flitted, for the rest of the morning, as a will-o -the-wisp, across [MASK] s landscape.
NightAndDay	52	126083	126064	126116	Katharine	What did she mean by her behavior? He looked up sharply from his row of little pictures. [MASK] was disposing of the American lady in far too arbitrary a fashion. Surely the victim herself must see how foolish her enthusiasms appeared in the eyes of the poet s granddaughter.
NightAndDay	49	126341	126307	126356	Katharine	But was there room for it? Must it be hung on the staircase, or should some other relic give place to do it honor? Feeling unable to decide the question, [MASK] glanced at the portrait of her grandfather, as if to ask his opinion.
NightAndDay	49	126378	126357	126406	Katharine	The artist who had painted it was now out of fashion, and by dint of showing it to visitors, [MASK] had almost ceased to see anything but a glow of faintly pleasing pink and brown tints, enclosed within a circular scroll of gilt laurel-leaves.
NightAndDay	45	126456	126420	126465	Katharine	The sensual lips were slightly parted, and gave the face an expression of beholding something lovely or miraculous vanishing or just rising upon the rim of the distance. The expression repeated itself curiously upon [MASK] s face as she gazed up into his.
NightAndDay	57	126759	126714	126771	Rodney	The depth of her own pride and love were not more apparent to her than the sense that the dead asked neither flowers nor regrets, but a share in the life which they had given her, the life which they had lived. [MASK] found her a moment later sitting beneath her grandfather s portrait.
NightAndDay	56	126795	126772	126828	William	She laid her hand on the seat next her in a friendly way, and said: "Come and sit down, [MASK]. How glad I was you were here! I felt myself getting ruder and ruder." "You are not good at hiding your feelings," he returned dryly.
NightAndDay	54	126936	126909	126963	Katharine	Indeed, he rapidly became too much at his ease to persist in a condition of cheerful neutrality. He felt his composure slipping from him. [MASK] made it seem so natural to ask her to help him, or advise him, to say straight out what he had in his mind.
NightAndDay	52	127000	126997	127049	Katharine	But, unless [MASK] began the subject of her own accord, he could not even hint he must ignore the whole affair; it was the part of a gentleman to preserve a bearing that was, as far as he could make it, the bearing of an undoubting lover.
NightAndDay	49	127206	127180	127229	Rodney	He handed her the envelope in silence. She took it, extracted the sheets, and read the letter through. The reading seemed to [MASK] to take an intolerably long time. "Yes," she observed at length, "a very charming letter."
NightAndDay	47	127230	127214	127261	Rodney	"Yes," she observed at length, "a very charming letter." [MASK] s face was half turned away, as if in bashfulness. Her view of his profile almost moved her to laughter. She glanced through the pages once more.
NightAndDay	49	127269	127243	127292	William	Her view of his profile almost moved her to laughter. She glanced through the pages once more. "I see no harm," [MASK] blurted out, "in helping her with Greek, for example if she really cares for that sort of thing."
NightAndDay	50	127567	127529	127579	Cassandra	For an instant it seemed to her impossible to surrender an intimacy, which might not be the intimacy of love, but was certainly the intimacy of true friendship, to any woman in the world. [MASK] would never understand him she was not good enough for him.
NightAndDay	58	127636	127580	127638	Cassandra	The letter seemed to her a letter of flattery a letter addressed to his weakness, which it made her angry to think was known to another. For he was not weak; he had the rare strength of doing what he promised she had only to speak, and he would never think of [MASK] again.
NightAndDay	53	128039	128010	128063	Cassandra	"As I told you last night," she said, "I think it s your duty, if there s a chance that you care for [MASK], to discover what your feeling is for her now. It s your duty to her, as well as to me.
NightAndDay	56	128092	128051	128107	Rodney	It s your duty to her, as well as to me. But we must tell my mother. We can t go on pretending." "That is entirely in your hands, of course," said [MASK], with an immediate return to the manner of a formal man of honor.
NightAndDay	59	128478	128429	128488	Rodney	He s not the courage to manage it without my help he s too much of a coward to tell me openly what he wants. He hates the notion of a public breach. He wants to keep us both." When she reached this point, [MASK] pocketed the letter and elaborately looked at his watch.
NightAndDay	55	128545	128538	128593	Katharine	He was forced to go, leaving [MASK] free, as he had said, to tell her mother that the engagement was at an end. But to do what plain duty required of an honorable man, cost an effort which only a day or two ago would have been inconceivable to him.
NightAndDay	48	128851	128804	128852	Katharine	he exclaimed passionately, but withdrew his hand and turned his back. When he faced her, she thought that she saw him for the first time without disguise. "It s useless to pretend that I don t understand what you re offering, [MASK].
NightAndDay	49	128970	128960	129009	Katharine	"It would mean for we must face it, [MASK] that we let our engagement stand for the time nominally; in fact, of course, your freedom would be absolute." "And yours too." "Yes, we should both be free.
NightAndDay	52	129016	129010	129062	Cassandra	Let us say that I saw [MASK] once, twice, perhaps, under these conditions; and then if, as I think certain, the whole thing proves a dream, we tell your mother instantly. Why not tell her now, indeed, under pledge of secrecy?"
NightAndDay	50	129124	129092	129142	Rodney	This secrecy is detestable it s dishonorable." "My father would understand even less than my mother." "Ah, who could be expected to understand?" [MASK] groaned; "but it s from your point of view that we must look at it.
NightAndDay	50	129252	129251	129301	Katharine	"[MASK], you mind? You ll mind too much." "No I shan t," she said stoutly. "I shall mind a good deal, but I m prepared for that; I shall get through it, because you will help me.
NightAndDay	52	129482	129464	129516	Katharine	He was not debased in his own eyes by what he had done, and as for praising [MASK], were they not partners, conspirators, people bent upon the same quest together, so that to praise the pursuit of a common end as an act of generosity was meaningless.
NightAndDay	46	130791	130759	130805	Chelsea	He did this with the peculiar touch of the botanist. In naming the little green plant to her he used the Latin name, thus disguising some flower familiar even to [MASK], and making her exclaim, half in amusement, at his knowledge.
NightAndDay	47	131023	131013	131060	Katharine	No discourse could have worn a more welcome sound in [MASK] s ears. For weeks she had heard nothing that made such pleasant music in her mind. It wakened echoes in all those remote fastnesses of her being where loneliness had brooded so long undisturbed.
NightAndDay	49	131494	131483	131532	Denham	The far-away look entirely lacked self-consciousness. [MASK] doubted whether she remembered his presence. He could recall himself, of course, by a word or a movement but why? She was happier thus. She needed nothing that he could give her.
NightAndDay	45	131627	131620	131665	Katharine	But though she did not speak, [MASK] had an uneasy sense that silence on her part was selfishness. It was selfish of her to continue, as she wished to do, a discussion of subjects not remotely connected with any human beings.
NightAndDay	54	131874	131831	131885	Katharine	They retraced their steps in the preoccupied manner of people who have to think about something that is lost. What did this bag look like? What did it contain? "A purse a ticket some letters, papers," [MASK] counted, becoming more agitated as she recalled the list.
NightAndDay	41	131886	131886	131927	Denham	[MASK] went on quickly in advance of her, and she heard him shout that he had found it before she reached the seat. In order to make sure that all was safe she spread the contents on her knee.
NightAndDay	56	131934	131928	131984	Denham	It was a queer collection, [MASK] thought, gazing with the deepest interest. Loose gold coins were tangled in a narrow strip of lace; there were letters which somehow suggested the extreme of intimacy; there were two or three keys, and lists of commissions against which crosses were set at intervals.
NightAndDay	52	132709	132660	132712	Denham	An occasional man with a beard is interesting; he s detached; he lets me go my way, and we know we shall never meet again. Therefore, we are perfectly sincere a thing not possible with one s friends." "Nonsense," [MASK] replied abruptly.
NightAndDay	42	133230	133207	133249	Katharine	a creature of uncalculating passion and instinctive freedom? No; he refused to believe it. It was in her loneliness that [MASK] was unreserved. "I went back to my room by myself and I did what I liked.
NightAndDay	51	133439	133390	133441	Denham	He had spoken of gratitude and acquiescence in the letter which he had never sent, and now all the force of his character must make good those vows in her presence. She, thus challenged, tried meanwhile to define her points. She wished to make [MASK] understand.
NightAndDay	52	134444	134422	134474	Denham	Was this not the chance he offered her the rare and wonderful chance of friendship? At any rate, she told [MASK], with a sigh in which he heard both impatience and relief, that she agreed; she thought him right; she would accept his terms of friendship.
NightAndDay	56	135198	135182	135238	Cassandra	The terrible results which governesses had predicted from such mental dissipation were certainly apparent now that [MASK] was twenty-two, and had never passed an examination, and daily showed herself less and less capable of passing one. The more serious prediction that she could never possibly earn her living was also verified.
NightAndDay	57	135248	135223	135280	Cassandra	The more serious prediction that she could never possibly earn her living was also verified. But from all these short strands of different accomplishments [MASK] wove for herself an attitude, a cast of mind, which, if useless, was found by some people to have the not despicable virtues of vivacity and freshness.
NightAndDay	54	135964	135938	135992	Katharine	I must write the man s name down at once, or I shall forget " Whose name, what book, which life was changed [MASK] proceeded to ascertain. She began to lay aside her clothes hurriedly, for she was very late. "May I sit and watch you?"
NightAndDay	52	136067	136051	136103	Cassandra	"There are people dining here," she said, taking in the effect of [MASK] from a new point of view. After an interval, the distinction, the irregular charm, of the small face with its long tapering nose and its bright oval eyes were very notable.
NightAndDay	57	136153	136104	136161	Cassandra	The hair rose up off the forehead rather stiffly, and, given a more careful treatment by hairdressers and dressmakers, the light angular figure might possess a likeness to a French lady of distinction in the eighteenth century. "Who s coming to dinner?" [MASK] asked, anticipating further possibilities of rapture.
NightAndDay	45	136214	136188	136233	Katharine	Did he tell you that he sent me his manuscript? I think it s wonderful I think he s almost good enough for you, [MASK]." "You shall sit next to him and tell him what you think of him."
NightAndDay	53	136243	136217	136270	Cassandra	"You shall sit next to him and tell him what you think of him." "I shan t dare do that," [MASK] asserted. "Why? You re not afraid of him, are you?" "A little because he s connected with you."
NightAndDay	50	136271	136260	136310	Katharine	"A little because he s connected with you." [MASK] smiled. "But then, with your well-known fidelity, considering that you re staying here at least a fortnight, you won t have any illusions left about me by the time you go.
NightAndDay	53	136317	136275	136328	Cassandra	But then, with your well-known fidelity, considering that you re staying here at least a fortnight, you won t have any illusions left about me by the time you go. I give you a week, [MASK]. I shall see my power fading day by day.
NightAndDay	49	136362	136347	136396	Cassandra	What am I to wear, I wonder? Find me a blue dress, [MASK], over there in the long wardrobe." She spoke disconnectedly, handling brush and comb, and pulling out the little drawers in her dressing-table and leaving them open.
NightAndDay	47	136397	136372	136419	Cassandra	She spoke disconnectedly, handling brush and comb, and pulling out the little drawers in her dressing-table and leaving them open. [MASK], sitting on the bed behind her, saw the reflection of her cousin s face in the looking-glass.
NightAndDay	49	136580	136538	136587	Katharine	It was all in keeping with the room and the house, and the city round them; for her ears had not yet ceased to notice the hum of distant wheels. They went downstairs rather late, in spite of [MASK] s extreme speed in getting ready.
NightAndDay	47	137222	137176	137223	William	He rather thought he did both. He was told that he had made a most dangerous confession. She could deduce his entire history from that one fact. He challenged her to proceed; and she proclaimed him a Liberal Member of Parliament. [MASK],
NightAndDay	51	137324	137309	137360	William	"There s no doubt what _you_ do in a railway carriage, [MASK]," she said, making use in her pleasure of his first name. "You never _once_ look out of the window; you read _all_ the time."
NightAndDay	55	137588	137535	137590	Shakespeare	"First of all," she proceeded, "I want to know why you chose to write a play?" "Ah! You mean it s not dramatic?" "I mean that I don t see what it would gain by being acted. But then does [MASK] gain?
NightAndDay	41	137663	137653	137694	Henry	"I was hoping you were on that side. [MASK] s wrong entirely wrong. Of course, I ve failed, as all the moderns fail. Dear, dear, I wish I d consulted you before."
NightAndDay	49	137715	137669	137718	Rodney	Of course, I ve failed, as all the moderns fail. Dear, dear, I wish I d consulted you before." From this point they proceeded to go over, as far as memory served them, the different aspects of [MASK] s drama.
NightAndDay	43	137741	137719	137762	Rodney	She said nothing that jarred upon him, and untrained daring had the power to stimulate experience to such an extent that [MASK] was frequently seen to hold his fork suspended before him, while he debated the first principles of the art.
NightAndDay	44	137836	137815	137859	William	"You ve not read The Idiot !" she exclaimed. "I ve read War and Peace ," [MASK] replied, a little testily. "_War and Peace_!" she echoed, in a tone of derision.
NightAndDay	47	137933	137887	137934	Dickens	"Neither do I. And I hazard the opinion that they don t themselves." The old gentleman had ruled a large part of the Indian Empire, but he was in the habit of saying that he had rather have written the works of [MASK].
NightAndDay	56	138459	138439	138495	Cassandra	Come, let us find something more cheerful to talk about upstairs." Upstairs in the drawing-room [MASK] found fresh sources of pleasure, first in the distinguished and expectant look of the room, and then in the chance of exercising her divining-rod upon a new assortment of human beings.
NightAndDay	51	138786	138777	138828	Cassandra	"I utterly refuse to tell you!" [MASK] replied, standing up straight, clasping her hands in front of her, and facing him. Her mockery was delicious to him. He had not even for a second the fear that she had been laughing at him.
NightAndDay	51	138947	138923	138974	Katharine	she cried. "Not for a second. We both know that you ve been enjoying yourself immensely. Hasn t he, [MASK]?" "No," she replied, "I think he s speaking the truth. He doesn t care much for politics."
NightAndDay	44	138993	138966	139010	William	He doesn t care much for politics." Her words, though spoken simply, produced a curious change in the light, sparkling atmosphere. [MASK] at once lost his look of animation and said seriously: "I detest politics."
NightAndDay	47	139294	139293	139340	Henry	"[MASK]," she said next moment, "would say that a stage ought to be no bigger than this drawing-room. He wants there to be singing and dancing as well as acting only all the opposite of Wagner you understand?"
NightAndDay	44	139378	139378	139422	Katharine	[MASK] s duty, whether it was to pull a curtain or move a chair, was either forgotten or discharged, but she continued to stand by the window without doing anything. The elderly people were all grouped together round the fire.
NightAndDay	45	139564	139527	139572	Katharine	Cabs were passing, and couples were loitering slowly along the road, keeping as close to the railings as possible, though the trees had as yet no leaves to cast shadow upon their embraces. [MASK], thus withdrawn, felt her loneliness.
NightAndDay	48	139983	139953	140001	Katharine	I couldn t see where you d got to our children," he observed parenthetically, "have their uses I want you to go to my study, [MASK]; go to the third shelf on the right-hand side of the door; take down
NightAndDay	50	140140	140113	140163	Cassandra	He rose, after a second s hesitation, and she understood that it cost him an effort. She knelt one knee upon the sofa where [MASK] sat, looking down at her cousin s face, which still moved with the speed of what she had been saying.
NightAndDay	52	140281	140268	140320	Katharine	"Ah, but it s only ten o clock," said [MASK] darkly. "As late as that! Well ?" She did not understand. "At twelve my horses turn into rats and off I go. The illusion fades. But I accept my fate.
NightAndDay	48	140330	140290	140338	Cassandra	Well ?" She did not understand. "At twelve my horses turn into rats and off I go. The illusion fades. But I accept my fate. I make hay while the sun shines." [MASK] looked at her with a puzzled expression.
NightAndDay	48	140380	140373	140421	Katharine	Can you make her out?" [MASK] perceived from his little frown and hesitation that he did not find that particular problem to his taste at present. She stood upright at once and said in a different tone: "I really am off, though.
NightAndDay	47	140432	140402	140449	William	She stood upright at once and said in a different tone: "I really am off, though. I wish you d explain if they say anything, [MASK]. I shan t be late, but I ve got to see some one."
NightAndDay	52	140470	140461	140513	William	"Whom have you got to see?" [MASK] demanded. "A friend," she remarked, half turning her head towards him. She knew that he wished her to stay, not, indeed, with them, but in their neighborhood, in case of need.
NightAndDay	50	140788	140746	140796	Mary	The apparition of an unknown lady in full evening dress seemed to disturb him. He took his pipe from his mouth, rose stiffly, and sat down again with a jerk. "Have you been dining out?" [MASK] asked. "Are you working?"
NightAndDay	54	140861	140842	140896	Mary	We were going through them, but we d almost done.... Tell us about your party." [MASK] had a ruffled appearance, as if she had been running her fingers through her hair in the course of her conversation; she was dressed more or less like a Russian peasant girl.
NightAndDay	59	141066	141008	141067	Capital	In connection with the rest of the group of very able young men he had drawn up a scheme for the education of labor, for the amalgamation of the middle class and the working class, and for a joint assault of the two bodies, combined in the Society for the Education of Democracy, upon [MASK].
NightAndDay	56	141099	141068	141124	Mary	The scheme had already reached the stage in which it was permissible to hire an office and engage a secretary, and he had been deputed to expound the scheme to [MASK], and make her an offer of the Secretaryship, to which, as a matter of principle, a small salary was attached.
NightAndDay	53	141419	141376	141429	Katharine	"You ve been dining out?" she asked again, looking, with a little smile, at the blue silk and the pearl-sewn shoes. "No, at home. Are you starting something new?" [MASK] hazarded, rather hesitatingly, looking at the papers.
NightAndDay	49	141665	141665	141714	Katharine	[MASK] felt that in this company anything that one said would be judged upon its merits; one had only to say what one thought, rather barely and tersely, with a curious assumption that the number of things that could properly be thought about was strictly limited.
NightAndDay	48	141918	141872	141920	Mary	If you don t want a mutual admiration society, which dies as soon as you ve all discovered each other s faults, you must nobble the Press. You must appeal to the public." "That s the difficulty," said [MASK] thoughtfully.
NightAndDay	55	142000	141955	142010	Katharine	She can make a whole-time job of it. I m tied to an office; I can only give my spare time. Are you, by any chance, on the look-out for a job?" he asked [MASK], with a queer mixture of distrust and deference.
NightAndDay	43	142636	142626	142669	Mary	"It s not a question of friendship," [MASK] exclaimed, her anger rising, to her own surprise. "You know it s not. How can it be? I ve no right to interfere " She stopped.
NightAndDay	48	142968	142923	142971	Katharine	Their animosity had completely disappeared, and upon both of them a cloud of difficulty and darkness rested, obscuring the future, in which they had both to find a way. "No, no, it s not worth it," [MASK] repeated. "
NightAndDay	56	143116	143105	143161	Mary	"I don t lay down any rules," said [MASK], recovering herself first, as they turned after a long pause of this description. "All I say is that you should know what you re about for certain; but," she added, "I expect you do."
NightAndDay	41	143181	143162	143203	Katharine	At the same time she was profoundly perplexed, not only by what she knew of the arrangements for [MASK] s marriage, but by the impression which she had of her, there on her arm, dark and inscrutable.
NightAndDay	53	143240	143232	143285	Katharine	"You must go in," said [MASK], rousing herself. "He s waiting all this time to go on with his reading." She glanced up at the lighted window near the top of the house, and they both looked at it and waited for a moment.
NightAndDay	53	143593	143560	143613	Mary	He had been re-reading the document, and making pencil notes in the margin while he waited, and he went on again as if there had been no interruption. [MASK] sat down among the flat cushions, lit another cigarette, and listened with a frown upon her face.
NightAndDay	49	143861	143817	143866	Katharine	She thought he looked as if he were in some mood of high exaltation, which it made her uncomfortable to witness any longer unseen. She stepped into the hall. He gave a great start upon seeing her and stopped. "[MASK]!" he exclaimed.
NightAndDay	49	143976	143928	143977	Katharine	He was scarcely addressing her, and she said nothing. For a moment they stood at opposite sides of a table saying nothing. Then he asked her quickly, "But tell me, how did it seem to you? What did you think, [MASK]?
NightAndDay	49	144037	144013	144062	Katharine	He started back, walked rapidly into the hall, and said in a loud and ostentatiously ordinary tone: "Good night, [MASK]. Go to bed now. I shall see you soon. I hope I shall be able to come to-morrow."
NightAndDay	51	144074	144050	144101	Cassandra	I hope I shall be able to come to-morrow." Next moment he was gone. She went upstairs and found [MASK] on the landing. She held two or three books in her hand, and she was stooping to look at others in a little bookcase.
NightAndDay	55	144133	144079	144134	Katharine	She held two or three books in her hand, and she was stooping to look at others in a little bookcase. She said that she could never tell which book she wanted to read in bed, poetry, biography, or metaphysics. "What do you read in bed, [MASK]?
NightAndDay	46	145090	145079	145125	William	She had even come provided with a ticket for him. [MASK] s objection that he would not be admitted was, therefore, silenced directly. But the way in which the two men greeted each other was significant of what was going to happen.
NightAndDay	56	145220	145211	145267	Cassandra	It was clear that he was irritated, and [MASK] felt for his annoyance. They were standing by the pen of some Oriental hog, and she was prodding the brute gently with the point of her umbrella, when a thousand little observations seemed, in some way, to collect in one center.
NightAndDay	42	145482	145471	145513	Ralph	"What have you been doing since we met?" [MASK] asked at length. "Doing?" she pondered. "Walking in and out of other people s houses. I wonder if these animals are happy?"
NightAndDay	48	145580	145558	145606	Ralph	"No. But he ll soon get over that," she replied. The detachment expressed by her voice puzzled [MASK], and he would have been glad if she had explained her meaning further. But he was not going to press her for explanations.
NightAndDay	53	145892	145871	145924	Circumstances	He wished to keep this distance between them the distance which separates the devotee from the image in the shrine. [MASK] conspired to make this easier than it would have been, had they been seated in a drawing-room, for example, with a tea-tray between them.
NightAndDay	46	146441	146430	146476	Cassandra	"Which is the way to the Reptile House?" [MASK] asked him, not from a genuine desire to visit the reptiles, but in obedience to her new-born feminine susceptibility, which urged her to charm and conciliate the other sex.
NightAndDay	52	146723	146706	146758	William	They were professedly looking into the enormous central cage of monkeys, and being thoroughly annoyed by [MASK], she compared him to a wretched misanthropical ape, huddled in a scrap of old shawl at the end of a pole, darting peevish glances of suspicion and distrust at his companions.
NightAndDay	47	146914	146876	146923	Katharine	"Why did you say that just now about my behavior to animals?" As he spoke he rattled his stick against the bars of the cage, which gave his words an accompaniment peculiarly exasperating to [MASK] s nerves. "Because it s true.
NightAndDay	49	146954	146924	146973	William	You never see what any one feels," she said. "You think of no one but yourself." "That is not true," said [MASK]. By his determined rattling he had now collected the animated attention of some half-dozen apes.
NightAndDay	56	147025	146974	147030	Katharine	Either to propitiate them, or to show his consideration for their feelings, he proceeded to offer them the apple which he held. The sight, unfortunately, was so comically apt in its illustration of the picture in her mind, the ruse was so transparent, that [MASK] was seized with laughter.
NightAndDay	51	147166	147145	147196	Rodney	Some change had come over her. He connected it with her laughter, and her few words in private with [MASK]; he felt that she had become unfriendly to him. She talked, but her remarks were indifferent, and when he spoke her attention seemed to wander.
NightAndDay	53	147307	147276	147329	Katharine	In his surprise at the suddenness of the change, and at the extent of his freedom, he bethought him of a daring plan, by which the ghost of [MASK] could be more effectually exorcised than by mere abstinence. He would ask her to come home with him to tea.
NightAndDay	48	147859	147820	147868	Ralph	As they listened to the shaking of the bell in the basement, she could summon no vision to replace the one so rudely destroyed. "I must warn you to expect a family party," said [MASK]. "They re mostly in on Sundays.
NightAndDay	51	147911	147910	147961	Ralph	While [MASK] took off his coat, she had time to notice the ferns and photographs and draperies, and to hear a hum, or rather a babble, of voices talking each other down, from the sound of them. The rigidity of extreme shyness came over her.
NightAndDay	55	147967	147962	148017	Denham	She kept as far behind [MASK] as she could, and walked stiffly after him into a room blazing with unshaded lights, which fell upon a number of people, of different ages, sitting round a large dining-room table untidily strewn with food, and unflinchingly lit up by incandescent gas.
NightAndDay	58	148164	148117	148175	Katharine	If one of you could invent a good spirit-lamp " she sighed, looking generally down the table, and then began seeking among the china before her for two clean cups for the new-comers. The unsparing light revealed more ugliness than [MASK] had seen in one room for a very long time.
NightAndDay	49	148379	148355	148404	Johnnie	We did try drawing-room tea, but it didn t do." A boy of sixteen, who appeared to be [MASK], grumbled derisively both at the notion of drawing-room tea and at the necessity of carrying a tray up to his brother.
NightAndDay	56	148440	148405	148461	Katharine	But he took himself off, being enjoined by his mother to mind what he was doing, and shut the door after him. "It s much nicer like this," said [MASK], applying herself with determination to the dissection of her cake; they had given her too large a slice.
NightAndDay	45	148739	148702	148747	Hester	She spoke with such emphasis that it was quite obvious that she expressed unpopular views, and that her children disagreed with her. "The ceiling s fallen down in the pantry again," said [MASK], a girl of eighteen, abruptly.
NightAndDay	41	148809	148772	148813	Katharine	"It s only a little bit of plaster I don t see how any house could be expected to stand the wear and tear you give it." Here some family joke exploded, which [MASK] could not follow.
NightAndDay	56	148944	148913	148969	Ralph	She glanced along a mantelpiece ranged with bronze chariots, silver vases, and china ornaments that were either facetious or eccentric. She did not apply her judgment consciously to [MASK], but when she looked at him, a moment later, she rated him lower than at any other time of their acquaintanceship.
NightAndDay	53	149360	149317	149370	Joan	There s nothing left for you to eat," broke up the oppressive concentration of so many eyes upon the table-cloth, and set the waters of family life dashing in brisk little waves again. It was obvious that [MASK] had some mysterious and beneficent power upon her family.
NightAndDay	58	149375	149371	149429	Katharine	She went up to [MASK] as if she had heard of her, and was very glad to see her at last. She explained that she had been visiting an uncle who was ill, and that had kept her. No, she hadn t had any tea, but a slice of bread would do.
NightAndDay	52	149925	149925	149977	Johnnie	[MASK] messes with stinking chemicals in the pantry " They appealed to her, and she forgot her cake and began to laugh and talk and argue with sudden animation. The large family seemed to her so warm and various that she forgot to censure them for their taste in pottery.
NightAndDay	59	150163	150137	150196	Katharine	They were very well matched, and held the opposite views. But at the most exciting stage of the argument, for no reason that [MASK] could see, all chairs were pushed back, and one after another the Denham family got up and went out of the door, as if a bell had summoned them.
NightAndDay	44	150523	150504	150548	Katharine	She s only ten. But they re always arguing among themselves." He was immensely pleased by [MASK] s praise of his brothers and sisters. He would have liked to go on telling her about them, but he checked himself.
NightAndDay	47	150562	150549	150596	Katharine	"I see that it must be difficult to leave them," [MASK] continued. His deep pride in his family was more evident to him, at that moment, than ever before, and the idea of living alone in a cottage was ridiculous.
NightAndDay	49	150666	150663	150712	Katharine	And it was [MASK] who had opened his eyes to this, he thought. A little dry chirp from the corner of the room now roused her attention. "My tame rook," he explained briefly. "A cat had bitten one of its legs.
NightAndDay	49	150906	150885	150934	William	" She settled upon the arm of the chair irresolutely, thinking that she had no wish to go home. [MASK] would be there, and he would find some way of making things unpleasant for her, and the memory of their quarrel came back to her.
NightAndDay	54	150938	150935	150989	Ralph	She had noticed [MASK] s coldness, too. She looked at him, and from his fixed stare she thought that he must be working out some theory, some argument. He had thought, perhaps, of some fresh point in his position, as to the bounds of personal liberty.
NightAndDay	50	151280	151269	151319	Ralph	We shall gain nothing but unhappiness. Look at me, [MASK]." He looked at her. "I assure you that I m far more ordinary than I appear. Beauty means nothing whatever. In fact, the most beautiful women are generally the most stupid.
NightAndDay	49	151824	151793	151842	William	"It may be put off even longer than that," she said, as if by an afterthought. "Some one in the office is ill, and [MASK] has to take his place. We may put it off for some time in fact."
NightAndDay	47	151856	151831	151878	Ralph	We may put it off for some time in fact." "That s rather hard on him, isn t it?" [MASK] asked. "He has his work," she replied. "He has lots of things that interest him....
NightAndDay	48	152104	152097	152145	Ralph	"And forgetting your purse," [MASK] added. At this she smiled, but in another moment her smile faded, either because of his words or of the way in which he spoke them. She was capable of forgetting things. He saw that.
NightAndDay	48	152893	152860	152908	Katharine	He possessed a book of photographs from the Greek statues; the head of a goddess, if the lower part were concealed, had often given him the ecstasy of being in [MASK] s presence. He took it down from the shelf and found the picture.
NightAndDay	48	152935	152897	152945	Kew	He took it down from the shelf and found the picture. To this he added a note from her, bidding him meet her at the Zoo. He had a flower which he had picked at [MASK] to teach her botany. Such were his relics.
NightAndDay	45	153565	153530	153575	Mary	As he rang her bell, he seemed to himself to be announcing the presence of something wonderful that was separate from himself, and gave him power and authority over all other people. [MASK] came to the door after a moment s pause.
NightAndDay	45	153633	153591	153636	Ralph	He followed her into her room. "Do you know each other?" she said, to his extreme surprise, for he had counted on finding her alone. A young man rose, and said that he knew [MASK] by sight.
NightAndDay	55	153831	153826	153881	Mary	"D you know, [MASK]," he suddenly remarked, "I believe I m in for a cold. Have you any quinine?" The look which he cast at her frightened her; it expressed mutely, perhaps without his own consciousness, something deep, wild, and passionate.
NightAndDay	44	153897	153882	153926	Ralph	She left the room at once. Her heart beat fast at the knowledge of [MASK] s presence; but it beat with pain, and with an extraordinary fear. She stood listening for a moment to the voices in the next room.
NightAndDay	55	154361	154308	154363	Ralph	She hummed a scrap of a tune under her breath, and moved about the room as if she were occupied in making things tidy, and had no other concern. "You ll stay and dine?" she said casually, returning to her seat. "No," [MASK] replied.
NightAndDay	54	154543	154526	154580	Ralph	She spoke in the most impersonal manner. "I may be out of town," [MASK] replied, with equal distance of manner. "Our executive meets every week, of course," she observed. "But some of our members don t come more than once a month.
NightAndDay	52	154639	154601	154653	Ralph	She went on sewing in silence. "You ve not taken your quinine," she said, looking up and seeing the tabloids upon the mantelpiece. "I don t want it," said [MASK] shortly. "Well, you know best," she replied tranquilly.
NightAndDay	52	154655	154654	154706	Mary	"[MASK], I m a brute!" he exclaimed. "Here I come and waste your time, and do nothing but make myself disagreeable." "A cold coming on does make one feel wretched," she replied. "I ve not got a cold.
NightAndDay	49	154754	154707	154756	Mary	That was a lie. There s nothing the matter with me. I m mad, I suppose. I ought to have had the decency to keep away. But I wanted to see you I wanted to tell you I m in love, [MASK]."
NightAndDay	50	154792	154783	154833	Ralph	she said quietly. "I m glad, [MASK]." "I suppose I m in love. Anyhow, I m out of my mind. I can t think, I can t work, I don t care a hang for anything in the world.
NightAndDay	50	154932	154906	154956	Mary	Can you make any sense of it? Can you see what s happened? I m raving, I know; don t listen, [MASK]; go on with your work." He rose and began, as usual, to pace up and down the room.
NightAndDay	56	154975	154957	155013	Mary	He knew that what he had just said bore very little resemblance to what he felt, for [MASK] s presence acted upon him like a very strong magnet, drawing from him certain expressions which were not those he made use of when he spoke to himself, nor did they represent his deepest feelings.
NightAndDay	45	155058	155045	155090	Ralph	"You make me so " She spoke with unusual irritability, and [MASK], noticing it with surprise, sat down at once. "You haven t told me her name you d rather not, I suppose?" "Her name?
NightAndDay	56	155185	155182	155238	Ralph	She looked at [MASK] blankly, with a kind of awe in her face, her lips slightly parted, and her brows raised. He was apparently quite unconscious of her gaze. Then, as if she could look no longer, she leant back in her chair, and half closed her eyes.
NightAndDay	48	155376	155355	155403	Mary	"You could see her no, that s not what I want; you mustn t bother about me, [MASK]." He, too, spoke very gently. "I m afraid no third person can do anything to help," she added.
NightAndDay	45	155414	155379	155424	Katharine	He, too, spoke very gently. "I m afraid no third person can do anything to help," she added. "No," he shook his head. "[MASK] was saying to-day how lonely we are.
NightAndDay	58	155434	155425	155483	Katharine	" She saw the effort with which he spoke [MASK] s name, and believed that he forced himself to make amends now for his concealment in the past. At any rate, she was conscious of no anger against him; but rather of a deep pity for one condemned to suffer as she had suffered.
NightAndDay	43	155514	155500	155543	Ralph	"There s always work," she said, a little aggressively. [MASK] moved directly. "Do you want to be working now?" he asked. "No, no. It s Sunday," she replied.
NightAndDay	49	155549	155531	155580	Katharine	"No, no. It s Sunday," she replied. "I was thinking of [MASK]. She doesn t understand about work. She s never had to. She doesn t know what work is. I ve only found out myself quite lately.
NightAndDay	49	155684	155671	155720	Ralph	I tell you, work is the only thing that saved me, [MASK]." He set his mouth, as if her words rained blows on him; he looked as if he had made up his mind to bear anything she might say, in silence.
NightAndDay	44	155846	155824	155868	Mary	he exclaimed. But her head was turned away, and he could not say what he wished to say. "[MASK], you re splendid," he concluded. She faced him as he spoke, and gave him her hand.
NightAndDay	51	156268	156220	156271	Rodney	But the desire to communicate something of the very greatest importance possessed him completely; he still wished to bestow this gift upon some other human being; he sought their company. More by instinct than by conscious choice, he took the direction which led to [MASK] s rooms.
NightAndDay	59	156299	156289	156348	Rodney	It took him some time to accept the fact that [MASK] was out. When he could no longer pretend that the sound of the wind in the old building was the sound of some one rising from his chair, he ran downstairs again, as if his goal had been altered and only just revealed to him.
NightAndDay	55	156603	156599	156654	Ralph	The unhappy voice afflicted [MASK], but it also angered him. And when the elderly man refused to listen and mumbled on, an odd image came to his mind of a lighthouse besieged by the flying bodies of lost birds, who were dashed senseless, by the gale, against the glass.
NightAndDay	51	156802	156754	156805	Katharine	In his state of physical fatigue, details merged themselves in the vaster prospect, of which the flying gloom and the intermittent lights of lamp-posts and private houses were the outward token, but he never lost his sense of walking in the direction of [MASK] s house.
NightAndDay	56	156985	156976	157032	Ralph	The space of the room behind became, in [MASK] s vision, the center of the dark, flying wilderness of the world; the justification for the welter of confusion surrounding it; the steady light which cast its beams, like those of a lighthouse, with searching composure over the trackless waste.
NightAndDay	56	157155	157100	157156	Katharine	Its purpose was beneficent; and yet so far above his level as to have something austere about it, a light that cast itself out and yet kept itself aloof. Then he began, in his mind, to distinguish different individuals within, consciously refusing as yet to attack the figure of [MASK].
NightAndDay	51	158081	158051	158102	Rodney	"Did you stay long after we d left?" he asked abruptly. "No. We went back to my house." This seemed to confirm [MASK] s belief that he had been discussed. He turned over the unpalatable idea for a while, in silence.
NightAndDay	49	158146	158143	158192	Rodney	He could read [MASK], too, like a book. He knew that he was unhappy, and he pitied him, and wished to help him. "You say something and they fly into a passion. Or for no reason at all, they laugh.
NightAndDay	46	158285	158282	158328	Katharine	But he and [MASK] were alone together, aloft, splendid, and luminous with a twofold radiance. He pitied the unstable creature beside him; he felt a desire to protect him, exposed without the knowledge which made his own way so direct.
NightAndDay	50	158376	158329	158379	Denham	They were united as the adventurous are united, though one reaches the goal and the other perishes by the way. "You couldn t laugh at some one you cared for." This sentence, apparently addressed to no other human being, reached [MASK] s ears.
NightAndDay	44	158394	158380	158424	Rodney	The wind seemed to muffle it and fly away with it directly. Had [MASK] spoken those words? "You love her." Was that his own voice, which seemed to sound in the air several yards in front of him?
NightAndDay	48	158431	158405	158453	Denham	Was that his own voice, which seemed to sound in the air several yards in front of him? "I ve suffered tortures, [MASK], tortures!" "Yes, yes, I know that." "She s laughed at me."
NightAndDay	51	158494	158446	158497	Denham	"She s laughed at me." "Never to me." The wind blew a space between the words blew them so far away that they seemed unspoken. "How I ve loved her!" This was certainly spoken by the man at [MASK] s side.
NightAndDay	49	158597	158597	158646	Rodney	[MASK] exclaimed something inarticulate. "Ah, I ve always known it," he cried, "I ve known it from the first. You ll marry her!" The cry had a note of despair in it. Again the wind intercepted their words.
NightAndDay	53	158669	158624	158677	Denham	You ll marry her!" The cry had a note of despair in it. Again the wind intercepted their words. They said no more. At length they drew up beneath a lamp-post, simultaneously. "My God, [MASK], what fools we both are!"
NightAndDay	52	158787	158780	158832	Katharine	Between twelve and one that Sunday night [MASK] lay in bed, not asleep, but in that twilight region where a detached and humorous view of our own lot is possible; or if we must be serious, our seriousness is tempered by the swift oncome of slumber and oblivion.
NightAndDay	51	158905	158874	158925	Cassandra	Thus rid of any uncomfortable warmth of partisanship or load of obligation, she was dropping off to sleep when a light tap sounded upon her door. A moment later [MASK] stood beside her, holding a candle and speaking in the low tones proper to the time of night.
NightAndDay	50	159023	159005	159055	Cassandra	" "Something happened to-day which makes it impossible for me to stay here." [MASK] spoke formally, almost solemnly; the announcement was clearly prepared and marked a crisis of the utmost gravity. She continued what seemed to be part of a set speech.
NightAndDay	49	159332	159315	159364	Cassandra	"Because I can t allow any man to behave to me in that way," [MASK] replied, and she added, "particularly when I know that he is engaged to some one else." "But you like him, don t you?"
NightAndDay	58	159379	159368	159426	Cassandra	"That s got nothing to do with it," [MASK] exclaimed indignantly. "I consider his conduct, under the circumstances, most disgraceful." This was the last of the sentences of her premeditated speech; and having spoken it she was left unprovided with any more to say in that particular style.
NightAndDay	43	159462	159452	159495	Katharine	"I don t understand you in the least, [MASK]. How can you behave as you behave? Ever since I came here I ve been amazed by you!" "You ve enjoyed yourself, haven t you?"
NightAndDay	41	159725	159719	159760	William	"But do you care for [MASK]?" She marked the agitation and bewilderment of the girl s expression, and how she looked away from her. "Do you mean, am I in love with him?"
NightAndDay	44	159761	159728	159772	Cassandra	She marked the agitation and bewilderment of the girl s expression, and how she looked away from her. "Do you mean, am I in love with him?" [MASK] asked, breathing quickly, and nervously moving her hands.
NightAndDay	50	159922	159899	159949	Cassandra	"But no one knows it but ourselves." "But why I don t understand you re not engaged!" [MASK] said again. "Oh, that explains it! You re not in love with him! You don t want to marry him!"
NightAndDay	49	159964	159926	159975	Katharine	"Oh, that explains it! You re not in love with him! You don t want to marry him!" "We aren t in love with each other any longer," said [MASK], as if disposing of something for ever and ever.
NightAndDay	49	160064	160062	160111	Katharine	Nor did [MASK] speak. Her attitude was that of some one who wishes to be concealed as much as possible from observation. She sighed profoundly; she was absolutely silent, and apparently overcome by her thoughts. "D you know what time it is?"
NightAndDay	54	160129	160086	160140	Cassandra	She sighed profoundly; she was absolutely silent, and apparently overcome by her thoughts. "D you know what time it is?" she said at length, and shook her pillow, as if making ready for sleep. [MASK] rose obediently, and once more took up her candle.
NightAndDay	54	160174	160141	160195	Katharine	Perhaps the white dressing-gown, and the loosened hair, and something unseeing in the expression of the eyes gave her a likeness to a woman walking in her sleep. [MASK], at least, thought so. "There s no reason why I should go home, then?"
NightAndDay	51	160240	160211	160262	Cassandra	What _do_ you want me to do?" For the first time their eyes met. "You wanted us to fall in love," [MASK] exclaimed, as if she read the certainty there. But as she looked she saw a sight that surprised her.
NightAndDay	41	160605	160593	160634	Katharine	Don t let her suspect. Remember, nothing s certain " [MASK] assured her by nodding her head several times, but the manner in which she left the room was not calculated to inspire complete confidence in her diplomacy.
NightAndDay	58	160770	160765	160823	Katharine	She protested almost plaintively when [MASK] proposed to go upstairs. "I ve something that I want to say to you in _private_," she said, hesitating reluctantly upon the threshold of her ambush. "The drawing-room is empty " "But we might meet your mother upon the stairs.
NightAndDay	47	160974	160933	160980	Cassandra	"I see that I have interrupted you," she added, glancing at the flowers strewn upon the floor. A moment later she inquired, "Was some one sitting with you?" noticing a handkerchief that [MASK] had dropped in her flight.
NightAndDay	50	161429	161423	161473	Katharine	A slight rigidity had passed over [MASK] s face. Her lips were pressed together; her eyes were contracted, and they were still fixed upon the curtain. These superficial changes covered an extreme inner loathing such as might follow the display of some hideous or indecent spectacle.
NightAndDay	53	161809	161770	161823	Katharine	I have not wished to interfere; I have not wished to give you pain. I am a useless old woman. I have no children of my own. I only want to see you happy, [MASK]." Again she stretched forth her arms, but they remained empty.
NightAndDay	50	161916	161884	161934	Katharine	"I ve made you angry! I knew I should!" she exclaimed. She quivered, and a kind of sob shook her; but even to have made [MASK] angry was some relief, and allowed her to feel some of the agreeable sensations of martyrdom.
NightAndDay	52	162095	162078	162130	Mamma	The love of husband and wife is the most holy we know. That is the lesson [MASK] s children learnt from her; that is what they can never forget. I have tried to speak as she would have wished her daughter to speak. You are her grandchild."
NightAndDay	56	162131	162110	162166	Katharine	I have tried to speak as she would have wished her daughter to speak. You are her grandchild." [MASK] seemed to judge this defence upon its merits, and then to convict it of falsity. "I don t see that there is any excuse for your behavior," she said.
NightAndDay	53	162720	162694	162747	Katharine	"Our quarrel was perfectly hateful to me. I ve not slept all night. You re not angry with me, are you, [MASK]?" She could not bring herself to answer him until she had rid her mind of the impression that her aunt had made on her.
NightAndDay	49	162838	162810	162859	Cassandra	"What has she told you?" His air of open confidence entirely vanished. "Oh, people are saying that you re in love with [MASK], and that you don t care for me." "They have seen us?" he asked.
NightAndDay	52	162894	162850	162902	Katharine	"They have seen us?" he asked. "Everything we ve done for a fortnight has been seen." "I told you that would happen!" he exclaimed. He walked to the window in evident perturbation. [MASK] was too indignant to attend to him.
NightAndDay	42	162926	162926	162968	Rodney	[MASK] turned away from the window. "It s all been a mistake," he said. "I blame myself for it. I should have known better. I let you persuade me in a moment of madness.
NightAndDay	46	162977	162933	162979	Katharine	"It s all been a mistake," he said. "I blame myself for it. I should have known better. I let you persuade me in a moment of madness. I beg you to forget my insanity, [MASK]."
NightAndDay	46	163080	163070	163116	William	"You don t mean that this influences you, [MASK]?" she asked in amazement. "It does," he said, flushing. "It s intensely disagreeable to me. I can t endure that people should gossip about us.
NightAndDay	47	163123	163082	163129	Cassandra	" she asked in amazement. "It does," he said, flushing. "It s intensely disagreeable to me. I can t endure that people should gossip about us. And then there s your cousin [MASK] " He paused in embarrassment.
NightAndDay	54	163230	163206	163260	Rodney	No doubt her beauty, intensified by emotion and enhanced by the flowers of bright color and strange shape which she carried wrought upon [MASK], and had its share in bestowing upon her the old romance. But a less noble passion worked in him, too; he was inflamed by jealousy.
NightAndDay	42	163295	163292	163334	Katharine	And ultimately, [MASK] s dominion over him was of the sort that the fevers of the night cannot exorcise. "I was as much to blame as you were yesterday," she said gently, disregarding his question.
NightAndDay	50	163393	163393	163443	Cassandra	[MASK] dislikes me, so far as she feels about me at all. I was foolish enough to try to explain the nature of our relationship. I couldn t resist telling her what I supposed myself to feel for her. She refused to listen, very rightly.
NightAndDay	50	163456	163456	163506	Katharine	[MASK] hesitated. She was confused, agitated, physically tired, and had already to reckon with the violent feeling of dislike aroused by her aunt which still vibrated through all the rest of her feelings. She sank into a chair and dropped her flowers upon her lap.
NightAndDay	56	163513	163459	163515	Rodney	She was confused, agitated, physically tired, and had already to reckon with the violent feeling of dislike aroused by her aunt which still vibrated through all the rest of her feelings. She sank into a chair and dropped her flowers upon her lap. "She charmed me," [MASK] continued.
NightAndDay	50	163537	163523	163573	Katharine	But that s a thing of the past. It s all over, [MASK]. It was a dream an hallucination. We were both equally to blame, but no harm s done if you believe how truly I care for you. Say you believe me!"
NightAndDay	48	163777	163735	163783	Katharine	It was the moment of his triumph. It was the only moment in which she belonged to him and was dependent upon his protection. "Yes, yes, yes," he murmured, "you accept me, [MASK]. You love me."
NightAndDay	52	163907	163898	163950	Cassandra	The thrill of excitement associated with the thought of [MASK] once more took possession of him. No longer was it the excitement of anticipation and ignorance; it was the excitement of something greater than a possibility, for now he knew her and had measure of the sympathy between them.
NightAndDay	53	164029	163978	164031	Katharine	He looked at her, with doubt, and with anxiety, but said nothing. "Yes, yes," she said, interpreting his wish for assurance, "it s true. I know what she feels for you." "She loves me?" [MASK] nodded.
NightAndDay	46	164096	164052	164098	Denham	Ten minutes ago I asked you to marry me. I still wish it I don t know what I wish " He clenched his hands and turned away. He suddenly faced her and demanded: "Tell me what you feel for [MASK]."
NightAndDay	47	164135	164104	164151	William	" she asked. "Yes!" she exclaimed, as if she had found the answer to some momentarily perplexing question. "You re jealous of me, [MASK]; but you re not in love with me. I m jealous of you.
NightAndDay	50	164164	164146	164196	Cassandra	I m jealous of you. Therefore, for both our sakes, I say, speak to [MASK] at once." He tried to compose himself. He walked up and down the room; he paused at the window and surveyed the flowers strewn upon the floor.
NightAndDay	49	164297	164291	164340	Rodney	A pause succeeded this announcement. [MASK] made a step forward and said: "Then you know what I wish to ask you. Give me your answer " She put her hands before her face; she turned away and seemed to shrink from both of them.
NightAndDay	41	164343	164341	164382	Katharine	"What [MASK] said," she murmured. "But," she added, raising her head with a look of fear from the kiss with which he greeted her admission, "how frightfully difficult it all is!
NightAndDay	43	164565	164542	164585	Katharine	she exclaimed. "I can t share him even with you." "I shall never ask that," said [MASK]. She moved a little away from where they sat and began half-consciously sorting her flowers. "
NightAndDay	54	164594	164567	164621	Cassandra	She moved a little away from where they sat and began half-consciously sorting her flowers. "But you ve shared with me," [MASK] said. "Why can t I share with you? Why am I so mean? I know why it is," she added.
NightAndDay	46	164628	164597	164643	William	"Why can t I share with you? Why am I so mean? I know why it is," she added. "We understand each other, [MASK] and I. You ve never understood each other. You re too different."
NightAndDay	41	164693	164682	164723	Cassandra	Have I been very selfish?" "Yes," [MASK] interposed. "You ve asked her for sympathy, and she s not sympathetic; you ve wanted her to be practical, and she s not practical.
NightAndDay	49	164736	164696	164745	Katharine	"You ve asked her for sympathy, and she s not sympathetic; you ve wanted her to be practical, and she s not practical. You ve been selfish; you ve been exacting and so has [MASK] but it wasn t anybody s fault."
NightAndDay	42	164819	164786	164828	Cassandra	"It s quite true," she said. "It was nobody s fault." "There are many things that he ll always come to you for," [MASK] continued, still reading from her invisible book.
NightAndDay	55	165413	165370	165425	Rodney	Leaning slightly forward in his chair, and turning his little green stone, he weighed the intention of her phrases approvingly, but stopped her suddenly to complain of a noise behind him. The window was unhasped. He signed to [MASK], who crossed the room immediately to put the matter right.
NightAndDay	56	165457	165426	165482	Katharine	He stayed a moment longer by the window than was, perhaps, necessary, and having done what was needed, drew his chair a little closer than before to [MASK] s side. The music went on. Under cover of some exquisite run of melody, he leant towards her and whispered something.
NightAndDay	49	165503	165461	165510	Rodney	The music went on. Under cover of some exquisite run of melody, he leant towards her and whispered something. She glanced at her father and mother, and a moment later left the room, almost unobserved, with [MASK]. "What is it?"
NightAndDay	51	165522	165511	165562	Rodney	she asked, as soon as the door was shut. [MASK] made no answer, but led her downstairs into the dining-room on the ground floor. Even when he had shut the door he said nothing, but went straight to the window and parted the curtains.
NightAndDay	56	166158	166136	166192	Rodney	"Now," she said suddenly, with a sort of desperation, rising from her chair and seeming to command [MASK] to fulfil his part. He drew the curtain instantly, and she made no attempt to stop him. Their eyes at once sought the same spot beneath the lamp-post.
NightAndDay	52	166208	166164	166216	William	He drew the curtain instantly, and she made no attempt to stop him. Their eyes at once sought the same spot beneath the lamp-post. "He s not there!" she exclaimed. No one was there. [MASK] threw the window up and looked out.
NightAndDay	50	166311	166280	166330	Denham	With their eyes fixed upon the opposite side of the road, they did not notice a figure close to the railing which divided the garden from the street. But [MASK] had crossed the road and was standing there. They were startled by his voice close at hand.
NightAndDay	46	166393	166386	166432	Denham	Their eyes met for a second. [MASK] looked half dazed by the strong light, and, buttoned in his overcoat, with his hair ruffled across his forehead by the wind, he seemed like somebody rescued from an open boat out at sea.
NightAndDay	49	166502	166496	166545	Ralph	"Where shall I put " [MASK] began vaguely, holding out his hat and glancing about him; he balanced it carefully against a silver bowl that stood upon the sideboard. He then sat himself down rather heavily at the head of the oval dinner-table.
NightAndDay	48	166616	166616	166664	Rodney	[MASK] s expression changed. He lost his self-possession. He smiled a little nervously, and then his attention seemed to be caught by a fragment of melody from the floor above. He seemed for a moment to forget the presence of the others.
NightAndDay	51	166678	166628	166679	Denham	He smiled a little nervously, and then his attention seemed to be caught by a fragment of melody from the floor above. He seemed for a moment to forget the presence of the others. He glanced towards the door. "I congratulate you," said [MASK].
NightAndDay	45	166705	166701	166746	Katharine	"It s partly [MASK] s doing partly mine." He looked oddly round the room as if he wished to make sure that the scene in which he played a part had some real existence. "Quite mad," he repeated.
NightAndDay	42	166749	166740	166782	Katharine	Quite mad," he repeated. "Even [MASK] " His gaze rested upon her finally, as if she, too, had changed from his old view of her. He smiled at her as if to encourage her.
NightAndDay	46	166855	166849	166895	Ralph	Now that she was alone with [MASK] she felt at once that a constraint had been taken from them both. She felt that they were alone at the bottom of the house, which rose, story upon story, upon the top of them.
NightAndDay	46	167037	166997	167043	Ralph	"You re glad?" he asked. She bent her head. "Yes, yes," she sighed. "But you don t know how good he is what he s done for me " [MASK] made a sound of understanding.
NightAndDay	53	167078	167067	167120	Katharine	The words seemed to fill the room with an emotion which [MASK] connected with the sound of distant wheels, the footsteps hurrying along the pavement, the cries of sirens hooting down the river, the darkness and the wind. She saw the upright figure standing beneath the lamp-post.
NightAndDay	49	167207	167207	167256	Ralph	[MASK] looked keenly at her. Very pale, but sternly concentrated upon her meaning, beautiful but so little aware of herself as to seem remote from him also, there was something distant and abstract about her which exalted him and chilled him at the same time.
NightAndDay	49	167349	167323	167372	Ralph	She walked over to the shelf, took it down, and returned to her seat, placing the book on the table between them. [MASK] opened it and looked at the portrait of a man with a voluminous white shirt-collar, which formed the frontispiece.
NightAndDay	57	167928	167922	167979	Katharine	How should he offer it to [MASK]? He looked quickly at her. He saw that she was only half attentive to him; only a section of her was exposed to him. The sight roused in him such desperation that he had much ado to control his impulse to rise and leave the house.
NightAndDay	56	168524	168493	168549	Ralph	Because if you re in love with a vision, I believe that that s what I m in love with." This conclusion seemed fantastic and profoundly unsatisfactory to [MASK], but after the astonishing variations of his own sentiments during the past half-hour he could not accuse her of fanciful exaggeration.
NightAndDay	51	169721	169704	169755	Shakespeare	But, naturally enough, she was well provided with friends who lived in the neighborhood of [MASK] s tomb, and were delighted to welcome her; and she left later to catch her train in the best of spirits. There was a man selling violets in the street.
NightAndDay	48	169908	169907	169955	Katharine	To [MASK] it seemed as if they had brushed away sixty years or so with the first flick of their damp dusters. It seemed to her that the work she had tried to do in that room was being swept into a very insignificant heap of dust.
NightAndDay	49	169996	169969	170018	Katharine	The writing-table might have belonged to a professional man of methodical habits. Gathering together a few papers upon which she was at work, [MASK] proceeded to her own room with the intention of looking through them, perhaps, in the course of the morning.
NightAndDay	50	170404	170404	170454	Katharine	[MASK] asked, turning to the shelves again. "To tea, if that suits you?" "If it suits me to be out, I suppose you mean." "Oh, you re horrid.... Why shouldn t you ?" "Yes?"
NightAndDay	51	170472	170423	170474	Katharine	"If it suits me to be out, I suppose you mean." "Oh, you re horrid.... Why shouldn t you ?" "Yes?" "Why shouldn t you be happy too?" "I am quite happy," [MASK] replied.
NightAndDay	47	170885	170843	170890	Katharine	She called her cold, unseeing, unscrupulous, but the only sign she gave outwardly was a curious one she reached out her hand and grasped the volume of history. At that moment the bell of the telephone rang and [MASK] went to answer it.
NightAndDay	42	170891	170891	170933	Cassandra	[MASK], released from observation, dropped her book and clenched her hands. She suffered more fiery torture in those few minutes than she had suffered in the whole of her life; she learnt more of her capacities for feeling.
NightAndDay	49	170936	170905	170954	Katharine	She suffered more fiery torture in those few minutes than she had suffered in the whole of her life; she learnt more of her capacities for feeling. But when [MASK] reappeared she was calm, and had gained a look of dignity that was new to her.
NightAndDay	49	171508	171474	171523	Ralph	"I shall come." "Yes. Come to-day." "I must explain to you " "Yes. We must explain " A long pause followed. [MASK] began a sentence, which he canceled with the word, "Nothing."
NightAndDay	52	171565	171524	171576	Katharine	Suddenly, together, at the same moment, they said good-bye. And yet, if the telephone had been miraculously connected with some higher atmosphere pungent with the scent of thyme and the savor of salt, [MASK] could hardly have breathed in a keener sense of exhilaration.
NightAndDay	48	171640	171634	171682	Cassandra	She had only to look at [MASK] to see what the love that results in an engagement and marriage means. She considered for a moment, and then said: "If you don t want to tell people yourselves, I ll do it for you.
NightAndDay	47	171685	171655	171702	William	She considered for a moment, and then said: "If you don t want to tell people yourselves, I ll do it for you. I know [MASK] has feelings about these matters that make it very difficult for him to do anything."
NightAndDay	46	172709	172665	172711	William	But, in her ignorance of the way, she became panic-stricken at the thought of being late, and no sooner had she found the shop she wanted, than she fled back again in order to be at home when [MASK] came.
NightAndDay	52	172761	172740	172792	Katharine	His greeting put her doubts of his affection at rest, but the first question he asked was: "Has [MASK] spoken to you?" "Yes. But she says she s not engaged. She doesn t seem to think she s ever going to be engaged."
NightAndDay	44	172793	172767	172811	William	"Yes. But she says she s not engaged. She doesn t seem to think she s ever going to be engaged." [MASK] frowned, and looked annoyed. "They telephoned this morning, and she behaves very oddly.
NightAndDay	51	172820	172800	172851	Cassandra	"They telephoned this morning, and she behaves very oddly. She forgets to help the pudding," [MASK] added by way of cheering him. "My dear child, after what I saw and heard last night, it s not a question of guessing or suspecting.
NightAndDay	45	172870	172828	172873	Katharine	"My dear child, after what I saw and heard last night, it s not a question of guessing or suspecting. Either she s engaged to him or " He left his sentence unfinished, for at this point [MASK] herself appeared.
NightAndDay	51	172945	172921	172972	Cassandra	It was clear that he was greatly relieved. He looked round him now, as if he felt at his ease, and [MASK] exclaimed: "Don t you think everything looks quite different?" "You ve moved the sofa?" he asked. "No.
NightAndDay	54	172980	172973	173027	Katharine	Nothing s been touched," said [MASK]. "Everything s exactly the same." But as she said this, with a decision which seemed to make it imply that more than the sofa was unchanged, she held out a cup into which she had forgotten to pour any tea.
NightAndDay	56	173042	172990	173046	Cassandra	But as she said this, with a decision which seemed to make it imply that more than the sofa was unchanged, she held out a cup into which she had forgotten to pour any tea. Being told of her forgetfulness, she frowned with annoyance, and said that [MASK] was demoralizing her.
NightAndDay	53	173227	173224	173277	Katharine	In a second [MASK] was back again dressed in outdoor things, still holding her bread and butter in her bare hand. "If I m late, don t wait for me," she said. "I shall have dined," and so saying, she left them.
NightAndDay	49	173284	173278	173327	William	"But she can t " [MASK] exclaimed, as the door shut, "not without any gloves and bread and butter in her hand!" They ran to the window, and saw her walking rapidly along the street towards the City. Then she vanished.
NightAndDay	48	174557	174529	174577	Ralph	She sought in vain. The faces of the houses had now merged in the general darkness, and she had difficulty in determining which she sought. [MASK] s three windows gave back on their ghostly glass panels only a reflection of the gray and greenish sky.
NightAndDay	47	174923	174907	174954	Ralph	I want " Her wants were so vast, now that she was in communication with [MASK], that the pencil was utterly inadequate to conduct them on to the paper; it seemed as if the whole torrent of Kingsway had to run down her pencil.
NightAndDay	46	175028	174993	175039	Katharine	But, when she raised her eyes again to meditate the next sentence, she was aware of a waitress, whose expression intimated that it was closing time, and, looking round, [MASK] saw herself almost the last person left in the shop.
NightAndDay	51	175935	175929	175980	Katharine	"Yes, yes," [MASK] said, brushing these remarks aside, as if they were in the way. "Have you had tea?" "Oh yes," she said, thinking that she had had tea hundreds of years ago, somewhere or other.
NightAndDay	48	175981	175951	175999	Mary	"Have you had tea?" "Oh yes," she said, thinking that she had had tea hundreds of years ago, somewhere or other. [MASK] paused, took off her gloves, and, finding matches, proceeded to light the fire.
NightAndDay	45	176079	176071	176116	Katharine	"Oh, I remember now!" [MASK] exclaimed, with irritation at her own stupidity. "I suppose it wouldn t take twenty minutes to drive there?" She gathered up her purse and gloves and seemed about to go. "
NightAndDay	46	176126	176089	176135	Mary	"I suppose it wouldn t take twenty minutes to drive there?" She gathered up her purse and gloves and seemed about to go. "But you won t find him," said [MASK], pausing with a match in her hand.
NightAndDay	48	176136	176136	176184	Katharine	[MASK], who had already turned towards the door, stopped and looked at her. "Why? Where is he?" she asked. "He won t have left his office." "But he has left the office," she replied.
NightAndDay	49	176253	176243	176292	Katharine	"But why not telephone?" she said. [MASK] immediately dropped all that she was holding; her strained expression relaxed, and exclaiming, "Of course! Why didn t I think of that!" she seized the telephone receiver and gave her number.
NightAndDay	55	176416	176366	176421	Katharine	" "Yes, miss." "Did he ask for me?" "Yes. We said you were out, miss." "Did he leave any message?" "No. He went away. About twenty minutes ago, miss." [MASK] hung up the receiver.
NightAndDay	48	176502	176490	176538	Mary	" But the moment prolonged itself, as if for some reason [MASK] found satisfaction in making herself not only tidy, but seemly and ornamented. A stage in her life had been accomplished in the last months which left its traces for ever upon her bearing.
NightAndDay	50	176711	176711	176761	Mary	[MASK] crossed to the telephone and, after a series of brief remarks, announced: "No. His sister says he hasn t come back yet." "Ah!" She applied her ear to the telephone once more. "They ve had a message.
NightAndDay	55	176947	176906	176961	Katharine	"It would be worth your while to wait if you want to see him to-night." She bent forward and touched the wood, so that the flames slipped in between the interstices of the coal. [MASK] reflected. "I ll wait half an hour," she said.
NightAndDay	52	176962	176950	177002	Mary	"I ll wait half an hour," she said. [MASK] rose, went to the table, spread out her papers under the green-shaded lamp and, with an action that was becoming a habit, twisted a lock of hair round and round in her fingers.
NightAndDay	50	177045	177003	177053	Mary	Once she looked unperceived at her visitor, who never moved, who sat so still, with eyes so intent, that you could almost fancy that she was watching something, some face that never looked up at her. [MASK] found herself unable to go on writing.
NightAndDay	44	177070	177054	177098	Katharine	She turned her eyes away, but only to be aware of the presence of what [MASK] looked at. There were ghosts in the room, and one, strangely and sadly, was the ghost of herself. The minutes went by.
NightAndDay	47	177109	177074	177121	Katharine	There were ghosts in the room, and one, strangely and sadly, was the ghost of herself. The minutes went by. "What would be the time now?" said [MASK] at last. The half-hour was not quite spent.
NightAndDay	51	177163	177150	177201	Katharine	"Why don t you stay? Where are you going?" [MASK] looked round the room, conveying her uncertainty in her glance. "Perhaps I might find him," she mused. "But why should it matter? You ll see him another day."
NightAndDay	49	177310	177305	177354	Katharine	"No," said [MASK]. "Except that when one s desperate one has a sort of right. I am desperate. How do I know what s happening to him now? He may do anything. He may wander about the streets all night.
NightAndDay	50	177370	177326	177376	Mary	I am desperate. How do I know what s happening to him now? He may do anything. He may wander about the streets all night. Anything may happen to him." She spoke with a self-abandonment that [MASK] had never seen in her.
NightAndDay	52	177505	177487	177539	Ralph	She was baffled; she tried to think herself back again into the height of her love for [MASK]. Pressing her fingers upon her eyelids, she murmured: "You forget that I loved him too. I thought I knew him. I _did_ know him."
NightAndDay	49	177594	177548	177597	Ralph	She could not remember it any more. She pressed her eyeballs until they struck stars and suns into her darkness. She convinced herself that she was stirring among ashes. She desisted. She was astonished at her discovery. She did not love [MASK] any more.
NightAndDay	47	177711	177711	177758	Katharine	[MASK] made no reply and seemed unaware of her words. She seemed absorbed in her own thoughts. "Perhaps he s waiting in the street again to-night," she exclaimed. "I ll go now. I might find him."
NightAndDay	43	178573	178573	178616	Katharine	[MASK] submitted. "Very well," she said. "We may as well go there as anywhere else." A gloom seemed to have fallen on her. She lay back in her corner, silent and apparently exhausted.
NightAndDay	51	178617	178605	178656	Mary	She lay back in her corner, silent and apparently exhausted. [MASK], in spite of her own preoccupation, was struck by her pallor and her attitude of dejection. "I m sure we shall find him," she said more gently than she had yet spoken.
NightAndDay	44	178672	178668	178712	Mary	Without understanding her, [MASK] began to pity her for what she was suffering. "Nonsense," she said, taking her hand and rubbing it. "If we don t find him there we shall find him somewhere else."
NightAndDay	48	178800	178799	178847	Katharine	Perhaps [MASK] perceived the purpose with which her hand was held. "Don t be frightened," she said, with a little laugh. "I m not going to jump out of the cab. It wouldn t do much good after all."
NightAndDay	45	178851	178811	178856	Mary	"Don t be frightened," she said, with a little laugh. "I m not going to jump out of the cab. It wouldn t do much good after all." Upon this, [MASK] ostentatiously withdrew her hand.
NightAndDay	50	178927	178906	178956	William	It s all arranged all perfectly right.... And after he d waited in the streets for hours and hours, [MASK] made me bring him in. He was standing under the lamp-post watching our windows. He was perfectly white when he came into the room.
NightAndDay	47	178957	178934	178981	William	He was standing under the lamp-post watching our windows. He was perfectly white when he came into the room. [MASK] left us alone, and we sat and talked. It seems ages and ages ago, now. Was it last night?
NightAndDay	49	179084	179037	179086	Mary	She leant out of the window and told the cabman to drive faster. "But if he s not there, what shall I do? Where could I find him? The streets are so crowded." "We shall find him," [MASK] repeated.
NightAndDay	50	179342	179335	179385	Mary	She said nothing, and in silence [MASK] began to fix her mind, in sympathy at first, and later in forgetfulness of her companion, upon a point in front of them. She imagined a point distant as a low star upon the horizon of the dark.
NightAndDay	48	180052	180048	180096	Katharine	He had just passed [MASK] in the street and she had failed to recognize him. "That doesn t matter with me, of course, but suppose it happened with somebody else? What would they think? They would suspect something merely from her expression.
NightAndDay	55	180564	180535	180590	Ralph	This refuge was none of her willing, but confronted with wet pavements and only some belated museum or Tube station for shelter, she was forced, for [MASK] s sake, to face the discomforts of her own house. Under the street lamps she had thought him looking both tired and strained.
NightAndDay	43	180768	180754	180797	William	"Don t you think they must be ?" she began, but [MASK] hastily took her up. "Oh, I know nothing about that. I only thought we might amuse ourselves, as your uncle s out."
NightAndDay	42	181684	181664	181706	William	It is true that they go, for the most part, unthanked by name, although upon this occasion [MASK] was ready to give such discriminating praise as the dead architects and painters received seldom in the course of the year.
NightAndDay	51	182958	182929	182980	Sunday	Indeed, had they known it, he was already suffering from their absence, and longing for their return. He had no dislike of solitude, and [MASK], in particular, was pleasantly adapted for letter-writing, paying calls, or a visit to his club.
NightAndDay	41	183100	183068	183109	Katharine	She speedily made it plain that she was only thus exacting because she had come on a matter of business. He was by no means exhilarated at the news. "[MASK] is out this afternoon," he remarked.
NightAndDay	57	183699	183674	183731	Denham	"I should be inclined to doubt whether they were altogether in that walk of life," he observed. "I fancy that [MASK] once told me that his father was a corn merchant. Perhaps he said a stockbroker. He came to grief, anyhow, as stockbrokers have a way of doing.
NightAndDay	45	183778	183768	183813	Cassandra	He examined the tips of his fingers carefully. "[MASK] s grown into a very charming young woman," he started afresh. "Charming to look at, and charming to talk to, though her historical knowledge is not altogether profound.
NightAndDay	44	184033	184005	184049	Katharine	Why are they for ever meeting each other round street corners, and going to music-halls, and taking cabs late at night? Why will [MASK] not tell me the truth when I question her? I understand the reason now.
NightAndDay	56	184491	184456	184512	Katharine	She was slipping furs loosely onto the floor in the drawing-room in front of the fire. They were all gathered round, reluctant to part. The message from her father surprised [MASK], and the others caught from her look, as she turned to go, a vague sense of apprehension.
NightAndDay	47	184594	184551	184598	Rodney	Moreover, she was looking to-day unusual; he had come to take her beauty for granted; now he remembered it and was surprised by it. He thought instinctively that he had interrupted some happy hour of hers with [MASK], and apologized.
NightAndDay	55	184841	184841	184896	Cassandra	[MASK] is in our charge, and I don t intend that people should gossip about her. I suggest that you should be a little more careful in future. Invite me to your next entertainment." She did not respond, as he had hoped, with any affectionate or humorous reply.
NightAndDay	52	184911	184880	184932	Katharine	She did not respond, as he had hoped, with any affectionate or humorous reply. She meditated, pondering something or other, and he reflected that even his [MASK] did not differ from other women in the capacity to let things be. Or had she something to say?
NightAndDay	48	184990	184967	185015	William	"I ve been meaning to tell you for some time," she said, "I m not going to marry [MASK]." "You re not going !" he exclaimed, dropping the poker in his immense surprise. "Why? When?
NightAndDay	41	185019	184993	185034	Katharine	"You re not going !" he exclaimed, dropping the poker in his immense surprise. "Why? When? Explain yourself, [MASK]." "Oh, some time ago a week, perhaps more."
NightAndDay	50	185035	185022	185072	Katharine	"Oh, some time ago a week, perhaps more." [MASK] spoke hurriedly and indifferently, as if the matter could no longer concern any one. "But may I ask why have I not been told of this what do you mean by it?"
NightAndDay	50	185089	185052	185102	William	"But may I ask why have I not been told of this what do you mean by it?" "We don t wish to be married that s all." "This is [MASK] s wish as well as yours?" "Oh, yes.
NightAndDay	46	185122	185119	185165	Katharine	He thought that [MASK] was treating the matter with curious unconcern; she scarcely seemed aware of the gravity of what she was saying; he did not understand the position at all. But his desire to smooth everything over comfortably came to his relief.
NightAndDay	47	185179	185153	185200	William	But his desire to smooth everything over comfortably came to his relief. No doubt there was some quarrel, some whimsey on the part of [MASK], who, though a good fellow, was a little exacting sometimes something that a woman could put right.
NightAndDay	52	185242	185201	185253	William	But though he inclined to take the easiest view of his responsibilities, he cared too much for this daughter to let things be. "I confess I find great difficulty in following you. I should like to hear [MASK] s side of the story," he said irritably.
NightAndDay	48	185279	185254	185302	Katharine	"I think he ought to have spoken to me in the first instance." "I wouldn t let him," said [MASK]. "I know it must seem to you very strange," she added. "But I assure you, if
NightAndDay	50	185724	185682	185732	Katharine	"I can only suggest that you should postpone any decision until the effect of this misunderstanding has had time to wear off. You have now known each other " he began. "There s been no misunderstanding," [MASK] interposed. "Nothing at all."
NightAndDay	49	185764	185727	185776	William	"Nothing at all." She moved a few paces across the room, as if she intended to leave them. Her preoccupied naturalness was in strange contrast to her father s pomposity and to [MASK] s military rigidity. He had not once raised his eyes.
NightAndDay	50	185777	185769	185819	Katharine	He had not once raised his eyes. [MASK] s glance, on the other hand, ranged past the two gentlemen, along the books, over the tables, towards the door. She was paying the least possible attention, it seemed, to what was happening.
NightAndDay	50	185997	185949	185999	Rodney	I ve seen more trouble come from long engagements than from any other form of human folly. Take my advice and put the whole matter out of your minds both of you. I prescribe a complete abstinence from emotion. Visit some cheerful seaside resort, [MASK]."
NightAndDay	51	186204	186155	186206	Cassandra	But some power compelled him, as it had compelled him to come downstairs, to make his stand here and now, alone and unhelped by any one, without prospect of reward. He fumbled with various phrases; and then jerked out: "I love [MASK]."
NightAndDay	51	187322	187310	187361	Katharine	It s only marriage that s out of the question," [MASK] replied. "But if I find myself coming to want you more and more?" "If our lapses come more and more often?" He sighed impatiently, and said nothing for a moment.
NightAndDay	50	187398	187398	187448	Katharine	[MASK]," he added, his assumption of reason broken up by his agitation, "I assure you that we are in love what other people call love. Remember that night. We had no doubts whatever then. We were absolutely happy for half an hour.
NightAndDay	43	187931	187931	187974	Ralph	[MASK], at length, rose and walked gloomily to the window. He pressed close to the pane. Outside were truth and freedom and the immensity only to be apprehended by the mind in loneliness, and never communicated to another.
NightAndDay	46	188002	187975	188021	Katharine	What worse sacrilege was there than to attempt to violate what he perceived by seeking to impart it? Some movement behind him made him reflect that [MASK] had the power, if she chose, to be in person what he dreamed of her spirit.
NightAndDay	49	188336	188333	188382	Katharine	"Now, [MASK]," he said, taking up his stand in front of the fire, "you will, perhaps, have the kindness to explain " She remained silent. "What inferences do you expect me to draw?" he said sharply....
NightAndDay	55	188633	188624	188679	Katharine	After placing the most implicit trust in you, [MASK] " He broke off, disquieted by the ominous silence with which his words were received, and looked at his daughter with the curious doubt as to her state of mind which he had felt before, for the first time, this evening.
NightAndDay	57	188786	188778	188835	Katharine	"I shall come with you," [MASK] said instantly, starting forward. "You will stay here," said her father. "What are you going to say to him?" she asked. "I suppose I may say what I like in my own house?" he returned.
NightAndDay	57	189322	189322	189379	Civilization	[MASK] had been very profoundly and unpleasantly overthrown that evening; the extent of the ruin was still undetermined; he had lost his temper, a physical disaster not to be matched for the space of ten years or so; and his own condition urgently required soothing and renovating at the hands of the classics.
NightAndDay	54	189795	189790	189844	Katharine	Had he known it, [MASK] was far enough withdrawn, both physically and spiritually, from the telephone. She sat in her room with the dictionaries spreading their wide leaves on the table before her, and all the pages which they had concealed for so many years arranged in a pile.
NightAndDay	59	190038	189987	190046	Katharine	It is true that they were steps that lingered, divagated, and mounted with the deliberation natural to one past sixty whose arms, moreover, are full of leaves and blossoms; but they came on steadily, and soon a tap of laurel boughs against the door arrested [MASK] s pencil as it touched the page.
NightAndDay	53	190328	190296	190349	Katharine	I didn t want your father to tell me. I knew it from the first. I prayed that it might be so." "You knew it?" [MASK] repeated her mother s words softly and vaguely, looking past her. "How did you know it?"
NightAndDay	55	190376	190350	190405	Katharine	She began, like a child, to finger a tassel hanging from her mother s cloak. "The first evening you told me, [MASK]. Oh, and thousands of times dinner-parties talking about books the way he came into the room your voice when you spoke of him."
NightAndDay	52	190738	190688	190740	Katharine	It was plain that she had her sources of information, and, indeed, her bag was stuffed with what she called "kind letters" from the pen of her sister-in-law. "Yes. Or to stay away in the country," [MASK] concluded.
NightAndDay	50	191380	191380	191430	Katharine	[MASK] took the sheets from her mother s hand and began shuffling them absent-mindedly together, for her fixed gaze seemed to show that her thoughts were intent upon some other matter. "Well, I don t know about ugliness," she said at length.
NightAndDay	53	191480	191446	191499	Katharine	"Not that grave young man with the steady brown eyes?" "He doesn t ask anything we neither of us ask anything." "If I could help you, [MASK], by the memory of what I felt " "Yes, tell me what you felt."
NightAndDay	49	191649	191603	191652	Katharine	Your father s head looked so grand against the mast. It was life, it was death. The great sea was round us. It was the voyage for ever and ever." The ancient fairy-tale fell roundly and harmoniously upon [MASK] s ears.
NightAndDay	51	192230	192226	192277	Katharine	"Believe me, [MASK], it s the same for every one for me, too for your father," she said earnestly, and sighed. They looked together into the abyss and, as the elder of the two, she recovered herself first and asked: "
NightAndDay	59	192658	192612	192671	Katharine	He tried every device that had proved effective in the past for keeping up the partitions of the mind, until he could decently go home; but a little to his alarm he found himself assailed so persistently, as if from outside, by [MASK], that he launched forth desperately into an imaginary interview with her.
NightAndDay	57	192814	192773	192830	Katharine	Not many lines had been set down, however, before he threw away his pen as violently as if that were responsible for his misdeeds, and tore the paper into many separate pieces. This was a sign that [MASK] had asserted herself and put to him a remark that could not be met poetically.
NightAndDay	57	193471	193421	193478	Anderson	"I hope you re not disposing of somebody s fortune in a hurry," she remarked, gazing at the documents on his table, "or cutting off an entail at one blow, because I want to ask you to do me a favor. And [MASK] won t keep his horse waiting.
NightAndDay	49	193830	193830	193879	Ralph	[MASK], whose hand was grasped and whose tongue almost refused to articulate, somehow contrived to say that there were moments when he felt hopeless, utterly hopeless, though he gave no reason for this statement on his part. "But you care for her?"
NightAndDay	41	194385	194385	194426	Ralph	[MASK] was scarcely aware of what she went on to say. Her mind and body both seemed to have floated into another region of quick-sailing clouds rapidly passing across each other and enveloping everything in a vaporous indistinctness.
NightAndDay	45	194646	194619	194664	Ralph	The two men glanced at each other. If distress, shame, discomfort in its most acute form were ever visible upon a human face, [MASK] could read them all expressed beyond the eloquence of words upon the face of his unfortunate companion.
NightAndDay	56	194707	194678	194734	Shakespeare	She went on talking; she talked, it seemed to both the young men, to some one outside, up in the air. She talked about [MASK], she apostrophized the human race, she proclaimed the virtues of divine poetry, she began to recite verses which broke down in the middle.
NightAndDay	50	194931	194893	194943	Katharine	She took them to the drawing-room. The fire burnt as usual, the little tables were laid with china and silver. There was nobody there. "Ah," she said, "[MASK] s not here. She must be upstairs in her room.
NightAndDay	51	195002	194977	195028	Ralph	She had become suddenly serious and composed, mistress in her own house. The gesture with which she dismissed him had a dignity that [MASK] never forgot. She seemed to make him free with a wave of her hand to all that she possessed. He left the room.
NightAndDay	52	195058	195024	195076	Ralph	He left the room. The Hilberys house was tall, possessing many stories and passages with closed doors, all, once he had passed the drawing-room floor, unknown to [MASK]. He mounted as high as he could and knocked at the first door he came to.
NightAndDay	51	195121	195096	195147	Katharine	He was conscious of a large window, full of light, of a bare table, and of a long looking-glass. [MASK] had risen, and was standing with some white papers in her hand, which slowly fluttered to the ground as she saw her visitor.
NightAndDay	50	195382	195352	195402	Ralph	She blushed very deeply; but as she did not move or attempt to hide her face she had the appearance of some one disarmed of all defences, or [MASK] likened her to a wild bird just settling with wings trembling to fold themselves within reach of his hand.
NightAndDay	49	195469	195464	195513	Ralph	She looked to see whether [MASK] smiled, but found his gaze fixed on her with such gravity that she turned to the belief that she had committed no sacrilege but enriched herself, perhaps immeasurably, perhaps eternally. She hardly dared steep herself in the infinite bliss.
NightAndDay	50	196228	196227	196277	Cassandra	But [MASK] had her uncle s commands and anger too vividly in her mind to dare any such defiance. She became agitated and said that she must leave the house at once. She was not in a condition to go, had they known where to send her.
NightAndDay	50	196278	196278	196328	Katharine	[MASK] s common sense, which had been in abeyance for the past week or two, still failed her, and she could only ask, "But where s your luggage?" in the vague belief that to take lodgings depended entirely upon a sufficiency of luggage.
NightAndDay	43	196365	196350	196393	Ralph	"You ve lost your luggage," she repeated. Her eyes rested upon [MASK], with an expression which seemed better fitted to accompany a profound thanksgiving for his existence or some vow of eternal devotion than a question about luggage.
NightAndDay	56	196881	196863	196919	Katharine	But she pulled herself up and remarked that the kettle must have boiled completely over everything. To [MASK] s agitated mind it appeared that this kettle was an enormous kettle, capable of deluging the house in its incessant showers of steam, the enraged representative of all those household duties which she had neglected.
NightAndDay	54	197331	197303	197357	Katharine	Until I have your father s consent I have no right to speak to you let alone in this house, where my conduct" he looked at [MASK], stammered, and fell silent "where my conduct has been reprehensible and inexcusable in the extreme," he forced himself to continue.
NightAndDay	56	197691	197659	197715	Katharine	They had all regained their places; some incident of an absurd nature had now set them laughing and looking under the table, so that his entrance passed momentarily unperceived. [MASK], with flushed cheeks, raised her head and said: "Well, that s my last attempt at the dramatic."
NightAndDay	56	197870	197815	197871	Cassandra	Such is the force of habit that he could not refrain from stooping, with an absurd little thrill of pleasure at being the one to find what others were looking for, and, picking the ring up, he presented it, with a bow that was courtly in the extreme, to [MASK].
NightAndDay	59	198324	198285	198344	Katharine	He respected the young man; he was a very able young man; he was likely to get his own way. He could, he thought, looking at his still and very dignified head, understand [MASK] s preference, and, as he thought this, he was surprised by a pang of acute jealousy.
NightAndDay	49	198530	198482	198531	Denham	Had he loved her to see her swept away by this torrent, to have her taken from him by this uncontrollable force, to stand by helpless, ignored? Oh, how he loved her! How he loved her! He nodded very curtly to [MASK].
NightAndDay	53	199496	199494	199547	Mary	To see [MASK] was to risk the destruction of this globe. "Did you treat her badly?" she asked rather mechanically, walking on. "I could defend myself," he said, almost defiantly. "But what s the use, if one feels a thing?
NightAndDay	52	199579	199561	199613	Katharine	"I ll just tell her " "Of course, you must tell her," said [MASK], and now felt anxious for him to do what appeared to be necessary if he, too, were to hold his globe for a moment round, whole, and entire.
NightAndDay	45	199657	199614	199659	Ralph	"I wish I wish " she sighed, for melancholy came over her and obscured at least a section of her clear vision. The globe swam before her as if obscured by tears. "I regret nothing," said [MASK] firmly.
NightAndDay	49	199820	199813	199862	Katharine	"What are you thinking of, [MASK]?" he asked suspiciously, noticing her tone of dreaminess and the inapt words. "I was thinking of you yes, I swear it. Always of you, but you take such strange shapes in my mind.
NightAndDay	50	200394	200380	200430	Katharine	"She must be at home." He pointed across the street. [MASK] s eyes rested there too. "Is she alone, working at this time of night? What is she working at?" she wondered. "Why should we interrupt her?"
NightAndDay	49	201454	201454	201503	Katharine	[MASK] pushed the door half open and stood upon the threshold. The light lay in soft golden grains upon the deep obscurity of the hushed and sleeping household. For a moment they waited, and then loosed their hands. "Good night," he breathed.
