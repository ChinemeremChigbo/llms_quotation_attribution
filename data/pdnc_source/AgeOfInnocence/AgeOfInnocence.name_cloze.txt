AgeOfInnocence	50	4126	4102	4152	Martha	"After all," he heard one of the younger men begin behind him (everybody talked through the Mephistopheles-and-[MASK] scenes), "after all, just WHAT happened?" "Well--she left him; nobody attempts to deny that."
AgeOfInnocence	46	9323	9320	9366	Beaufort	"Ha! [MASK], this is a rare favour!" (She had an odd foreign way of addressing men by their surnames.) "Thanks. I wish it might happen oftener," said the visitor in his easy arrogant way.
AgeOfInnocence	41	9596	9590	9631	Regina	"Of course if you and [MASK] invite her the thing is settled. Well, we need new blood and new money--and I hear she's still very good-looking," the carnivorous old lady declared.
AgeOfInnocence	49	10503	10464	10513	Ouida	In an unclouded harmony of tastes and interests they cultivated ferns in Wardian cases, made macrame lace and wool embroidery on linen, collected American revolutionary glazed ware, subscribed to "Good Words," and read [MASK]'s novels for the sake of the Italian atmosphere.
AgeOfInnocence	42	10995	10988	11030	Newland	All three would be slightly embarrassed by [MASK]'s presence, now that his prospective relation to the Mingott clan had been made known; and the young man waited with an amused curiosity to see how they would turn the difficulty.
AgeOfInnocence	44	12486	12462	12506	May	A spirit of perversity moved her son to rejoin: "I don't think it was a question of taste with her. [MASK] said she meant to go, and then decided that the dress in question wasn't smart enough."
AgeOfInnocence	56	12750	12731	12787	Ellen	Why should she slink about as if it were she who had disgraced herself? She's 'poor [MASK]' certainly, because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage; but I don't see that that's a reason for hiding her head as if she were the culprit."
AgeOfInnocence	54	18530	18506	18560	Louisa	He got up, bent his long body with a stiff friendliness toward his cousin, and added: "I think I have [MASK]'s authority for saying that she will herself leave the invitation to dine when she drives out presently: with our cards--of course with our cards."
AgeOfInnocence	51	21284	21248	21299	Archer	In her dress of white and silver, with a wreath of silver blossoms in her hair, the tall girl looked like a Diana just alight from the chase. "Oh," said [MASK], "I have so many rivals; you see she's already surrounded.
AgeOfInnocence	56	21970	21958	22014	May	He had lunched with the Wellands, hoping afterward to carry off [MASK] for a walk in the Park. He wanted to have her to himself, to tell her how enchanting she had looked the night before, and how proud he was of her, and to press her to hasten their marriage.
AgeOfInnocence	52	22450	22399	22451	Sicilian	He was puzzled by the tone in which she had summoned him; he concluded that she was less simple than she seemed. The door was opened by a swarthy foreign-looking maid, with a prominent bosom under a gay neckerchief, whom he vaguely fancied to be [MASK].
AgeOfInnocence	53	24090	24056	24109	Beaufort	"This is the hour I like best--don't you?" A proper sense of his dignity caused him to answer: "I was afraid you'd forgotten the hour. [MASK] must have been very engrossing." She looked amused. "Why--have you waited long?
AgeOfInnocence	43	25873	25841	25884	Archer	She seemed to have no idea how oddly matched they were, nor what a liberty the Duke had taken in bringing his companion--and to do him justice, as [MASK] perceived, the Duke seemed as unaware of it himself.
AgeOfInnocence	48	26611	26611	26659	Archer	[MASK] was proud of the glances turned on her, and the simple joy of possessorship cleared away his underlying perplexities. "It's so delicious--waking every morning to smell lilies-of-the-valley in one's room!" she said.
AgeOfInnocence	42	27415	27375	27417	May	"Original! We're all as like each other as those dolls cut out of the same folded paper. We're like patterns stencilled on a wall. Can't you and I strike out for ourselves, [MASK]?"
AgeOfInnocence	56	28137	28086	28142	Cassandra	She glanced at the writing-table heaped with books, opened a volume of the "Contes Drolatiques," made a wry face over the archaic French, and sighed: "What learned things you read!" "Well--?" he asked, as she hovered [MASK]-like before him.
AgeOfInnocence	45	28346	28309	28354	Janey	At the last clause of this announcement a senseless anger swelled the young man's breast. To smother it he laughed. "Well, what of it? I knew she meant to." [MASK] paled and her eyes began to project.
AgeOfInnocence	46	29857	29843	29889	Louisa	"You know what these English grandees are. They're all alike. [MASK] and I are very fond of our cousin--but it's hopeless to expect people who are accustomed to the European courts to trouble themselves about our little republican distinctions.
AgeOfInnocence	54	32185	32147	32201	Archer	The only thing to do was to persuade him, as early as possible, to marry a nice girl, and then trust to her to look after him. In the complicated old European communities, [MASK] began to guess, love-problems might be less simple and less easily classified.
AgeOfInnocence	56	32955	32901	32957	Archer	"You mean the threat in her husband's letter? What weight would that carry? It's no more than the vague charge of an angry blackguard." "Yes; but it might make some unpleasant talk if he really defends the suit." "Unpleasant--!" said [MASK] explosively.
AgeOfInnocence	43	34650	34618	34661	Beaufort	He had therefore no one but himself to blame if she had opened her doors to other visitors; and he entered the drawing-room with the dogged determination to make [MASK] feel himself in the way, and to outstay him.
AgeOfInnocence	55	35525	35492	35547	Beaufort	"How delicious! May I think it over, and write to you tomorrow morning?" She spoke amiably, yet with the least hint of dismissal in her voice. [MASK] evidently felt it, and being unused to dismissals, stood staring at her with an obstinate line between his eyes.
AgeOfInnocence	42	36920	36880	36922	Archer	"Yes," she murmured at length, "that's what my family tell me." He winced a little. "It's not unnatural--" "OUR family," she corrected herself; and [MASK] coloured.
AgeOfInnocence	41	37563	37542	37583	Archer	Her remaining on her feet seemed to signify that there was nothing more for either of them to say, and [MASK] stood up also. "Very well; I will do what you wish," she said abruptly.
AgeOfInnocence	55	40755	40715	40770	Winsett	It was their old interminable argument as to the obstinate unwillingness of the "clever people" to frequent the fashionable, and both men knew that there was no use in prolonging it. "I wonder," [MASK] broke off, "how a Countess happens to live in our slum?"
AgeOfInnocence	54	40797	40771	40825	Archer	"Because she doesn't care a hang about where she lives--or about any of our little social sign-posts," said [MASK], with a secret pride in his own picture of her. "H'm--been in bigger places, I suppose," the other commented.
AgeOfInnocence	41	40950	40947	40988	Archer	He had given [MASK] to understand that his wife was an invalid; which might be true of the poor lady, or might merely mean that she was lacking in social gifts or in evening clothes, or in both.
AgeOfInnocence	52	41903	41900	41952	Archer	The next morning [MASK] scoured the town in vain for more yellow roses. In consequence of this search he arrived late at the office, perceived that his doing so made no difference whatever to any one, and was filled with sudden exasperation at the elaborate futility of his life.
AgeOfInnocence	50	43889	43844	43894	Ellen	"Shall we walk on? I'm so cold after the sermon. And what does it matter, now you're here to protect me?" The blood rose to his temples and he caught a fold of her cloak. "[MASK]--what is it?
AgeOfInnocence	47	44466	44426	44473	Archer	They were walking past the house of the old Patroon, with its squat walls and small square windows compactly grouped about a central chimney. The shutters stood wide, and through one of the newly-washed windows [MASK] caught the light of a fire.
AgeOfInnocence	51	50850	50822	50873	Janey	"She had on a black velvet polonaise with jet buttons, and a tiny green monkey muff; I never saw her so stylishly dressed," [MASK] continued. "She came alone, early on Sunday afternoon; luckily the fire was lit in the drawing-room.
AgeOfInnocence	50	50901	50853	50903	Newland	"She came alone, early on Sunday afternoon; luckily the fire was lit in the drawing-room. She had one of those new card-cases. She said she wanted to know us because you'd been so good to her." [MASK] laughed.
AgeOfInnocence	46	53576	53549	53595	Ellen	"I shall see you later, dear friend?" he suggested to the Marchioness, who replied with a smile: "As soon as [MASK]'s carriage comes I will join you; I do hope the lecture won't have begun."
AgeOfInnocence	47	55724	55700	55747	Archer	She sat motionless, holding her cigarette in her half-lifted hand. The expression of her face had not changed; and [MASK] remembered that he had before noticed her apparent incapacity for surprise. "You knew, then?" he broke out.
AgeOfInnocence	51	55780	55748	55799	Medora	She was silent for so long that the ash dropped from her cigarette. She brushed it to the floor. "She has hinted about a letter: poor darling! [MASK]'s hints--" "Is it at your husband's request that she has arrived here suddenly?"
AgeOfInnocence	41	56485	56481	56522	Archer	Down the quiet street [MASK] heard the approaching trot of her horses. "That IS noble," she said, with a slight break in her voice. "Yes. But it's ridiculous." "Ridiculous?
AgeOfInnocence	53	56593	56547	56600	May	"Ah." There was another long interval. At length she looked up at him and asked: "This other woman--does she love you?" "Oh, there's no other woman; I mean, the person that [MASK] was thinking of is--was never--
AgeOfInnocence	56	56709	56676	56732	Archer	" "Yes." She smiled and added: "I must go where I am invited, or I should be too lonely. Why not come with me?" [MASK] felt that at any cost he must keep her beside him, must make her give him the rest of her evening.
AgeOfInnocence	53	57705	57656	57709	May	He stood up too, flushed and resolute. "Nonsense! It's too late for that sort of thing. We've no right to lie to other people or to ourselves. We won't talk of your marriage; but do you see me marrying [MASK] after this?"
AgeOfInnocence	41	58657	58643	58684	May	He reddened under the retort, but kept his eyes on her. "[MASK] is ready to give me up." "What! Three days after you've entreated her on your knees to hasten your marriage?"
AgeOfInnocence	47	59064	59044	59091	Archer	Am too happy for words and love you dearly. Your grateful May." Half an hour later, when [MASK] unlocked his own front-door, he found a similar envelope on the hall-table on top of his pile of notes and letters.
AgeOfInnocence	43	59449	59426	59469	Mamma	I'm so glad! But, dearest, why do you keep on laughing? Do hush, or you'll wake [MASK]." Book II XIX. The day was fresh, with a lively spring wind full of dust.
AgeOfInnocence	49	60027	60025	60074	Handel	Overhead, [MASK]'s March swelled pompously through the imitation stone vaulting, carrying on its waves the faded drift of the many weddings at which, with cheerful indifference, he had stood on the same chancel step watching other brides float up the nave toward other bridegrooms.
AgeOfInnocence	55	60626	60606	60661	Archer	"I should as soon turn the reporters loose in my house." Yet there was a time when [MASK] had had definite and rather aggressive opinions on all such problems, and when everything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had seemed to him fraught with world-wide significance.
AgeOfInnocence	50	61823	61817	61867	May	Then, in a moment, [MASK] was beside him, such radiance streaming from her that it sent a faint warmth through his numbness, and he straightened himself and smiled into her eyes. "Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here," the Rector began ...
AgeOfInnocence	53	63637	63585	63638	XX	"Well--that's what we're going to be, isn't it?" cried her husband gaily; and she answered with her boyish smile: "Ah, it's just our luck beginning--the wonderful luck we're always going to have together!" [MASK].
AgeOfInnocence	49	64560	64536	64585	Newland	He tried to enter into her perplexity. "But don't Englishwomen dress just like everybody else in the evening?" "[MASK]! How can you ask such funny questions? When they go to the theatre in old ball-dresses and bare heads."
AgeOfInnocence	55	64660	64611	64666	Janey	They'll wear caps like my mother's--and shawls; very soft shawls." "Yes; but how will the other women be dressed?" "Not as well as you, dear," he rejoined, wondering what had suddenly developed in her [MASK]'s morbid interest in clothes.
AgeOfInnocence	53	65216	65187	65240	May	There was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free; and he had long since discovered that [MASK]'s only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be to lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration.
AgeOfInnocence	49	65990	65968	66017	Pocahontas	"I don't want them to think that we dress like savages," she replied, with a scorn that [MASK] might have resented; and he was struck again by the religious reverence of even the most unworldly American women for the social advantages of dress.
AgeOfInnocence	41	67481	67481	67522	May	[MASK] roused herself from one of the dreamy silences into which he had read so many meanings before six months of marriage had given him the key to them. "The little Frenchman? Wasn't he dreadfully common?"
AgeOfInnocence	47	69754	69722	69769	Ellen	A contrast indeed to this gay scene of worldly pleasure--but then I have always lived on contrasts! To me the only death is monotony. I always say to [MASK]: Beware of monotony; it's the mother of all the deadly sins.
AgeOfInnocence	43	71451	71419	71462	May	"Quite an heirloom, in fact, my dear," the old lady chuckled. "You must leave it in fee to your eldest girl." She pinched [MASK]'s white arm and watched the colour flood her face.
AgeOfInnocence	57	74274	74250	74307	May	"Oh, I think for a change I'll just save it instead of spending it--" and once, when she and [MASK] had had to go on a long-postponed round of afternoon calls, he had confessed to having lain all the afternoon under a rock on the beach below the house.
AgeOfInnocence	43	77459	77447	77490	Archer	"I'm here on business--just got here," [MASK] explained; and, without knowing why, he suddenly began to feign astonishment at seeing her. "But what on earth are you doing in this wilderness?"
AgeOfInnocence	54	80947	80901	80955	Beaufort	he asked abruptly. "I haven't seen him for a long time. But I used to; and he understands." "Ah, it's what I've always told you; you don't like us. And you like [MASK] because he's so unlike us."
AgeOfInnocence	41	83972	83972	84013	Archer	[MASK] had known for the last few minutes that the words were coming; but when they came they sent the blood rushing to his temples as if he had been caught by a bent-back branch in a thicket.
AgeOfInnocence	47	84607	84568	84615	Archer	"Monsieur--will you tell me one thing? Is it my right to be here that you question? Or do you perhaps believe the whole matter to be already closed?" His quiet insistence made [MASK] feel the clumsiness of his own bluster.
AgeOfInnocence	53	85086	85080	85133	Monsieur	"Don't you know, [MASK]--is it possible you don't know--that the family begin to doubt if they have the right to advise the Countess to refuse her husband's last proposals?" "The proposals you brought?" "The proposals I brought."
AgeOfInnocence	55	85218	85189	85244	Monsieur	"What is your object in speaking to me of this?" He had not to wait a moment for the answer. "To beg you, [MASK]--to beg you with all the force I'm capable of--not to let her go back.--Oh, don't let her!"
AgeOfInnocence	50	85419	85413	85463	Archer	"Well, then--?" [MASK] paused again, and their eyes met in another protracted scrutiny. "Ah, Monsieur, after I had seen her, after I had listened to her, I knew she was better off here." "You knew--?"
AgeOfInnocence	43	86691	86691	86734	Archer	[MASK] had been wont to smile at these annual vaticinations of his mother's; but this year even he was obliged to acknowledge, as he listened to an enumeration of the changes, that the "trend" was visible.
AgeOfInnocence	49	88317	88309	88358	Regina	He hasn't spent all his money on [MASK]." "Oh, well--that's discounted, isn't it? My belief is he'll pull out yet," said the young man, wanting to change the subject. "Perhaps--perhaps.
AgeOfInnocence	48	88859	88830	88878	Archer	"Well--to put it on the lowest ground--what's she going to live on now?" "Now--?" "If Beaufort--" [MASK] sprang up, his fist banging down on the black walnut-edge of the writing-table.
AgeOfInnocence	51	89149	89108	89159	Archer	"Ah--DID he?" snapped the other, as if this were exactly the fact he had been laying a trap for. He still sat sideways from the fire, so that his hard old gaze held [MASK]'s face as if in a spring of steel.
AgeOfInnocence	46	92808	92803	92849	Ellen	If it goes at once [MASK] can probably catch tomorrow morning's train." She pronounced the syllables of the name with a peculiar clearness, as if she had tapped on two silver bells. "Well, it can't go at once.
AgeOfInnocence	46	92850	92818	92864	Jasper	She pronounced the syllables of the name with a peculiar clearness, as if she had tapped on two silver bells. "Well, it can't go at once. [MASK] and the pantry-boy are both out with notes and telegrams."
AgeOfInnocence	45	95187	95157	95202	May	"Shall I fetch her?" he proposed. "I can easily get away from the office in time to meet the brougham at the ferry, if [MASK] will send it there." His heart was beating excitedly as he spoke.
AgeOfInnocence	53	95569	95559	95612	May	It did not hurt him half as much to tell [MASK] an untruth as to see her trying to pretend that she had not detected him. "I'm not going till later on: luckily for the convenience of your family," he continued, taking base refuge in sarcasm.
AgeOfInnocence	48	96911	96869	96917	Riviere	As on certain other occasions when he had expected to shake her out of her usual composure, she betrayed no sign of surprise: and at once he concluded: "He writes to her, then." "M. [MASK] went to see you?"
AgeOfInnocence	47	97011	96984	97031	Riviere	"Yes." "I wanted to ask it after I saw him, but I couldn't put it in a letter. It was [MASK] who helped you to get away--when you left your husband?" His heart was beating suffocatingly.
AgeOfInnocence	54	97076	97026	97080	Archer	His heart was beating suffocatingly. Would she meet this question with the same composure? "Yes: I owe him a great debt," she answered, without the least tremor in her quiet voice. Her tone was so natural, so almost indifferent, that [MASK]'s turmoil subsided.
AgeOfInnocence	51	99003	98960	99011	Granny's	There's nothing wrong?" "Only some letters I'd forgotten, and wanted to get off before dinner." "Ah--" she said; and a moment afterward: "I'm sorry you didn't come to [MASK]--unless the letters were urgent."
AgeOfInnocence	53	99432	99423	99476	May	He had taken to history in the evenings since [MASK] had shown a tendency to ask him to read aloud whenever she saw him with a volume of poetry: not that he disliked the sound of his own voice, but because he could always foresee her comments on what he read.
AgeOfInnocence	50	100537	100528	100578	Archer	There was a moment's pause, and then [MASK] felt it incumbent on him to say: "All right. Shall we go together this afternoon?" His wife's face brightened, but she instantly answered: "Oh, you'd much better go alone.
AgeOfInnocence	44	101114	101106	101150	Ellen	"Ah, but not as handsome as [MASK]!" she jerked out, twinkling at him maliciously; and before he could answer she added: "Was she so awfully handsome the day you drove her up from the ferry?"
AgeOfInnocence	42	102470	102470	102512	Archer	[MASK] bent down and pressed his lips on the little hand that still lay on his. "Eh--eh--eh! Whose hand did you think you were kissing, young man--your wife's, I hope?
AgeOfInnocence	44	102540	102513	102557	Granny	" the old lady snapped out with her mocking cackle; and as he rose to go she called out after him: "Give her her [MASK]'s love; but you'd better not say anything about our talk." XXXI.
AgeOfInnocence	50	105464	105447	105497	Granny	"What do you think better?" Instead of answering she murmured: "I promised [MASK] to stay with her because it seemed to me that here I should be safer." "From me?" She bent her head slightly, without looking at him.
AgeOfInnocence	47	106690	106673	106720	Archer	I'm afraid I haven't been fair to her lately. I've sometimes thought--" [MASK] stood up and leaned against the mantelpiece, out of the radius of the lamp. "Yes, you've thought--?" he echoed as she paused.
AgeOfInnocence	55	106878	106850	106905	Ellen	He became aware of the same obscure effort in her, the same reaching out toward something beyond the usual range of her vision. "She hates [MASK]," he thought, "and she's trying to overcome the feeling, and to get me to help her to overcome it."
AgeOfInnocence	49	107951	107919	107968	Morny	," he repeated, seeing the eyes of the company expectantly turned on him, "the standard was excessively lax in some respects; and if you'd asked where [MASK]'s money came from--! Or who paid the debts of some of the Court beauties ...
AgeOfInnocence	52	110156	110113	110165	Archer	He could not find his voice, and she went out of the room, and came back almost immediately. "I thought you knew," she said simply. She laid a sheet of paper on the table, and [MASK] put out his hand and took it up.
AgeOfInnocence	42	110183	110166	110208	Granny	The letter contained only a few lines. "May dear, I have at last made [MASK] understand that my visit to her could be no more than a visit; and she has been as kind and generous as ever.
AgeOfInnocence	44	110303	110278	110322	Archer	"If any of my friends wish to urge me to change my mind, please tell them it would be utterly useless." [MASK] read the letter over two or three times; then he flung it down and burst out laughing.
AgeOfInnocence	53	112081	112035	112088	Archer	"I don't say it's conclusive, you observe; far from it. But straws show ... and on the whole it's eminently satisfactory for all parties that this dignified solution has been reached." "Oh, eminently," [MASK] assented, pushing back the paper.
AgeOfInnocence	47	112539	112530	112577	Archer	She paused, embarrassed and yet smiling, and [MASK] suddenly saw before him the embodied image of the Family. "Oh, all right," he said, staring with unseeing eyes at the list of guests that she had put in his hand.
AgeOfInnocence	57	112587	112551	112608	May	"Oh, all right," he said, staring with unseeing eyes at the list of guests that she had put in his hand. When he entered the drawing-room before dinner [MASK] was stooping over the fire and trying to coax the logs to burn in their unaccustomed setting of immaculate tiles.
AgeOfInnocence	55	115254	115214	115269	May	He understood that in a moment she would be gone, and tried to remember what he had said to her at dinner; but he could not recall a single word they had exchanged. She went up to [MASK], the rest of the company making a circle about her as she advanced.
AgeOfInnocence	47	116271	116233	116280	May	"Oh, my dear," he said, holding her to him while his cold hand stroked her hair. There was a long pause, which the inner devils filled with strident laughter; then [MASK] freed herself from his arms and stood up.
AgeOfInnocence	49	116339	116295	116344	Mamma	That is, of course I hoped--" They looked at each other for an instant and again fell silent; then, turning his eyes from hers, he asked abruptly: "Have you told any one else?" "Only [MASK] and your mother."
AgeOfInnocence	45	116366	116345	116390	Ellen	She paused, and then added hurriedly, the blood flushing up to her forehead: "That is--and [MASK]. You know I told you we'd had a long talk one afternoon--and how dear she was to me."
AgeOfInnocence	42	118291	118272	118314	Mary	And the difference seemed symbolic; the mother's life had been as closely girt as her figure. [MASK], who was no less conventional, and no more intelligent, yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views.
AgeOfInnocence	49	121003	120973	121022	Archer	"Well, the woman you'd have chucked everything for: only you didn't," continued his surprising son. "I didn't," echoed [MASK] with a kind of solemnity. "No: you date, you see, dear old boy.
AgeOfInnocence	43	122366	122330	122373	Dallas	The day was fading into a soft sun-shot haze, pricked here and there by a yellow electric light, and passers were rare in the little square into which they had turned. [MASK] stopped again, and looked up.
AgeOfInnocence	49	122524	122514	122563	Archer	It must be the one with the awnings." [MASK] remained motionless, gazing at the upper windows as if the end of their pilgrimage had been attained. "I say, you know, it's nearly six," his son at length reminded him.
AgeOfInnocence	43	122685	122661	122704	Dallas	"If you don't she won't understand." "Go, my boy; perhaps I shall follow you." [MASK] gave him a long look through the twilight. "But what on earth shall I say?"
AgeOfInnocence	56	122796	122796	122852	Archer	[MASK] sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged balcony. He calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up in the lift to the fifth floor, to ring the bell, and be admitted to the hall, and then ushered into the drawing-room.
