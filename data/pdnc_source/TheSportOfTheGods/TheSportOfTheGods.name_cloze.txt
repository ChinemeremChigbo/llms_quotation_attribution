TheSportOfTheGods	51	652	636	687	Joe	She was a pretty, cheery little thing, and could sing like a lark. [MASK] too was of a cheerful disposition, but from scraping the chins of aristocrats came to imbibe some of their ideas, and rather too early in life bid fair to be a dandy.
TheSportOfTheGods	55	905	861	916	Benjamin	The girl did have the prettiest clothes of any of her race in the town, and when she was to sing for the benefit of the A. M. E. church or for the benefit of her father's society, the Tribe of [MASK], there was nothing too good for her to wear.
TheSportOfTheGods	45	1767	1766	1811	Francis	For [MASK] was a great favourite both with men and women. He was a handsome man, tall, slender, and graceful. He had the face and brow of a poet, a pallid face framed in a mass of dark hair.
TheSportOfTheGods	59	2596	2542	2601	Francis	"Yes, a man is always doing something, even if only waiting; but waiting is such unheroic business." "That is the part that usually falls to a woman's lot. I have no doubt that some dark-eyed mademoiselle is waiting for you now." [MASK] laughed and flushed hotly.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	2833	2793	2843	Frank	"Hear!" cried the ladies. "Trust artists and poets to pay pretty compliments, and this wily friend of mine pays his at my expense." "A good bit of generalship, that, [MASK]," an old military man broke in. "
TheSportOfTheGods	49	2864	2855	2904	Claire	That 's the highest art of war." [MASK] was looking at her companion. Had he meant the approval of the women, or was it one woman that he cared for? Had the speech had a hidden meaning for her? She could never tell.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	3062	3030	3082	Maurice	When he came down it was not to come directly to the dining-room. He paused in the hall and despatched a servant to bring his brother to him. [MASK] found him standing weakly against the railing of the stairs. Something in his air impressed his brother strangely.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	3088	3083	3134	Francis	"What is it, [MASK]?" he questioned, hurrying to him. "I have just discovered a considerable loss," was the reply in a grieved voice. "If it is no worse than loss, I am glad; but what is it?"
TheSportOfTheGods	53	3248	3239	3292	Frank	Don't look so cut up about it, [MASK], old man. It is n't as bad as it might be, and you must n't show a gloomy face to-night." The younger man pulled himself together, and re-entered the room with his brother.
TheSportOfTheGods	42	3361	3328	3370	Leslie	His face did not change until, with a wealth of fervent congratulations, he had bade the last guest good-bye. Then he turned to his brother. "When [MASK] is in bed, come into the library.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	3449	3428	3477	Frank	He sat limply in his chair, his eyes fixed upon the floor. "Come, brace up now, [MASK], and tell me about it." At the sound of his brother's voice he started and looked up as though he had been dreaming.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	3490	3458	3508	Maurice	At the sound of his brother's voice he started and looked up as though he had been dreaming. "I don't know what you 'll think of me, [MASK]," he said; "I have never before been guilty of such criminal carelessness."
TheSportOfTheGods	49	3693	3683	3732	Frank	"You have no right to talk that way, [MASK]; you know I do not begrudge a cent you want. I have never felt that my father did quite right in leaving me the bulk of the fortune; but we won't discuss that now.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	3771	3733	3785	Maurice	What I want you to understand, though, is that the money is yours as well as mine, and you are always welcome to it." The artist shook his head. "No, [MASK]," he said, "I can accept no more from you.
TheSportOfTheGods	55	3891	3891	3946	Leslie	[MASK] and I have perfect faith in you. You shall not give up on account of this misfortune. What are the few paltry dollars to me or to you?" "Nothing, nothing, I know. It is n't the money, it 's the principle of the thing."
TheSportOfTheGods	47	3989	3978	4025	Frank	The younger man looked up quickly. "Pardon me, [MASK], for using those words and at such a time. You know how near my heart your success lies, and to hear you talk of giving it all up makes me forget myself.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	4110	4110	4162	Frank	[MASK] gave a scarcely perceptible start. "I do so hate such things," he said; "and, anyway, what 's the use? They 'll never find out where the stuff went to." "Oh, you need not be troubled in this matter.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	4245	4221	4273	Esterton	"Never mind that. Now tell me, who was the last person you remember in your room?" "Oh, [MASK] was up there awhile before dinner. But he was not alone two minutes." "Why, he would be out of the question anyway.
TheSportOfTheGods	42	4279	4253	4295	Hamilton	But he was not alone two minutes." "Why, he would be out of the question anyway. Who else?" "[MASK] was up yesterday." "Alone?" "Yes, for a while.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	4508	4475	4523	Hamilton	The negroes are becoming less faithful and less contented, and more 's the pity, and a deal more ambitious, although I have never had any unfaithfulness on the part of [MASK] to complain of before." "Then do not condemn him now."
TheSportOfTheGods	46	4596	4589	4635	Hamilton	But as soon as a negro like [MASK] learns the value of money and begins to earn it, at the same time he begins to covet some easy and rapid way of securing it. The old negro knew nothing of the value of money.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	4693	4670	4721	Frank	The present negro resents the laugh, and he has learned to value other things than those which satisfy his belly." [MASK] looked bored. "But pardon me for boring you. I know you want to go to bed. Go and leave everything to me."
TheSportOfTheGods	43	4729	4697	4740	Maurice	"But pardon me for boring you. I know you want to go to bed. Go and leave everything to me." The young man reluctantly withdrew, and [MASK] went to the telephone and rung up the police station.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	4841	4841	4890	Oakley	[MASK] protested, but the detective was adamant. Even now the presence in the room of a man uninitiated into the mysteries of criminal methods might be destroying the last vestige of a really important clue. The master of the house had no alternative save to yield.
TheSportOfTheGods	47	5222	5222	5269	Maurice	[MASK] answered grimly, "My butler's cottage is on that side and a little way back." "Uh huh! and your butler is, I believe, the Hamilton whom the young gentleman mentioned some time ago." "Yes."
TheSportOfTheGods	50	5270	5246	5296	Frank	and your butler is, I believe, the Hamilton whom the young gentleman mentioned some time ago." "Yes." [MASK]'s face was really very white now. The detective nodded again. "I think I have a clue," he said simply.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	5318	5279	5329	Frank	The detective nodded again. "I think I have a clue," he said simply. "I will be here again to-morrow morning." "But I shall be gone," said [MASK]. "You will hardly be needed, anyway."
TheSportOfTheGods	49	5376	5347	5396	Frank	He went as far as the outer door with his brother and the detective. As he bade the officer good-night and hurried up the hall, [MASK] put his hand to his head again with a convulsive gesture, as if struck by a sudden pain.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	5461	5440	5489	Maurice	But we 've got to face it like men." They passed into the dining-room, where [MASK] poured out some brandy for his brother and himself. "Who would have thought it?" he asked, as he tossed his own down.
TheSportOfTheGods	59	5579	5531	5590	Maurice	I should feel the sting of all this much less if the thief had come from the outside, broken in, and robbed me, but this, after all these years, is too low." "Don't be hard on a man, [MASK]; one never knows what prompts him to a deed.
TheSportOfTheGods	43	5615	5591	5634	Frank	And this evidence is all circumstantial." "It is plain enough for me. You are entirely too kind-hearted, [MASK]. But I see that this thing has worn you out. You must not stand here talking.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	5790	5763	5815	Hamilton	She was horror-struck. It was hard to have to believe this awful thing of an old servant, but she agreed with him that [MASK] must be made an example of when the time came. Before that, however, he must not know that he was suspected.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	5853	5816	5864	Hamilton	They fell asleep, he with thoughts of anger and revenge, and she grieved and disappointed. IV FROM A CLEAR SKY The inmates of the Oakley house had not been long in their beds before [MASK] was out of his and rousing his own little household.
TheSportOfTheGods	56	5906	5888	5944	Kitty	You got to he'p me befo' you go to any shop dis mo'nin'. You, [MASK], stir yo' stumps, miss. I know yo' ma 's a-dressin' now. Ef she ain't, I bet I 'll be aftah huh in a minute, too.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	6047	6006	6052	Berry	The blue smoke from the "house," where the fire was already going, whirled fantastically over the roofs like a belated ghost. It was just the morning to doze in comfort, and so thought all of [MASK]'s household except himself.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	6436	6397	6447	Berry	He did not even take the trouble to inquire who the strange white man was who hung about the place. When it came time for the young man to leave, with the privilege of an old servitor [MASK] went up to him to bid him good-bye.
TheSportOfTheGods	44	6614	6602	6646	Maurice	"Promise me you won't be too hard on him, [MASK]. Give him a little scare and let him go. He 's possibly buried the money, anyhow." "I shall deal with him as he deserves."
TheSportOfTheGods	50	6675	6660	6710	Maurice	"Whether I fail or succeed, you will always think well of me, [MASK]?" he said in parting; "and if I don't come up to your expectations, well--forgive me--that 's all." His brother wrung his hand.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	6721	6678	6726	Frank	he said in parting; "and if I don't come up to your expectations, well--forgive me--that 's all." His brother wrung his hand. "You will always come up to my expectations, [MASK]," he said.
TheSportOfTheGods	45	6913	6906	6951	Oakley	They went immediately to the library, [MASK] walking with the firm, hard tread of a man who is both exasperated and determined, and the officer gliding along with the cat-like step which is one of the attributes of his profession.
TheSportOfTheGods	53	7104	7073	7126	Berry	"You know that he has money in the bank?" "No." "Well, he has. Over eight hundred dollars." "What? [MASK]? It must be the pickings of years." "And yesterday it was increased by five hundred more."
TheSportOfTheGods	49	7159	7158	7207	Berry	"[MASK]'s money was almost all in bills of a small denomination and silver." "A poor trick; it could easily have been changed." "Not such a sum without exciting comment." "He may have gone to several places."
TheSportOfTheGods	51	7544	7543	7594	Berry	"[MASK]," the officer pursued, "you admit having deposited five hundred dollars in the bank yesterday?" "Sut'ny. Dey ain't no reason why I should n't admit it, 'ceptin' erroun' ermong dese jealous niggahs." "Uh huh!
TheSportOfTheGods	51	7752	7726	7777	Fannie	"Why, mos'ly it was too small, an' so I des' kep' it in a ol' sock. I tol' [MASK] dat some day ef de bank did n't bus' wid all de res' I had, I 'd put it in too.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	7859	7830	7878	Oakley	But fin'lly I listened to huh an' sposited it yistiddy." "You 're a liar! you 're a liar, you black thief!" [MASK] broke in impetuously. "You have learned your lesson well, but you can't cheat me.
TheSportOfTheGods	41	7921	7899	7940	Berry	"I will not calm myself. Take him away. He shall not stand here and lie to me." [MASK] had suddenly turned ashen. "You say you know whaih dat money come f'om? Whaih?"
TheSportOfTheGods	53	8053	8018	8071	Oakley	She 'll know how long I been a-savin' dis money." "I 'll ask no one." "I think it would be better to call his wife, [MASK]." "Well, call her, but let this matter be done with soon."
TheSportOfTheGods	58	8072	8056	8114	Fannie	"Well, call her, but let this matter be done with soon." [MASK] was summoned, and when the matter was explained to her, first gave evidences of giving way to grief, but when the detective began to question her, she calmed herself and answered directly just as her husband had.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	8186	8152	8198	Fannie	At the word "arrest" his wife collapsed utterly, and sobbed on her husband's shoulder. "Send the woman away." "I won't go," cried [MASK] stoutly; "I 'll stay right hyeah by my husband.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	8208	8208	8258	Berry	[MASK] turned to his employer. "You b'lieve dat I stole f'om dis house aftah all de yeahs I 've been in it, aftah de caih I took of yo' money an' yo' valybles, aftah de way I 've put you to bed
TheSportOfTheGods	41	8352	8329	8370	Oakley	damn you! ef dat 's all dese yeahs counted fu', I wish I had a-stoled it." [MASK] made a step forward, and his man did likewise, but the officer stepped between them.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	8417	8383	8432	Fannie	I 'll do him violence!" The two men stood fiercely facing each other, then the handcuffs were snapped on the servant's wrist. "No, no," shrieked [MASK], "you must n't, you must n't. Oh, my Gawd!
TheSportOfTheGods	48	8667	8621	8669	Berry	Hit 's boun' to come out all right." She raised her head, and seizing his manacled hands pressed them to her breast, wailing in a low monotone, "Gone! gone!" They disengaged her hands, and led [MASK] away.
TheSportOfTheGods	57	9945	9943	10000	Berry	I know [MASK], and I 've known him for a long while, and a politer, likelier darky than him you would have to go far to find. And I have n't the least doubt in the world that he took that money absolutely without a thought of wrong, sir, absolutely.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	10171	10139	10187	Dodson	It 's simply total depravity, that 's all. All niggers are alike, and there 's no use trying to do anything with them. Look at that man, [MASK], of mine. I had one of the finest young hounds in the State.
TheSportOfTheGods	55	10277	10229	10284	Jove	At night I put him in that nigger's care to feed and bed. Well, do you know, I came home the other night and found that black rascal gone? I went out to see if the dog was properly bedded, and by [MASK], the dog was gone too.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	10336	10323	10372	Dodson	So I stayed outside and watched. In about an hour here came [MASK] with a possum hung over his shoulder and my dog trottin' at his heels. He 'd been possum huntin' with my hound--with the finest hound in the State, sir.
TheSportOfTheGods	42	10401	10373	10415	Beachfield	Now, I appeal to you all, gentlemen, if that ain't total depravity, what is total depravity?" "Not total depravity, [MASK], I maintain, but the very irresponsibility of which I have spoken.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	10554	10543	10593	Colonel	"Why, there can be no doubt. Why, [MASK], what are you thinking of? Tell us who has got the money if he has n't? Tell us where on earth the nigger got the money he 's been putting in the bank? Doubt?
TheSportOfTheGods	45	10699	10663	10708	Berry	This man makes only thirty dollars a month. Don't you see?" The Colonel saw, or said he did. And he did not answer what he might have answered, that [MASK] had no rent and no board to pay.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	10916	10892	10940	Fannie	Then he would toss and moan and give vent to his sorrow in passionate complaints. "I did n't tech his money, [MASK], you know I did n't. I wo'ked fu' every cent of dat money, an' I saved it myself.
TheSportOfTheGods	55	11046	10995	11050	Fannie	That he would be convicted and sentenced was as far from possibility as the skies from the earth. If he saw visions of a long sojourn in prison, it was only as a nightmare half consciously experienced and which with the struggle must give way before the waking. [MASK] was utterly hopeless.
TheSportOfTheGods	47	11177	11156	11203	Fannie	"Oh, I did n't say dat; I did n't mean dat." "That will do, [MASK]. I understand perfectly. You should have confessed that long ago." "But I ain't confessin'! I ain't!
TheSportOfTheGods	48	11403	11381	11429	Kit	The looks and gibes of his fellow-employees at the barber-shop forced him to leave his work there. [MASK], bowed with shame and grief, dared not appear upon the streets, where the girls who had envied her now hooted at her.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	11445	11430	11479	Joe	So the little family was shut in upon itself away from fellowship and sympathy. [MASK] went seldom to see his father. He was not heartless; but the citadel of his long desired and much vaunted manhood trembled before the sight of his father's abject misery.
TheSportOfTheGods	53	11533	11497	11550	Berry	Poor fellow, he was too young for this forcing process, and in the hot-house of pain he only grew an acrid, unripe cynic. At the sitting of the Grand Jury [MASK] was indicted. His trial followed soon, and the town turned out to see it.
TheSportOfTheGods	56	11654	11628	11684	Nature	He was given ten years at hard labour. He hardly looked as if he could live out one as he heard his sentence. But [MASK] was kind and relieved him of the strain. With a cry as if his heart were bursting, he started up and fell forward on his face unconscious.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	11756	11745	11794	Fannie	As soon as the trial was over, he sent for [MASK], who still kept the cottage in the yard. "You must go," he said. "You can't stay here any longer. I want none of your breed about me."
TheSportOfTheGods	46	11796	11785	11831	Fannie	I want none of your breed about me." And [MASK] bowed her head and went away from him in silence. All the night long the women of the Hamilton household lay in bed and wept, clinging to each other in their grief.
TheSportOfTheGods	57	11833	11808	11865	Joe	All the night long the women of the Hamilton household lay in bed and wept, clinging to each other in their grief. But [MASK] did not go to sleep. Against all their entreaties, he stayed up. He put out the light and sat staring into the gloom with hard, burning eyes.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	11922	11888	11936	Oakley	He reiterated it to the very moment that the train which was bearing him away pulled out of the station. There had seldom been seen such an example of criminal hardihood, and [MASK] was hardened thereby to greater severity in dealing with the convict's wife.
TheSportOfTheGods	57	12152	12138	12195	Oakley	In all their lives they had known no home save the little cottage in [MASK]'s yard. Here they had toddled as babies and played as children and been happy and care-free. There had been times when they had complained and wanted a home off by themselves, like others whom they knew.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	12290	12276	12324	Kit	"I 'll go an' see what I kin do, anyway, [MASK]. 'T ain't much use, I reckon, trying to get into a bahbah shop where they shave white folks, because all the white folks are down on us.
TheSportOfTheGods	57	12641	12614	12671	Josy	"I think," the proprietor resumed, "that I hyeahed you say you was n't fond o' grape pickin'. Well, [MASK], my son, I would n't begin it now, 'specially as anothah kin' o' pickin' seems to run in yo' fambly."
TheSportOfTheGods	50	12942	12899	12949	Joe	He had never dreamed that anything so terrible could overtake him. Even in his straits, however, desperation gave him a certain pluck. He would try for something else for which his own tongue had not disqualified him. With [MASK], to think was to do.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	13020	12979	13027	Joe	He was a bright, spruce-looking young fellow, and the man liked his looks. "Well, I guess we can take you on," he said. "What 's your name?" "[MASK]," was the laconic answer.
TheSportOfTheGods	47	13108	13107	13154	Joe	Upon [MASK]'s advent they began to look askance at him and to talk among themselves. He felt his face burning as he thought of what they must be saying. Then he saw the head bellman talking to the clerk and looking in his direction.
TheSportOfTheGods	59	13240	13197	13256	Joe	Now, I 've got nothing against you myself. I don't hold you responsible for what your father did, but I don't believe our boys would work with you. I can't take you on." [MASK] turned away to meet the grinning or contemptuous glances of the bellmen on the seat.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	13382	13353	13402	Kit	For a while he wandered aimlessly about and then turned dejectedly homeward. His mother had not yet come. "Did you get a job?" was [MASK]'s first question. "No," he answered bitterly, "no one wants me now."
TheSportOfTheGods	47	13411	13403	13450	Joe	"No one wants you? Why, [MASK]--they--they don't think hard of us, do they?" "I don't know what they think of ma and you, but they think hard of me, all right."
TheSportOfTheGods	52	13754	13736	13788	Fannie	I 've got some tea made for you, and you just take a cup." [MASK] sat down and tried to drink her tea, but she could not. It stuck in her throat, and the tears rolled down her face and fell into the shaking cup.
TheSportOfTheGods	58	13789	13789	13847	Joe	[MASK] looked on silently. He had been out and he understood. "I 'll go out to-morrow and do some looking around for a house while you stay at home an' rest, ma." Her mother looked up, the maternal instinct for the protection of her daughter at once aroused.
TheSportOfTheGods	59	13856	13802	13861	Kitty	"I 'll go out to-morrow and do some looking around for a house while you stay at home an' rest, ma." Her mother looked up, the maternal instinct for the protection of her daughter at once aroused. "Oh, no, not you, [MASK]," she said.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	13921	13900	13950	Jones	Whaih you been to?" "I 've been out huntin' work. I 've been to [MASK]'s bahbah shop an' to the Continental Hotel." His light-brown face turned brick red with anger and shame at the memory of it.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	13963	13932	13984	Kitty	" His light-brown face turned brick red with anger and shame at the memory of it. "I don't think I 'll try any more." [MASK] was gazing with wide and saddening eyes at her mother. "Were they mean to you too, ma?
TheSportOfTheGods	44	13996	13996	14040	Kitty	[MASK]! you don't know what it was like. It nigh killed me. Thaih was plenty of houses an' owned by people I 've knowed fu' yeahs, but not one of 'em wanted to rent to me.
TheSportOfTheGods	47	14185	14142	14189	Joe	"Even if they don't know any better than to believe that pa was guilty, they know we ain't done anything." "I 'd like to cut the heart out of a few of 'em," said [MASK] in his throat.
TheSportOfTheGods	43	14208	14190	14233	Joe	"It ain't goin' to do no good to look at it that a-way, [MASK]," his mother replied. "I know hit 's ha'd, but we got to do de bes' we kin."
TheSportOfTheGods	50	14294	14264	14314	Kitty	Do they want us to live on the levee an' steal, like some of 'em do?" "What are we goin' to do?" echoed [MASK] helplessly. "I 'd go out ef I thought I could find anythin' to work at."
TheSportOfTheGods	49	14362	14324	14373	Minty	It 'ud only be worse. De niggah men dat ust to be bowin' an' scrapin' to me an' tekin' off dey hats to me laughed in my face. I met [MASK]--an' she slurred me right in de street.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	14488	14464	14513	Kitty	"Well, we got to go," she said, rising wearily. "But where are we goin'?" wailed [MASK] in affright. "There 's no place to go to. We have n't got a house. Where 'll we go?"
TheSportOfTheGods	59	14604	14604	14663	Joe	[MASK] remained sullenly silent. His mother's faith was too stalwart for his comprehension. There was nothing like it in his own soul to interpret it. "We 'll git de secon'-han' dealah to tek ouah things to-morrer, an' then we 'll go away some place, up No'th maybe."
TheSportOfTheGods	52	14819	14768	14820	Kitty	"It 's a mighty long ways off fu' me to be sta'tin' at dis time o' life." "We want to go a long ways off." "I wonder what pa would think of it if he was here," put in [MASK].
TheSportOfTheGods	48	15013	15010	15058	Fannie	Then he saw [MASK] come out and walk about her little garden, followed by her children. He saw her as she wiped her eyes and led the way to the side gate. "Well, they 're gone," he said to his wife.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	16789	16754	16805	Kit	But by and by, from mere pretending, it becomes real. He grows callous. After that he goes to the devil very cheerfully. No such radical emotions, however, troubled [MASK]'s mind. She too stood at the windows and looked down into the street.
TheSportOfTheGods	44	17165	17159	17203	Joe	"Great place," said [MASK] wisely, in what he thought was going to be quite a man-of-the-world manner. But he burned with shame the next minute because his voice sounded so weak and youthful.
TheSportOfTheGods	41	17221	17187	17228	Kitty	But he burned with shame the next minute because his voice sounded so weak and youthful. Then too the oracle only said "Yes" to him, and went on expatiating to [MASK] on the glories of the metropolis.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	17528	17519	17568	Kitty	His mother was still a little doubtful, and [MASK] was sure she found the young man "fresh." He came in pretty soon with his beer, and a half-dozen crabs in a bag. "Thought I 'd bring home something to chew.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	17635	17611	17661	Kitty	"What, don't you drink beer? Oh, come now, you 'll get out o' that." "[MASK] don't drink no beer," broke in her mother with mild resentment. "I drinks it sometimes, but she don't.
TheSportOfTheGods	53	17823	17795	17848	Joe	"You neither?" "Oh, I drink it," said the boy with an air, but not looking at his mother. "[MASK]," she cried to him, "you must ricollect you ain't at home. What 'ud yo' pa think?
TheSportOfTheGods	50	18171	18152	18202	Joe	Great singin', you know. What d' you say?" The mother hesitated, and [MASK] filled the breach. "We 'd all like to go," he said. "Ma, we' ll go if you ain't too tired."
TheSportOfTheGods	53	18450	18407	18460	Kitty	She had somewhat receded from her first position, that it was better being here in the great strange city than being at home where the very streets shamed them. She had not liked the way that their fellow lodger looked at [MASK]. It was bold, to say the least.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	18512	18501	18552	Thomas	There was a difference, however, which she recognised. [MASK] was not the provincial who puts every one on a par with himself, nor was he the metropolitan who complacently patronises the whole world. He was trained out of the one and not up to the other.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	18749	18713	18764	Thomas	Here, too, the party's guide seemed to be well known, for some one said, before they passed out of hearing, "I wonder who that little light girl is that [MASK] is with to-night? He 's a hot one for you."
TheSportOfTheGods	43	19674	19665	19708	Kitty	The cheap dresses on the street had not fooled [MASK] for an instant, but take the same cheese-cloth, put a little water starch into it, and put it on the stage, and she could see only chiffon.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	19789	19742	19791	Joe	He had eyes and ears and thoughts only for the stage. His nerves tingled and his hands twitched. Only to know one of those radiant creatures, to have her speak to him, smile at him! If ever a man was intoxicated, [MASK] was.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	20122	20122	20168	Joe	[MASK] looked at them hungrily, but the man in front with his sister did not think it necessary to include the brother or the rest of the party in his miscellaneous introductions. One brief bit of conversation which the mother overheard especially troubled her.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	20192	20156	20208	Thomas	One brief bit of conversation which the mother overheard especially troubled her. "Not going out for a minute or two?" asked one of the men, as he was turning away from [MASK]. "No, I don't think I 'll go out to-night.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	20709	20709	20761	Joe	[MASK] lingered a little longer. "Say, that was out o' sight," he said. "Think so?" asked the other carelessly. "I 'd like to get out with you some time to see the town," the boy went on eagerly.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	20801	20762	20811	Joe	"All right, we 'll go some time. So long." "So long." Some time. Was it true? Would he really take him out and let him meet stage people? [MASK] went to bed with his head in a whirl.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	20841	20830	20879	Joe	Whatever else his visit to the theatre may have done for [MASK], it inspired him with a desire to go to work and earn money of his own, to be independent both of parental help and control, and so be able to spend as he pleased.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	21101	21072	21120	Kitty	This had been without success, as both the girl and her mother held themselves politely aloof from him. He began to see that his hope of winning [MASK]'s affections lay, not in courting the older woman but in making a friend of the boy.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	21446	21421	21473	Thomas	"Oh, I 'll act; we 'll all act." "Be slow to take a drink from him." "[MASK], my boy, you 're an angel. I recognise that more and more every day, but bid me do anything else but that.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	21618	21595	21646	Joe	As they stood at the bar, the men began strolling up one by one. Each in his turn was introduced to [MASK]. They were very polite. They treated him with a pale, dignified, high-minded respect that menaced his pocket-book and possessions.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	21770	21762	21814	Joe	I have never recovered from it." [MASK] was not quite sure how to take this; but the others laughed and he joined them, and then, to cover his own embarrassment, he did what he thought the only correct and manly thing to do,--he ordered a drink.
TheSportOfTheGods	41	21827	21815	21856	Sadness	"I don't know as I ought to," said [MASK]. "Oh, come on," his companions called out, "don't be stiff with a stranger. Make him feel at home."
TheSportOfTheGods	46	22010	21992	22038	Sadness	The men warmed towards him. They took several more drinks with him and he was happy. [MASK] put his arm about his shoulder and told him, with tears in his eyes, that he looked like a cousin of his that had died.
TheSportOfTheGods	41	22058	22053	22094	Sadness	"Be respectable." [MASK] turned his mournful eyes upon the speaker. "I won't," he replied. "Being respectable is very nice as a diversion, but it 's tedious if done steadily."
TheSportOfTheGods	50	22268	22244	22294	Joe	We have lots of nice people here on smoker nights, especially after the shows are out and the girls come in." [MASK]'s heart gave a great leap, and then settled as cold as lead. Of course, those girls would n't speak to him.
TheSportOfTheGods	45	22398	22363	22408	Joe	He tapped one confidentially on the shoulder, as who should say, "My dear boy, I have but two friends in the world, and you are both of them." [MASK], charmed and pleased, kept his head well.
TheSportOfTheGods	44	22820	22814	22858	Thomas	It was into this atmosphere that [MASK] had introduced the boy Joe, and he sat there now by his side, firing his mind by pointing out the different celebrities who came in and telling highly flavoured stories of their lives or doings.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	22989	22976	23022	Joe	In the moment that it took the young man to reach them, [MASK] wondered if he would ever reach that state when he could call that white man Skaggsy and the girl Maudie. The new-comer soon set all of that at ease.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	23135	23126	23176	Skaggsy	"Not a bit of it," said [MASK], "not a bit of it. When I meet my friends I always reserve to myself the right of ordering the first drink. Waiter, this is on me. What 'll you have, gentlemen?"
TheSportOfTheGods	47	23184	23144	23191	Skaggsy	When I meet my friends I always reserve to myself the right of ordering the first drink. Waiter, this is on me. What 'll you have, gentlemen?" They got their drinks, and then [MASK] leaned over confidentially and began talking.
TheSportOfTheGods	58	23459	23402	23460	Skaggsy	It was the same old story that the white who associates with negroes from volition usually tells to explain his taste. The truth about the young reporter was that he was born and reared on a Vermont farm, where his early life was passed in fighting for his very subsistence. But this never troubled [MASK].
TheSportOfTheGods	49	23542	23538	23587	Maudie	"Now look at [MASK]," he went on; "would you believe it that she was of a fine, rich family, and that the coloured girl she 's dancing with now used to be her servant? She 's just like me about that.
TheSportOfTheGods	53	23902	23902	23955	Joe	[MASK] looked upon him as a hero. He was followed by a little, brown-skinned fellow with an immature Vandyke beard and a lisp. He sung his own composition and was funny; how much funnier than he himself knew or intended, may not even be hinted at.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	23982	23956	24005	Joe	Then, while an instrumentalist, who seemed to have a grudge against the piano, was hammering out the opening bars of a march, [MASK]'s attention was attracted by a woman entering the room, and from that moment he heard no more of the concert.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	24123	24084	24132	Joe	She was a good-looking young woman and daintily made, though her face was no longer youthful, and one might have wished that with her complexion she had not run to silk waists in magenta. [MASK], however, saw no fault in her.
TheSportOfTheGods	58	24325	24325	24383	Joe	[MASK] could hardly believe in his own good luck, and his head, which was getting a bit weak, was near collapsing when his divinity asked him what he 'd have? He began to protest, until she told the waiter with an air of authority to make it a little "'skey."
TheSportOfTheGods	44	24414	24406	24450	Thomas	When the drinks came, she said to [MASK], "Now, old man, you 've been awfully nice, but when you get your little drink, you run away like a good little boy. You 're superfluous."
TheSportOfTheGods	46	24722	24692	24738	Kitty	She knew that although he worked he never had any money for the house, and she foresaw the time when the little they had would no longer suffice for [MASK] and her. Realising this, she herself set out to find something to do.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	25137	25117	25165	Berry	There were times when she felt that there was nothing left to work or fight for. The letters from [MASK] in prison became fewer and fewer. He was sinking into the dull, dead routine of his life. Her own letters to him fell off.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	25346	25309	25361	Hattie	He was proud of himself when he went behind the scenes at the theatre or waited for her at the stage door and bore her off under the admiring eyes of a crowd of gapers. And [MASK]? She liked him in a half-contemptuous, half-amused way.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	25542	25541	25591	Hattie	But [MASK] was going on about her work and evidently knew nothing. "Oh, you need n't pretend you don't know her," she went on banteringly. "She says you were great friends down South, so I 've invited her to supper.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	25736	25716	25764	Hattie	Would she yet tell, and if she did, what would happen? He tortured himself by questioning if [MASK] would cast him off. At the very thought his hand trembled, and the man in the chair asked him if he had n't been drinking.
TheSportOfTheGods	56	25768	25742	25798	Minty	At the very thought his hand trembled, and the man in the chair asked him if he had n't been drinking. When he met [MASK] in the evening, however, the first glance at her reassured him. Her face was wreathed in smiles as she came forward and held out her hand.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	25836	25829	25880	Minty	"I 'm middlin', [MASK]. How 's yourself?" He was so happy that he could n't let go her hand. "An' jes' look at the boy! Ef he ain't got the impidence to be waihin' a mustache too.
TheSportOfTheGods	41	26018	26002	26043	Minty	"They 're both right well." He had forgotten them and their scorn of [MASK]. "Whaih do you live? I 'm comin' roun' to see 'em." He hesitated for a moment.
TheSportOfTheGods	57	26052	26020	26077	Kit	"Whaih do you live? I 'm comin' roun' to see 'em." He hesitated for a moment. He knew how his mother, if not [MASK], would receive her, and yet he dared not anger this woman, who had his fate in the hollow of her hand.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	26386	26378	26427	Kitty	I 'm ashamed o' you, [MASK], fu' wantin' me to." The girl began to cry, while her brother walked the floor angrily. "You 'll see what 'll happen," he cried; "you 'll see."
TheSportOfTheGods	52	26428	26428	26480	Fannie	[MASK] looked at her son, and she seemed to see him more clearly than she had ever seen him before,--his foppery, his meanness, his cowardice. "Well," she answered with a sigh, "it can't be no wuss den what 's already happened."
TheSportOfTheGods	48	27104	27092	27140	Fannie	see what you 've done with your damned foolishness." [MASK] turned on him like a tigress. "Don't you cuss hyeah befo' me; I ain't nevah brung you up to it, an' I won't stan' it.
TheSportOfTheGods	57	27294	27247	27304	Joe	"Oh, go on," she said, "go on. It 's been a long time sence you been my son. You on yo' way to hell, an' you is been fu' lo dese many days." [MASK] got out of the house as soon as possible.
TheSportOfTheGods	53	27359	27317	27370	Kit	He felt like a cur, because he knew deep down in his heart that he had only been waiting for some excuse to take this step. As he slammed the door behind him, his mother flung herself down by [MASK]'s side and mingled her tears with her daughter's.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	27919	27874	27922	Sadness	He sat brooding over his trouble until the bartender called with respectful sarcasm to ask if he wanted to lease the glass he had. He gave back a silly laugh, gulped the rest of the liquor down, and was ordering another when [MASK] came in.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	28010	27991	28037	Joe	The dear old girl has n't been getting hysterical at her age? Let us hope not." [MASK] glared at him. Why in the devil should this fellow be so sadly gay when he was weighted down with sorrow and shame and disgust?
TheSportOfTheGods	51	28044	28015	28066	Hamilton	Why in the devil should this fellow be so sadly gay when he was weighted down with sorrow and shame and disgust? "Come, come now, [MASK], if you 're sore because I invited myself to take a drink with you, I 'll withdraw the order.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	28162	28134	28183	Joe	"Well, then, out with it. What is it? Have n't been up to anything, have you?" The desire came to [MASK] to tell this man the whole truth, just what was the matter, and so to relieve his heart.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	28196	28184	28232	Sadness	On the impulse he did. If he had expected much from [MASK] he was disappointed, for not a muscle of the man's face changed during the entire recital. When it was over, he looked at his companion critically through a wreath of smoke.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	28499	28497	28548	Viola	That 's [MASK]. Two years ago she wrenched up an iron stool from the floor of a lunch-room, and killed another woman with it. She 's nineteen,--just about your age, by the way. Well, she had friends with a certain amount of pull.
TheSportOfTheGods	57	28567	28564	28621	Hamilton	You see, [MASK], in this life we are all suffering from fever, and no one edges away from the other because he finds him a little warm. It 's dangerous when you 're not used to it; but once you go through the parching process, you become inoculated against further contagion.
TheSportOfTheGods	53	28626	28595	28648	Barney	It 's dangerous when you 're not used to it; but once you go through the parching process, you become inoculated against further contagion. Now, there 's [MASK] over there, as decent a fellow as I know; but he has been indicted twice for pocket-picking.
TheSportOfTheGods	54	28678	28665	28719	Wallace	Others have done worse things for which you respect them less. Poor [MASK], who is just coming in, and who looks like a jaunty ragpicker, came here about six months ago with about two thousand dollars, the proceeds from the sale of a house his father had left him.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	28795	28792	28843	Wallace	From now on [MASK] will live, eat, drink, and sleep at the expense of others, and will forget to mourn his lost money. He will go on this way until, broken and useless, the poor-house or the potter's field gets him.
TheSportOfTheGods	53	28968	28928	28981	Sadness	If he could only have understood all that the man was saying to him, he might even yet have turned back. But he did n't. He ordered another drink. The only effect that the talk of [MASK] had upon him was to make him feel wonderfully "in it.
TheSportOfTheGods	47	29077	29046	29093	Joe	"You lie," he cried, "I have n't; I was only fool enough to try;" and he turned hastily away from the table. [MASK] looked surprised at first, and then laughed at his friend's retreating form. "
TheSportOfTheGods	41	29124	29094	29135	Sadness	Poor old fellow," he said, "drunk again. Must have had something before he came in." There was not a lie in all that [MASK] had said either as to their crime or their condition.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	29679	29642	29688	Minty	"Yes, but jest out o' pity, an' you was nice 'cause you was afraid I 'd tell on you. Go on now." "Go on now," said [MASK]'s young man; and he looked menacing.
TheSportOfTheGods	53	29762	29740	29793	Hattie	The closing act was just over when he reached the stage door. He was there but a short time, when [MASK] tripped out and took his arm. Her face was bright and smiling, and there was no suggestion of disgust in the dancing eyes she turned up to him.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	29956	29940	29990	Joe	"And you still keep on speaking to me?" "Now look here, [MASK], if you 've been drinking, I 'll forgive you; if you ain't, you go on and leave me. Say, what do you take me for?
TheSportOfTheGods	46	30017	30016	30062	Minty	When [MASK] told me that story, she was back in my dressing-room, and I sent her out o' there a-flying, and with a tongue-lashing that she won't forget for a month o' Sundays."
TheSportOfTheGods	50	30092	30063	30113	Sadness	"I reckon that was the reason she jumped on me so hard at the club." He chuckled. He had taken heart again. All that [MASK] had said was true, after all, and people thought no less of him. His joy was unbounded.
TheSportOfTheGods	43	30145	30109	30152	Joe	His joy was unbounded. "So she jumped on you hard, did she? The cat!" "Oh, she did n't say a thing to me." "Well, [MASK], it 's just like this.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	30230	30201	30252	Hattie	Why, old chap, I believe I like you better for the stiff upper lip you 've been keeping under all this." "Why, [MASK]," he broke out, unable any longer to control himself, "you 're--you 're----" "
TheSportOfTheGods	47	30447	30444	30491	Sadness	She was beckoning [MASK] to her side. He came and sat down. "Now look here," she said, "you can't have any supper because you have n't reached the stage of magnificent hunger to make a meal palatable to you.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	30574	30525	30575	Griggs	Your thirst is always available.--Jack," she called down the long room to the bartender, "make it three.--Lean over here, I want to talk to you. See that woman over there by the wall? No, not that one,--the big light woman with [MASK].
TheSportOfTheGods	44	31115	31074	31118	Hattie	"You 've told me once or twice that your sister could sing. Bring her down here to me, and if she can do anything, I 'll get her a place on the stage," was [MASK]'s answer.
TheSportOfTheGods	53	31212	31178	31231	Joe	The actress was very gracious to her, and called her "child" in a pretty, patronising way, and patted her on the cheek. "It 's a shame that [MASK] has n't brought you around before. We 've been good friends for quite some time."
TheSportOfTheGods	56	31318	31282	31338	Joe	So you think you want to go on the stage, do you?" "Yes, 'm, I thought it might be right nice for me if I could." "[MASK], go out and get some beer for us, and then I 'll hear your sister sing."
TheSportOfTheGods	53	31442	31411	31464	Joe	The encouragement helped her, and she did better as she became more at home. "Why, child, you 've got a good voice. And, [MASK], you 've been keeping her shut up all this time. You ought to be ashamed of yourself."
TheSportOfTheGods	49	31476	31473	31522	Kitty	He had brought [MASK] almost under a protest, because he had no confidence in her ability and thought that his "girl" would disillusion her. It did not please him now to find his sister so fully under the limelight and himself "up stage."
TheSportOfTheGods	52	31523	31501	31553	Kitty	It did not please him now to find his sister so fully under the limelight and himself "up stage." [MASK] was quite in a flutter of delight; not so much with the idea of working as with the glamour of the work she might be allowed to do.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	31626	31605	31651	Kitty	It 's nice and homelike, and then we 've got to be great chums, you know." [MASK], unwilling to refuse anything from the sorceress, took her cigarette and lighted it, but a few puffs set her off coughing.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	31866	31853	31901	Kit	"Oh, I would n't want to push anybody out," [MASK] expostulated. "Oh, never mind, you 'll soon get bravely over that feeling, and even if you did n't it would n't matter much. The thing has to happen.
TheSportOfTheGods	47	32027	32014	32061	Kitty	"Don't you let what I say scare you, though, [MASK]. You 've got a good chance, and maybe you 'll have more sense than I 've got, and at least save money--while you 're in it.
TheSportOfTheGods	45	32195	32158	32203	Kitty	Of course, he 'll be pretty rough, he always is at rehearsals, but he 'll take to you if he thinks there 's anything in you and he can get it out." [MASK] felt herself dismissed and rose to go.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	32216	32209	32260	Kit	"I 'll see you later, [MASK]," he said; "I ain't goin' just yet. Say," he added, when his sister was gone, "you 're a hot one. What do you want to give her all that con for?
TheSportOfTheGods	44	32443	32410	32454	Joe	That 's the worst of it. They go around thinking they 're it, when they ain't even in the game. Go on and get the beer." And [MASK] went, feeling vaguely that he had been sat upon.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	32574	32530	32578	Kit	F'om what I see of dem stage people dey don't seem to 'mount to much. De way dem gals shows demse'ves is right down bad to me. Is you goin' to dress lak dem we seen dat night?" [MASK] hung her head.
TheSportOfTheGods	43	32607	32579	32622	Kit	"I guess I 'll have to." "Well, ef you have to, I 'd ruther see you daid any day. Oh, [MASK], my little gal, don't do it, don't do it.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	32706	32704	32754	Joe	She ruint [MASK], an' she 's aftah you now." "But nowadays everybody thinks stage people respectable up here." "Maybe I 'm ol'-fashioned, but I can't believe in any ooman's ladyship when she shows herse'f lak dem gals does.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	32757	32717	32769	Kit	"But nowadays everybody thinks stage people respectable up here." "Maybe I 'm ol'-fashioned, but I can't believe in any ooman's ladyship when she shows herse'f lak dem gals does. Oh, [MASK], don't do it. Ain't you seen enough?
TheSportOfTheGods	48	32844	32809	32857	Kit	"You must n't feel that away, ma. I 'm doin' it to help you." "I do' want no sich help. I 'd ruther starve." [MASK] did not reply, but there was no yielding in her manner.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	32978	32971	33023	Kit	I would n't min' dat, [MASK], but he say dat at Be'y's age dey ain't much chanst of his livin' to git out, an' hyeah I 'll live all dis time alone, an' den have no one to tek keer o' me
TheSportOfTheGods	52	33053	33052	33104	Joe	But [MASK], he 's gone, an' ef yo go, befo' Gawd I 'll tell Tawm Gibson yes." The mother looked up to see just what effect her plea would have on her daughter. She hoped that what she said would have the desired result.
TheSportOfTheGods	57	33300	33254	33311	Gawd	All right," she said, "I 'll do it; I 'll ma'y him. I might as well go de way both my chillen 's gone. Po' Be'y, po' Be'y. Ef you evah do come out, [MASK] he'p you to baih what you 'll fin'."
TheSportOfTheGods	41	33335	33335	33376	Kit	[MASK] stood looking after her, fear and grief in her eyes. "Poor ma," she said, "an' poor pa. But I know, an' I know it 's for the best."
TheSportOfTheGods	52	33397	33349	33401	Martin	Poor ma," she said, "an' poor pa. But I know, an' I know it 's for the best." On the next morning she was up early and practising hard for her interview with the managing star of "[MASK]'s Blackbirds."
TheSportOfTheGods	51	33678	33659	33710	Kitty	From his head to his feet he was the very epitome of self-sufficient, brutal conceit. [MASK] trembled as she noted the hush that fell on the people at his entrance. She felt like rushing out of the room. She could never face this terrible man.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	33770	33723	33771	Hattie	"Who 's that?" he asked, disregarding her, as if she had been a stick or a stone. "Well, don't snap her head off. It 's a girl friend of mine that wants a place," said [MASK].
TheSportOfTheGods	45	33783	33782	33827	Humph	"[MASK]. Let her wait. I ain't got no time to hear any one now. Get yourselves in line, you all who are on to that first chorus, while I 'm getting into my sweat-shirt."
TheSportOfTheGods	48	33955	33942	33990	Taylor	Are your joints rusty? Do you want oil? Look here, [MASK], if I did n't know you, I 'd take you for a truck. Pick up your feet, open your mouths, and move, move, move! Oh!"
TheSportOfTheGods	48	34151	34116	34164	Kitty	Don't be afraid to move. Step like a chicken on a hot griddle!" And some blushing girl would come forward and go through the step alone before all the rest. [MASK] contemplated the scene with a mind equally divided between fear and anger.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	34411	34369	34418	Tom	Well, let 's hear something. Do you know any of these?" And he ran over the titles of several songs. She knew some of them, and he selected one. "Try this. Here, [MASK], play it for her."
TheSportOfTheGods	48	34528	34489	34537	Martin	At the first her voice wavered and threatened to fail her. It must not. She choked back her fright and forced the music from her lips. When she was done, she was startled to hear [MASK] burst into a raucous laugh. Such humiliation!
TheSportOfTheGods	46	34602	34593	34639	Martin	"Haw, haw, haw!" laughed [MASK], "haw, haw, haw! The little one was scared, see? She was scared, d' you understand? But did you see the grit she went at it with?
TheSportOfTheGods	51	34688	34657	34708	Kitty	Now, that 's what I like. If all you girls had that spirit, we could do something in two weeks. Try another one, girl." [MASK]'s heart had suddenly grown light. She sang the second one better because something within her was singing.
TheSportOfTheGods	45	34714	34709	34754	Martin	"Good!" said [MASK], but he immediately returned to his cold manner. "You watch these girls close and see what they do, and to-morrow be prepared to go into line and move as well as sing."
TheSportOfTheGods	44	34923	34911	34955	Kitty	He also was proud, and after the performance he waited for [MASK] at the stage door and went forward to meet her as she came out. The look she gave him stopped him, and he let her pass without a word.
TheSportOfTheGods	53	35073	35028	35081	Joe	"Say," she said, "if you come this way for me again, it 's all over, see? Your little sister 's a comer, and I 've got to hustle to keep up with her." [MASK] growled and fell asleep in his chair.
TheSportOfTheGods	53	35267	35226	35279	Frank	They had letters from him now and then, never very cheerful in tone, but always breathing the deepest love and gratitude to them. His brother found deep cause for congratulation in the tone of these epistles. "[MASK] is getting down to work," he would cry exultantly.
TheSportOfTheGods	54	35342	35333	35387	Frank	The two had frequent questions to answer as to [MASK]'s doing and prospects, and they had always bright things to say of him, even when his letters gave them no such warrant. Their love for him made them read large between the lines, and all they read was good.
TheSportOfTheGods	41	35389	35369	35410	Maurice	Their love for him made them read large between the lines, and all they read was good. Between [MASK] and his brother no word of the guilty servant ever passed. They each avoided it as an unpleasant subject.
TheSportOfTheGods	43	35492	35455	35498	Maurice	"By no means," replied her husband. "You know that it would only hurt him. He shall never know if I have to tell him." "You are right, [MASK], you are always right.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	35558	35554	35604	Frank	They would have written [MASK] to urge it, but they both believed that to try to woo him away from his art was but to make him more wayward. That any woman could have power enough to take him away from this jealous mistress they very much doubted.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	35652	35605	35653	Claire	But they could hope, and hope made them eager to open every letter that bore the French postmark. Always it might contain news that he was coming home, or that he had made a great success, or, better, some inquiry after [MASK].
TheSportOfTheGods	45	35719	35704	35749	Frank	His eyes glistened with pleasure as he read the postmark. "A letter from [MASK]," he said joyfully, "and an important one, I 'll wager." He smiled as he weighed it in his hand and caressed it.
TheSportOfTheGods	58	35978	35957	36015	Frank	Let him say, for instance, that the letter told of the completion and sale of a great picture. [MASK] had sold small ones. He would be glad of this, for his brother had written him several times of things that were a-doing, but not yet of anything that was done.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	36163	36156	36207	Frank	In his mind's eye he saw [MASK], unconscious of his own power or too modest to admit it, stand unknown among the crowds around his picture waiting for and dreading their criticisms. He saw the light leap to his eyes as he heard their words of praise.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	36373	36340	36390	Leslie	The letter drew his eyes back to it. It seemed to invite him, to beg him even. "No, I will not do it; I will wait until [MASK] comes. She will be as glad to hear the good news as I am."
TheSportOfTheGods	53	36423	36376	36429	Frank	She will be as glad to hear the good news as I am." His dreams were taking the shape of reality in his mind, and he was believing all that he wanted to believe. He turned to look at a picture painted by [MASK] which hung over the mantel.
TheSportOfTheGods	56	36722	36668	36724	Leslie	He would just cut the envelope and make believe he had read it to pique his wife; but he would not read it. Yes, that was it. He found the knife and slit the paper. His fingers trembled as he touched the sheets that protruded. Why would not [MASK] come?
TheSportOfTheGods	41	36801	36764	36805	Oakley	There was a sound of footsteps without. He sprang up, crying, "I 've been waiting so long for you!" A servant opened the door to bring him a message. [MASK] dismissed him angrily.
TheSportOfTheGods	54	36860	36860	36914	Leslie	[MASK] was careless and unfeeling. She ought to come; he was tired of waiting. A carriage rolled up the driveway and he dropped the letter guiltily, as if it were not his own. He would only say that he had grown tired of waiting and started to read it.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	37042	37001	37052	Leslie	He laid it on the desk once more. It leered at him. He might just open the sheets enough to see the lines that began it, and read no further. Yes, he would do that. [MASK] could not feel hurt at such a little thing.
TheSportOfTheGods	47	37104	37080	37127	Leslie	The second line held him, and the third, and the fourth, and as he read on, unmindful now of what [MASK] might think or feel, his face turned from the ruddy glow of pleasant anxiety to the pallor of grief and terror.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	37216	37171	37217	Maurice	Then, with a cry that echoed through the house, crumpling the sheets in his hand, he fell forward fainting to the floor, just as his wife rushed into the room. "What is it?" she cried. "[MASK]!
TheSportOfTheGods	47	37218	37218	37265	Maurice	[MASK]!" He lay on the floor staring up at the ceiling, the letter clutched in his hands. She ran to him and lifted up his head, but he gave no sign of life. Already the servants were crowding to the door.
TheSportOfTheGods	57	37368	37324	37381	Frank	Without a thought of wrong, for they had no secrets from each other, she glanced at the opening lines. Then she forgot the unconscious man at her feet and read the letter through to the end. The letter was in [MASK]'s neat hand, a little shaken, perhaps, by nervousness.
TheSportOfTheGods	47	37634	37612	37659	Berry	It was not; I had a deeper reason. I knew where the money had gone and dared not tell. [MASK] is as innocent as yourself--and I--well, it is a story, and let me tell it to you."
TheSportOfTheGods	51	37747	37718	37769	Claire	I do not mean that I am drunk. I can think clearly and write clearly, but my emotions are extremely active." "Do you remember [MASK]'s saying at the table that night of the farewell dinner that some dark-eyed mademoiselle was waiting for me?
TheSportOfTheGods	49	38109	38067	38116	Berry	So I lied to you. The money from my cabinet was not stolen save by myself. I am a liar and a thief, but your eyes shall never tell me so." "Tell the truth and have [MASK] released. I can stand it.
TheSportOfTheGods	47	38173	38128	38175	FRANK	Do not plead with me, do not forgive me, do not seek to find me, for from this time I shall be as one who has perished from the earth; I shall be no more." "Your brother, [MASK]."
TheSportOfTheGods	51	38435	38403	38454	Frank	"Oh, my God," he moaned, "my brother, my brother!" "'Sh, dearie, think--it 's--it 's--[MASK]." "That 's it, that 's it--that 's what I can't forget.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	38499	38494	38540	Maurice	"No one shall, [MASK]; come, let us burn it." "Burn it? No, no," he cried, clutching at his breast. "It must not be burned. What! burn my brother's secret?
TheSportOfTheGods	46	38562	38526	38572	Maurice----	"It must not be burned. What! burn my brother's secret? No, no, I must carry it with me,--carry it with me to the grave." "But, [MASK]" "I must carry it with me."
TheSportOfTheGods	54	38715	38675	38729	Oakley	"It 's a strange case," he said; "there 's something more than the nervous shock that makes him clutch his chest like that, and yet I have never noticed signs of heart trouble in [MASK]. Oh, well, business worry will produce anything in anybody."
TheSportOfTheGods	45	39041	39040	39085	Joe	In [MASK]'s case even a shorter time was needed. He was so ready to go down that it needed but a gentle push to start him, and once started, there was nothing within him to hold him back from the depths.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	39275	39233	39279	Sadness	She kept her promise and threw him over. Then he became a hanger-on at the clubs, a genteel loafer. He used to say in his sober moments that at last he was one of the boys that [MASK] had spoken of.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	39306	39280	39331	Hattie	He did not work, and yet he lived and ate and was proud of his degradation. But he soon tired of being separated from [MASK], and straightened up again. After some demur she received him upon his former footing. It was only for a few months.
TheSportOfTheGods	54	40038	39994	40048	Skaggsy	However, he mourned truly for his lost companion, and to-night he was in a particularly pensive mood. Some one was playing rag-time on the piano, and the dancers were wheeling in time to the music. [MASK] looked at them regretfully as he sipped his liquor.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	40168	40159	40211	Joe	Really, it 's a waste of time for [MASK] to sober up. Hullo there!" as the young man brought up against him; "take a seat." He put him in a chair at the table. "Been lushin' a bit, eh?"
TheSportOfTheGods	54	40244	40192	40246	Jack	He put him in a chair at the table. "Been lushin' a bit, eh?" "Gi' me some'n' drink." "Oh, a hair of the dog. Some men shave their dogs clean, and then have hydrophobia. Here, [MASK]!"
TheSportOfTheGods	49	40423	40416	40465	Jove	He scented a story. "By [MASK]!" he exclaimed, "did you hear that? Bet the chap stole it himself and 's letting the old man suffer for it. Great story, ain't it? Come, come, wake up here.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	40469	40426	40475	Jack	he exclaimed, "did you hear that? Bet the chap stole it himself and 's letting the old man suffer for it. Great story, ain't it? Come, come, wake up here. Three more, [MASK]. What about your father?
TheSportOfTheGods	49	40555	40531	40580	Skaggsy	Ol' man di' n' steal it, know he di' n'." "Oh, let him alone, [MASK], he don't know what he 's saying." "Yes, he does, a drunken man tells the truth."
TheSportOfTheGods	48	40588	40581	40629	Sadness	"In some cases," said [MASK]. "Oh, let me alone, man. I 've been trying for years to get a big sensation for my paper, and if this story is one, I 'm a made man."
TheSportOfTheGods	47	40643	40630	40677	Skaggs	The drink seemed to revive the young man again, and by bits [MASK] was able to pick out of him the story of his father's arrest and conviction. At its close he relapsed into stupidity, murmuring, "She throwed me down."
TheSportOfTheGods	47	40683	40661	40708	Sadness	At its close he relapsed into stupidity, murmuring, "She throwed me down." "Well," sneered [MASK], "you see drunken men tell the truth, and you don't seem to get much guilt out of our young friend.
TheSportOfTheGods	52	40759	40709	40761	Sadness	You 're disappointed, are n't you?" "I confess I am disappointed, but I 've got an idea, just the same." "Oh, you have? Well, don't handle it carelessly; it might go off." And [MASK] rose.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	40775	40762	40812	Joe	The reporter sat thinking for a time and then followed him, leaving [MASK] in a drunken sleep at the table. There he lay for more than two hours. When he finally awoke, he started up as if some determination had come to him in his sleep.
TheSportOfTheGods	47	40881	40874	40921	Hattie	It was very late when he reached [MASK]'s door, but he opened it with his latch-key, as he had been used to do. He stopped to help himself to a glass of brandy, as he had so often done before.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	41521	41511	41560	Joe	XV "DEAR, DAMNED, DELIGHTFUL TOWN" When [MASK] was taken, there was no spirit or feeling left in him. He moved mechanically, as if without sense or volition. The first impression he gave was that of a man over-acting insanity.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	41874	41854	41900	Jack	"I saw him," he said with a shudder, "and it 'll take more whiskey than [MASK] can give me in a year to wash the memory of him out of me. Why, man, it shocked me all through.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	41933	41931	41981	Sadness	And so [MASK] and all the club, with a muttered "Poor devil!" dismissed him. He was gone. Why should they worry? Only one more who had got into the whirlpool, enjoyed the sensation for a moment, and then swept dizzily down.
TheSportOfTheGods	59	42762	42733	42792	Joe	The greatest sign of interest she showed in her brother's affair was, at first, to offer her mother money to secure a lawyer. But when [MASK] confessed all, she consoled herself with the reflection that perhaps it was for the best, and kept her money in her pocket with a sense of satisfaction.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	42802	42793	42844	Joe	She was getting to be so very much more [MASK]'s sister. She did not go to see her brother. She was afraid it might make her nervous while she was in the city, and she went on the road with her company before he was taken away.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	43173	43124	43175	Skaggs	"It would be a big thing for the paper," he said, "if it only panned out; but it is such a rattle-brained, harum-scarum thing. No one under the sun would have thought of it but you, [MASK]."
TheSportOfTheGods	49	43300	43294	43343	Skaggs	It is almost a question whether [MASK] had a theory or whether he had told himself a pretty story and, as usual, believed it. The editor was right. No one else would have thought of the wild thing that was in the reporter's mind.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	43497	43466	43517	Thither	This was no difficult matter, as the bar of the Continental was still the gathering-place of some of the city's choice spirits of the old regime. [MASK] he went, and his convivial cheerfulness soon placed him on terms of equality with many of his kind.
TheSportOfTheGods	48	43646	43632	43680	Beachfield	I remember the night we were all discussing that Hamilton nigger's arrest, [MASK] said it was a sign of total depravity because his man hunted 'possums with his hound." The old man laughed inanely. The hotel whiskey was getting on his nerves.
TheSportOfTheGods	43	44007	43998	44041	Davis	The negroes----" "Total depravity," said [MASK]. "Now look at my dog----" "If you will retire with me to the further table I will give you whatever of the facts I can call to mind."
TheSportOfTheGods	49	44457	44424	44473	Sh	"It is strange." "Strange it is, but I have my theory." "His actions are like those of a man guarding a secret." "[MASK]! His negro laundress says that there is an inside pocket in his undershirts."
TheSportOfTheGods	51	44490	44474	44525	Skaggs	"An inside pocket?" "Yes." "And for what?" [MASK] was trembling with eagerness. The Colonel dropped his voice lower. "We can only speculate," he said; "but, as I have said, I have my theory.
TheSportOfTheGods	47	44526	44503	44550	Oakley	"We can only speculate," he said; "but, as I have said, I have my theory. [MASK] was a just man, and in punishing his old servant for the supposed robbery it is plain that he acted from principle.
TheSportOfTheGods	45	44761	44739	44784	Oakley	But as for bringing it to light, no one would think of doing that. It would be sure to hurt [MASK]'s feelings, and he is of one of our best families." "Ah, yes, perfectly right."
TheSportOfTheGods	49	45082	45047	45096	Skaggs	"I can tell no one but the master of the house himself." "You cannot see him. It is against his orders." "Very well," replied [MASK], descending one step; "it is his loss, not mine.
TheSportOfTheGods	43	45166	45163	45206	Oakley	Had he seen [MASK] before he would have been shocked at the change in his appearance; but as it was, the nervous, white-haired man who stood shiftily before him told him nothing of an eating secret long carried.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	45279	45264	45314	Skaggs	"Come in, come in." His motions were nervous and erratic. [MASK] followed him into the library, and the wife disappeared in another direction. It would have been hard to recognise in the Oakley of the present the man of a few years before.
TheSportOfTheGods	45	45361	45337	45382	Skaggs	He was as a man who trembled on the brink of insanity. His guilty secret had been too much for him, and [MASK]'s own fingers twitched as he saw his host's hands seek the breast of his jacket every other moment.
TheSportOfTheGods	57	45431	45383	45440	Oakley	"It is there the secret is hidden," he said to himself, "and whatever it is, I must have it. But how--how? I can't knock the man down and rob him in his own house." But [MASK] himself proceeded to give him his first cue.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	45472	45472	45521	Skaggs	[MASK]'s mind worked quickly. He remembered the Colonel's story. Evidently the brother had something to do with the secret. "Now or never," he thought. So he said boldly, "Yes, I have a message from your brother."
TheSportOfTheGods	51	45631	45616	45667	Oakley	I am his messenger. He bids you to give it to me." [MASK] had shrunken back as if he had been struck. "No, no!" he gasped, "no, no! I have no secret." The reporter moved nearer him.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	45688	45642	45691	Skaggs	"No, no!" he gasped, "no, no! I have no secret." The reporter moved nearer him. The old man shrunk against the wall, his lips working convulsively and his hand tearing at his breast as [MASK] drew nearer.
TheSportOfTheGods	46	45765	45722	45768	Skaggs	"No, no, no! It is not his secret; it is mine. I must carry it here always, do you hear? I must carry it till I die. Go away! Go away!" [MASK] seized him.
TheSportOfTheGods	44	45796	45779	45823	Oakley	The reporter's hand sought the secret pocket. He felt a paper beneath his fingers. [MASK] gasped hoarsely as he drew it forth. Then raising his voice gave one agonised cry, and sank to the floor frothing at the mouth.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	45903	45868	45917	Skaggs	"But his breast is open. Your hand has been in his bosom. You have taken something from him. Give it to me, or I shall call for help." [MASK] had not reckoned on this, but his wits came to the rescue.
TheSportOfTheGods	54	46403	46392	46446	Oakley	There was a strong pen-picture of the man, [MASK], grown haggard and morose from carrying his guilty secret, of his confusion when confronted with the supposed knowledge of it. The old Southern city was described, and the opinions of its residents in regard to the case given.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	46477	46458	46508	Skaggs	One could see it all as if every phase of it were being enacted before one's eyes. [MASK] surpassed himself. When the editor first got hold of it he said "Huh!" over the opening lines,--a few short sentences that instantly pricked the attention awake.
TheSportOfTheGods	56	46686	46644	46700	Skaggs	It never lost an opportunity to crow, and if one was not forthcoming, it made one. In this way it managed to do a considerable amount of good, and its yellowness became forgivable, even commendable. In [MASK]'s story the editor saw an opportunity for one of its periodical philanthropies.
TheSportOfTheGods	44	47353	47329	47373	Skaggs	But there were some in the town who thought differently about the matter, and it was their opinions and murmurings that backed up [MASK] and made it easier for him when at the capital he came into contact with the official red tape.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	47879	47874	47924	Skaggs	What fu'?" [MASK] did not tell him that, now that the _Universe_ had done its work, it demanded the right to crow to its heart's satisfaction. He said only, "You want to see your wife, of course?"
TheSportOfTheGods	50	47991	47980	48030	Skaggs	"They 're all right," was the reply. [MASK] could n't tell him, in this the first hour of his freedom. Let him have time to drink the sweetness of that all in. There would be time afterwards to taste all of the bitterness.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	48336	48317	48366	Berry	The news the papers held had not escaped her, but she had suffered in silence, hoping that [MASK] might be spared the pain of finding her. Now he stood before her, and she knew him at a glance, in spite of his haggard countenance.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	48368	48367	48416	Fannie	"[MASK]," he said, holding out his arms to her, and all of the pain and pathos of long yearning was in his voice, "don't you know me?" She shrank away from him, back in the hall-way.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	48464	48455	48505	Fannie	This was not the reception he had expected from [MASK]. When they were within the room he turned and held out his arms to her again, but she did not notice them. "Why, is you 'shamed o' me?" he asked brokenly.
TheSportOfTheGods	51	48540	48490	48541	Fannie	"Why, is you 'shamed o' me?" he asked brokenly. "'Shamed? No! Oh, Be'y," and she sank into a chair and began rocking to and fro in her helpless grief. "What 's de mattah, [MASK]?
TheSportOfTheGods	51	48648	48648	48699	Berry	[MASK] started forward with a cry, "My Gawd! my Gawd! my little gal! my boy!" "Dat ain't all," she went on dully, as if reciting a rote lesson; "I ain't yo' wife no mo'.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	48727	48724	48774	Joe	Kit an' [MASK] lef' me, an' dey said de pen'tentiary divo'ced you an' me, an' dat you 'd nevah come out nohow. Don't look at me lak dat, Be'y." "You ain't my wife no mo'?
TheSportOfTheGods	52	49101	49073	49125	Fannie	"Ag'in!" She hung her head: "Yes." He gripped himself hard. "Why cain't you come on off wid me, [MASK]? You was mine fus'." "I could n't. He would fin' me anywhaih I went to."
TheSportOfTheGods	53	49196	49172	49225	Berry	"Please go now, Be'y, befo' he gits home. He 's mad anyhow, 'cause you 're out." [MASK] looked at her hard, and then said in a dry voice, "An' so I got to go an' leave you to him?"
TheSportOfTheGods	46	49297	49267	49313	Fannie	an' then I--I--ust to pray to Gawd an' call him 'Ouah Fathah.'" He laughed hoarsely. It sounded like nothing [MASK] had ever heard before. "Don't, Be'y, don't say dat.
TheSportOfTheGods	49	49815	49797	49846	Fannie	He staggered back. "Oh, my Gawd!" he said. There was crape on [MASK]'s bell. His head went round and he held to the door for support. Then he turned the knob and the door opened. He went noiselessly in.
TheSportOfTheGods	50	49851	49847	49897	Fannie	At the door of [MASK]'s room he halted, sick with fear. He knocked, a step sounded within, and his wife's face looked out upon him. He could have screamed aloud with relief. "It ain't you!" he whispered huskily.
