Persuasion	52	3461	3432	3484	Elizabeth	They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt. But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and [MASK]. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations, and she did what nobody else thought of doing:
Persuasion	48	8608	8600	8648	Elizabeth	Nothing could be done without a reference to [MASK]: but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal, that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.
Persuasion	41	8830	8804	8845	Anne	He was, at that time, a remarkably fine young man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and [MASK] an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling.
Persuasion	54	12399	12362	12416	Anne	However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me." [MASK] had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of doing good.
Persuasion	57	12876	12839	12896	Mary	The two families were so continually meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find [MASK] alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course.
Persuasion	50	13107	13058	13108	Anne	So, you are come at last! I began to think I should never see you. I am so ill I can hardly speak. I have not seen a creature the whole morning!" "I am sorry to find you unwell," replied [MASK].
Persuasion	51	13529	13485	13536	Anne	"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone. It is early." "I never want them, I assure you. They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me. Oh! [MASK], I am so very unwell!
Persuasion	50	18274	18225	18275	Richard	"And I will tell you our reason," she added, "and all about it. I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor [MASK]!
Persuasion	46	20436	20401	20447	Anne	Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all. You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use. [MASK] will send for me if anything is the matter."
Persuasion	54	20510	20489	20543	Anne	She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon as there was only [MASK] to hear-- "So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!
Persuasion	48	21453	21447	21495	Anne	"This is very kind of [MASK]," was her husband's answer, "and I should be very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child."
Persuasion	55	21920	21920	21975	Anne	[MASK] understood it. He wished to avoid seeing her. He had inquired after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.
Persuasion	42	22313	22284	22326	Mary	"It is over! it is over!" she repeated to herself again and again, in nervous gratitude. "The worst is over!" [MASK] talked, but she could not attend. She had seen him.
Persuasion	51	26070	26026	26077	Frederick	"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable." "I might not like them the better for that perhaps. Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board." "My dear [MASK], you are talking quite idly.
Persuasion	52	26833	26822	26874	Anne	The evening ended with dancing. On its being proposed, [MASK] offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad to be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.
Persuasion	41	32238	32238	32279	Charles	[MASK], in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently, though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.
Persuasion	51	32523	32478	32529	Anne	But, I assure you, I have never been in the house above twice in my life." She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile, followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which [MASK] perfectly knew the meaning of.
Persuasion	49	32663	32650	32699	Anne	She turned through the same gate, but could not see them. [MASK] found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.
Persuasion	45	33426	33425	33470	Mary	"[MASK] is good-natured enough in many respects," said she; "but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride--the Elliot pride. She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.
Persuasion	47	33727	33718	33765	Mary	As soon as she could, she went after [MASK], and having found, and walked back with her to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once more in motion together.
Persuasion	45	33976	33934	33979	Anne	In a long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, [MASK] necessarily belonged.
Persuasion	55	39120	39120	39175	Anne	[MASK] smiled more than once to herself during this speech, and entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good of a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?
Persuasion	53	40441	40390	40443	Elliot	I wish I had looked at him more. I wish we had been aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us. What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other! Do you think he had the [MASK] countenance?
Persuasion	54	41399	41399	41453	Anne	[MASK] did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed able to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject, and when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.
Persuasion	44	43663	43637	43681	Louisa	She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently. The usefulness of her staying! She who had not been able to remain in [MASK]'s room, or to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!
Persuasion	55	44828	44828	44883	Anne	[MASK] wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions and limits.
Persuasion	47	44917	44884	44931	Anne	She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character. They got on fast. [MASK] was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon.
Persuasion	51	46008	45970	46021	Uppercross	She was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, she was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses, of all that had given [MASK] its cheerful character. A few days had made a change indeed!
Persuasion	57	50221	50217	50274	Louisa	He had not seen [MASK]; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days, till her head was stronger.
Persuasion	54	57137	57132	57186	Anne	"Yes," sighed [MASK], "we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!" then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added, "I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance.
Persuasion	42	57301	57296	57338	Anne	"Well," said [MASK], "I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place." "I love your indignation," said he; "it is very natural.
Persuasion	53	60540	60530	60583	Anne	She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain [MASK] in time as of his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.
Persuasion	53	60589	60584	60637	Anne	She would not speak to [MASK] with half the certainty she felt on the subject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.
Persuasion	45	60934	60934	60979	Anne	[MASK] was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table, and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings this picture excited. For a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched.
Persuasion	47	63510	63501	63548	Louisa	Perhaps he had quitted the field, had given [MASK] up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her. She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend.
Persuasion	47	66146	66106	66153	Anne	I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man." "Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end." [MASK] looked down to hide her smile.
Persuasion	57	66307	66277	66334	Benwick	"Yes, yes, I understand you. But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter. He does not give the least fling at [MASK]; does not so much as say, 'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for wondering at it.'
Persuasion	54	67434	67393	67447	Louisa	They had by dint of being so very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now. Time had changed him, or [MASK] had changed him. There was consciousness of some sort or other.
Persuasion	59	71589	71589	71648	Anne	[MASK]'s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening; it was just occupation enough: she had feelings for the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least during the first act.
Persuasion	46	72092	72062	72108	Anne	No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery. To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible; and [MASK] was all curiosity. She wondered, and questioned him eagerly; but in vain.
Persuasion	46	73223	73181	73227	Anne	They talked for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down towards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged [MASK] to turn round.
Persuasion	58	74376	74321	74379	Anne	"Yes, I do. Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world, the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together." A blush overspread [MASK]'s cheeks.
Persuasion	54	78087	78050	78104	Anne	I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet." [MASK], seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.
Persuasion	58	78496	78439	78497	Elliot	The baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he is quite fool enough. If he does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion. He is worse than last year." "I wish I had any name but [MASK].
Persuasion	58	78625	78585	78643	Anne	Though I have forgot the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning. But it shows you the man. Mark his professions to my poor husband. Can any thing be stronger?" [MASK] could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father.
Persuasion	42	82529	82529	82571	Anne	[MASK] admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object.
Persuasion	52	87686	87686	87738	Anne	[MASK] felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same. The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.
Persuasion	51	88141	88127	88178	Anne	You see he cannot put the card out of his hand." [MASK] caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.
Persuasion	58	90917	90870	90928	Anne	"Not quite, a few lines more. I shall have done in five minutes." "There is no hurry on my side. I am only ready whenever you are. I am in very good anchorage here," (smiling at [MASK],) "well supplied, and want for nothing.
Persuasion	42	97284	97282	97324	Anne	She loved [MASK] better than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.
Persuasion	47	97425	97408	97455	Anne	She had something to suffer, perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing [MASK] restored to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.
