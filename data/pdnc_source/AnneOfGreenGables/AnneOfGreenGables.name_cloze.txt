AnneOfGreenGables	44	680	679	723	Matthew	But [MASK] so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	1105	1105	1151	Trees	[MASK] aren't much company, though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them. I'd ruther look at people. To be sure, they seem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they're used to it.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	2078	2025	2080	Marilla	"What on earth put such a notion into your head?" she demanded disapprovingly. This had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be disapproved. "Well, we've been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact," returned [MASK]. "
AnneOfGreenGables	48	2150	2150	2198	Matthew	[MASK] is getting up in years, you know--he's sixty--and he isn't so spry as he once was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	2247	2199	2253	Matthew	There's never anybody to be had but those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the lobster canneries or the States. At first [MASK] suggested getting a Home boy.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	2526	2523	2572	Marilla	"Well, [MASK], I'll just tell you plain that I think you're doing a mighty foolish thing--a risky thing, that's what. You don't know what you're getting. You're bringing a strange child into your house and home
AnneOfGreenGables	54	2789	2775	2829	Matthew	I could see that, so I gave in. It's so seldom [MASK] sets his mind on anything that when he does I always feel it's my duty to give in. And as for the risk, there's risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	2988	2976	3023	Marilla	"Well, we're not getting a girl," said [MASK], as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy. "I'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	3700	3671	3723	Matthew	The long platform was almost deserted; the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end. [MASK], barely noting that it _was_ a girl, sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	3780	3780	3831	Matthew	[MASK] encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper, and asked him if the five-thirty train would soon be along. "The five-thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago," answered that brisk official.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	3912	3881	3929	Matthew	There was more scope for imagination,' she said. She's a case, I should say." "I'm not expecting a girl," said [MASK] blankly. "It's a boy I've come for. He should be here.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	4108	4097	4151	Matthew	He walked jauntily away, being hungry, and the unfortunate [MASK] was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den--walk up to a girl--a strange girl--an orphan girl--and demand of her why she wasn't a boy.
AnneOfGreenGables	56	4620	4583	4639	Matthew	You could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn't you? And I was quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didn't to-night." [MASK] had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his; then and there he decided what to do.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	5143	5114	5164	Matthew	There isn't a pick on my bones. I do love to imagine I'm nice and plump, with dimples in my elbows." With this [MASK]'s companion stopped talking, partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	5287	5274	5324	Matthew	" she asked. "Well now, I dunno," said [MASK]. "Why, a bride, of course--a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil. I've never seen one, but I can imagine what she would look like.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	5911	5891	5943	Matthew	And what _does_ make the roads red?" "Well now, I dunno," said [MASK]. "Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime. Isn't it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about?
AnneOfGreenGables	47	6041	6005	6052	Matthew	Would you rather I didn't talk? If you say so I'll stop. I can _stop_ when I make up my mind to it, although it's difficult." [MASK], much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	6326	6284	6327	Matthew	And people laugh at me because I use big words. But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven't you?" "Well now, that seems reasonable," said [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	49	6676	6630	6679	Matthew	But just now I feel pretty nearly perfectly happy. I can't feel exactly perfectly happy because--well, what color would you call this?" She twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and held it up before [MASK]'s eyes.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	6951	6908	6959	Matthew	Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow. What is an alabaster brow? I never could find out. Can you tell me?" "Well now, I'm afraid I can't," said [MASK], who was getting a little dizzy.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	7033	6988	7035	Matthew	"Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was divinely beautiful. Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be divinely beautiful?" "Well now, no, I haven't," confessed [MASK] ingenuously.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	7422	7394	7444	Matthew	She could keep silence, it was evident, as energetically as she could talk. "I guess you're feeling pretty tired and hungry," [MASK] ventured to say at last, accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the only reason he could think of.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	7530	7518	7570	Matthew	"Well now, you must mean the Avenue," said [MASK] after a few moments' profound reflection. "It is a kind of pretty place." "Pretty? Oh, _pretty_ doesn't seem the right word to use. Nor beautiful, either.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	8190	8149	8198	Matthew	Yes, that is the right name for it. I know because of the thrill. When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives me a thrill. Do things ever give you a thrill?" [MASK] ruminated. "Well now, yes.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	8279	8229	8283	Barry	"Oh, I don't think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill. Do you think it can? There doesn't seem to be much connection between grubs and lakes of shining waters, does there? But why do other people call it [MASK]'s pond?"
AnneOfGreenGables	51	8380	8369	8420	Diana	"He's got one about eleven. Her name is [MASK]." "Oh!" with a long indrawing of breath. "What a perfectly lovely name!" "Well now, I dunno. There's something dreadful heathenish about it, seems to me.
AnneOfGreenGables	58	8679	8631	8689	Matthew	I always say good night to the things I love, just as I would to people. I think they like it. That water looks as if it was smiling at me." When they had driven up the further hill and around a corner [MASK] said: "We're pretty near home now.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	8897	8857	8907	Matthew	Over it, in the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining like a lamp of guidance and promise. "That's it, isn't it?" she said, pointing. [MASK] slapped the reins on the sorrel's back delightedly.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	9454	9435	9485	Matthew	she ejaculated. "Where is the boy?" "There wasn't any boy," said [MASK] wretchedly. "There was only _her_." He nodded at the child, remembering that he had never even asked her name. "No boy!
AnneOfGreenGables	42	9498	9457	9499	Marilla	"There was only _her_." He nodded at the child, remembering that he had never even asked her name. "No boy! But there _must_ have been a boy," insisted [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	59	9571	9513	9572	Marilla	"Well, she didn't. She brought _her_. I asked the station-master. And I had to bring her home. She couldn't be left there, no matter where the mistake had come in." "Well, this is a pretty piece of business!" ejaculated [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	43	9762	9751	9794	Marilla	Neither of them knew what to say or do. Finally [MASK] stepped lamely into the breach. "Well, well, there's no need to cry so about it." "Yes, there _is_ need!"
AnneOfGreenGables	54	9884	9871	9925	Marilla	Something like a reluctant smile, rather rusty from long disuse, mellowed [MASK]'s grim expression. "Well, don't cry any more. We're not going to turn you out-of-doors to-night. You'll have to stay here until we investigate this affair.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	9945	9898	9947	Cordelia	We're not going to turn you out-of-doors to-night. You'll have to stay here until we investigate this affair. What's your name?" The child hesitated for a moment. "Will you please call me [MASK]?"
AnneOfGreenGables	48	9986	9959	10007	Cordelia	Is that your name?" "No-o-o, it's not exactly my name, but I would love to be called [MASK]. It's such a perfectly elegant name." "I don't know what on earth you mean.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	10415	10387	10437	Matthew	You don't know how delighted I was. I couldn't sleep all last night for joy. Oh," she added reproachfully, turning to [MASK], "why didn't you tell me at the station that you didn't want me and leave me there?
AnneOfGreenGables	45	10592	10566	10611	Matthew	If I was very beautiful and had nut-brown hair would you keep me?" "No. We want a boy to help [MASK] on the farm. A girl would be of no use to us. Take off your hat.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	10644	10643	10686	Anne	But [MASK] could not eat. In vain she nibbled at the bread and butter and pecked at the crab-apple preserve out of the little scalloped glass dish by her plate. She did not really make any headway at all.
AnneOfGreenGables	59	10696	10649	10708	Marilla	In vain she nibbled at the bread and butter and pecked at the crab-apple preserve out of the little scalloped glass dish by her plate. She did not really make any headway at all. "You're not eating anything," said [MASK] sharply, eying her as if it were a serious shortcoming.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	10757	10712	10763	Marilla	"I can't. I'm in the depths of despair. Can you eat when you are in the depths of despair?" "I've never been in the depths of despair, so I can't say," responded [MASK]. "Weren't you?
AnneOfGreenGables	48	10922	10886	10934	Matthew	I do hope you won't be offended because I can't eat. Everything is extremely nice, but still I cannot eat." "I guess she's tired," said [MASK], who hadn't spoken since his return from the barn.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	11071	11051	11102	Marilla	The hall was fearsomely clean; the little gable chamber in which she presently found herself seemed still cleaner. [MASK] set the candle on a three-legged, three-cornered table and turned down the bedclothes. "I suppose you have a nightgown?" she questioned.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	11103	11103	11153	Anne	[MASK] nodded. "Yes, I have two. The matron of the asylum made them for me. They're fearfully skimpy. There is never enough to go around in an asylum, so things are always skimpy--at least in a poor asylum like ours.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	11283	11265	11312	Anne	The floor was bare, too, except for a round braided mat in the middle such as [MASK] had never seen before. In one corner was the bed, a high, old-fashioned one, with four dark, low-turned posts.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	11409	11358	11412	Anne	Midway between table and bed was the window, with an icy white muslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand. The whole apartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words, but which sent a shiver to the very marrow of [MASK]'s bones.
AnneOfGreenGables	57	11531	11515	11572	Anne	"Good night," she said, a little awkwardly, but not unkindly. [MASK]'s white face and big eyes appeared over the bedclothes with a startling suddenness. "How can you call it a _good_ night when you know it must be the very worst night I've ever had?
AnneOfGreenGables	53	11586	11547	11600	Marilla	"How can you call it a _good_ night when you know it must be the very worst night I've ever had?" she said reproachfully. Then she dived down into invisibility again. [MASK] went slowly down to the kitchen and proceeded to wash the supper dishes.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	11769	11743	11790	Marilla	"You _suppose_ so! Don't you know it?" "Well now, she's a real nice little thing, [MASK]. It's kind of a pity to send her back when she's so set on staying here."
AnneOfGreenGables	47	11846	11830	11877	Matthew	"Well, now, no, I suppose not--not exactly," stammered [MASK], uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning. "I suppose--we could hardly be expected to keep her." "I should say not.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	11898	11858	11902	Matthew	"I suppose--we could hardly be expected to keep her." "I should say not. What good would she be to us?" "We might be some good to her," said [MASK] suddenly and unexpectedly.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	11944	11915	11967	Matthew	I can see as plain as plain that you want to keep her." "Well now, she's a real interesting little thing," persisted [MASK]. "You should have heard her talk coming from the station." "Oh, she can talk fast enough.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	12058	12016	12069	Matthew	There's something I don't understand about her. No, she's got to be despatched straight-way back to where she came from." "I could hire a French boy to help me," said [MASK], "and she'd be company for you."
AnneOfGreenGables	45	12146	12133	12178	Marilla	And to bed, when she had put her dishes away, went [MASK], frowning most resolutely. And up-stairs, in the east gable, a lonely, heart-hungry, friendless child cried herself to sleep. CHAPTER IV.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	12625	12595	12640	Anne	Off to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over green, low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea. [MASK]'s beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily in.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	12715	12702	12743	Marilla	"It's time you were dressed," she said curtly. [MASK] really did not know how to talk to the child, and her uncomfortable ignorance made her crisp and curt when she did not mean to be.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	12784	12753	12806	Marilla	"Oh, isn't it wonderful?" she said, waving her hand comprehensively at the good world outside. "It's a big tree," said [MASK], "and it blooms great, but the fruit don't amount to much never--small and wormy."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	13114	13074	13125	Marilla	But the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts." "You'd better get dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your imaginings," said [MASK] as soon as she could get a word in edgewise.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	13249	13232	13279	Marilla	"I'm pretty hungry this morning," she announced as she slipped into the chair [MASK] placed for her. "The world doesn't seem such a howling wilderness as it did last night. I'm so glad it's a sunshiny morning.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	13409	13363	13410	Marilla	It's all very well to read about sorrows and imagine yourself living through them heroically, but it's not so nice when you really come to have them, is it?" "For pity's sake hold your tongue," said [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	54	13499	13497	13551	Marilla	This made [MASK] more nervous than ever; she had an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child's body might be there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy cloudland, borne aloft on the wings of imagination. Who would want such a child about the place?
AnneOfGreenGables	42	13593	13591	13633	Matthew	That was [MASK]'s way--take a whim into his head and cling to it with the most amazing silent persistency--a persistency ten times more potent and effectual in its very silence than if he had talked it out.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	13661	13652	13703	Marilla	"Can you wash dishes right?" asked [MASK] distrustfully. "Pretty well. I'm better at looking after children, though. I've had so much experience at that. It's such a pity you haven't any here for me to look after."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	13748	13704	13755	Matthew	"I don't feel as if I wanted any more children to look after than I've got at present. _You're_ problem enough in all conscience. What's to be done with you I don't know. [MASK] is a most ridiculous man."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	13765	13756	13806	Anne	"I think he's lovely," said [MASK] reproachfully. "He is so very sympathetic. He didn't mind how much I talked--he seemed to like it. I felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	13826	13790	13839	Marilla	I felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him." "You're both queer enough, if that's what you mean by kindred spirits," said [MASK] with a sniff. "Yes, you may wash the dishes.
AnneOfGreenGables	58	13968	13934	13992	Marilla	Later on she made her bed less successfully, for she had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick. But is was done somehow and smoothed down; and then [MASK], to get rid of her, told her she might go out-of-doors and amuse herself until dinner time.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	13993	13993	14042	Anne	[MASK] flew to the door, face alight, eyes glowing. On the very threshold she stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table, light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an extinguisher on her.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	14052	14005	14053	Marilla	On the very threshold she stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table, light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an extinguisher on her. "What's the matter now?" demanded [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	52	14460	14409	14461	Bonny	It makes them seem more like people. How do you know but that it hurts a geranium's feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else? You wouldn't like to be called nothing but a woman all the time. Yes, I shall call it [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	52	14527	14486	14538	Marilla	Of course, it won't always be in blossom, but one can imagine that it is, can't one?" "I never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her," muttered [MASK], beating a retreat down to the cellar after potatoes.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	14581	14565	14615	Matthew	She'll be casting a spell over me, too. She's cast it over [MASK]. That look he gave me when he went out said everything he said or hinted last night over again. I wish he was like other men and would talk things out.
AnneOfGreenGables	59	15167	15126	15185	Marilla	Did you ever know of anybody whose hair was red when she was young, but got to be another color when she grew up?" "No, I don't know as I ever did," said [MASK] mercilessly, "and I shouldn't think it likely to happen in your case either."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	15186	15186	15236	Anne	[MASK] sighed. "Well, that is another hope gone. ?My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.' That's a sentence I read in a book once, and I say it over to comfort myself whenever I'm disappointed in anything."
AnneOfGreenGables	53	15251	15199	15252	Marilla	My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.' That's a sentence I read in a book once, and I say it over to comfort myself whenever I'm disappointed in anything." "I don't see where the comforting comes in myself," said [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	51	15367	15350	15401	Anne	We're going by the shore road." "Shore road sounds nice," said [MASK] dreamily. "Is it as nice as it sounds? Just when you said ?shore road' I saw it in a picture in my mind, as quick as that!
AnneOfGreenGables	52	15494	15444	15496	Anne	"It's five miles; and as you're evidently bent on talking you might as well talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about yourself." "Oh, what I _know_ about myself isn't really worth telling," said [MASK] eagerly.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	15568	15524	15579	Anne	"No, I don't want any of your imaginings. Just you stick to bald facts. Begin at the beginning. Where were you born and how old are you?" "I was eleven last March," said [MASK], resigning herself to bald facts with a little sigh.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	15680	15658	15701	Marilla	"I guess it doesn't matter what a person's name is as long as he behaves himself," said [MASK], feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good and useful moral. "Well, I don't know.
AnneOfGreenGables	56	15703	15702	15758	Anne	" [MASK] looked thoughtful. "I read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I've never been able to believe it. I don't believe a rose _would_ be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	15775	15736	15787	Jedediah	I don't believe a rose _would_ be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage. I suppose my father could have been a good man even if he had been called [MASK]; but I'm sure it would have been a cross.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	16585	16557	16601	Marilla	Evidently she did not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not wanted her. "Did you ever go to school?" demanded [MASK], turning the sorrel mare down the shore road. "Not a great deal.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	16830	16819	16869	Anne	"O-o-o-h," faltered [MASK]. Her sensitive little face suddenly flushed scarlet and embarrassment sat on her brow. "Oh, they _meant_ to be--I know they meant to be just as good and kind as possible.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	16952	16906	16957	Marilla	It's a very trying to have a drunken husband, you see; and it must be very trying to have twins three times in succession, don't you think? But I feel sure they meant to be good to me." [MASK] asked no more questions.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	17101	17090	17139	Marilla	"She's got too much to say," thought [MASK], "but she might be trained out of that. And there's nothing rude or slangy in what she does say. She's ladylike. It's likely her people were nice folks."
AnneOfGreenGables	44	17618	17576	17620	Anne	"Dear, dear," she exclaimed, "you're the last folks I was looking for today, but I'm real glad to see you. You'll put your horse in? And how are you, [MASK]?"
AnneOfGreenGables	50	17884	17862	17912	Marilla	I've often had to scold her well for her heedlessness." "It was our own fault," said [MASK] resignedly. "We should have come to you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by word of mouth in that fashion.
AnneOfGreenGables	57	18622	18621	18678	Humph	"[MASK]! You don't look as if there was much to you. But you're wiry. I don't know but the wiry ones are the best after all. Well, if I take you you'll have to be a good girl, you know--good and smart and respectful.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	18864	18833	18876	Matthew	No, she could not take the responsibility of doing that! "Well, I don't know," she said slowly. "I didn't say that [MASK] and I had absolutely decided that we wouldn't keep her.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	18917	18903	18954	Matthew	I think I'd better take her home again and talk it over with [MASK]. I feel that I oughtn't to decide on anything without consulting him. If we make up our mind not to keep her we'll bring or send her over to you tomorrow night.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	19230	19201	19244	Anne	She certainly needs you much more than I do." "I'd rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her," said [MASK] passionately. "She looks exactly like a--like a gimlet."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	19328	19286	19335	Anne	"Go back and sit down quietly and hold your tongue and behave as a good girl should." "I'll try to do and be anything you want me, if you'll only keep me," said [MASK], returning meekly to her ottoman.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	19387	19366	19419	Anne	She was prepared for the relief she read in his face when he saw that she had at least brought back [MASK] back with her. But she said nothing, to him, relative to the affair, until they were both out in the yard behind the barn milking the cows.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	19566	19520	19572	Matthew	It seems a sort of duty. I've never brought up a child, especially a girl, and I dare say I'll make a terrible mess of it. But I'll do my best. So far as I'm concerned, [MASK], she may stay."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	19636	19605	19654	Marilla	"She's such an interesting little thing." "It'd be more to the point if you could say she was a useful little thing," retorted [MASK], "but I'll make it my business to see she's trained to be that.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	19658	19655	19703	Matthew	And mind, [MASK], you're not to go interfering with my methods. Perhaps an old maid doesn't know much about bringing up a child, but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor. So you just leave me to manage her.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	19882	19853	19904	Matthew	Did you ever suppose you'd see the day when you'd be adopting an orphan girl? It's surprising enough; but not so surprising as that [MASK] should be at the bottom of it, him that always seemed to have such a mortal dread of little girls.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	20044	20004	20053	Anne	I haven't any use at all for little girls who aren't neat." "I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn't think about my clothes at all," said [MASK]. "I'll fold them nicely tonight.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	20109	20064	20110	Marilla	Half the time, though, I'd forget, I'd be in such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things." "You'll have to remember a little better if you stay here," admonished [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	47	20223	20223	20270	Marilla	[MASK] looked rather relieved. "So you do know something then, thank goodness! You're not quite a heathen. Where did you learn that?" "Oh, at the asylum Sunday-school. They made us learn the whole catechism.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	20347	20339	20386	Anne	"We're not talking about poetry, [MASK]--we are talking about saying your prayers. Don't you know it's a terrible wicked thing not to say your prayers every night? I'm afraid you are a very bad little girl."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	20406	20357	20408	Anne	Don't you know it's a terrible wicked thing not to say your prayers every night? I'm afraid you are a very bad little girl." "You'd find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair," said [MASK] reproachfully.
AnneOfGreenGables	56	20540	20526	20582	Anne	"Why, of course, if you want me to," assented [MASK] cheerfully. "I'd do anything to oblige you. But you'll have to tell me what to say for this once. After I get into bed I'll imagine out a real nice prayer to say always.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	21161	21130	21180	Anne	She tucked the child up in bed, mentally vowing that she should be taught a prayer the very next day, and was leaving the room with the light when [MASK] called her back. "I've just thought of it now. I should have said, ?
AnneOfGreenGables	48	21246	21199	21247	Marilla	I'd forgotten it, but I felt a prayer should be finished off in some way, so I put in the other. Do you suppose it will make any difference?" "I--I don't suppose it will," said [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	57	21713	21658	21715	Marilla	I've tried to be patient all the morning, but I really feel that I cannot bear not knowing any longer. It's a dreadful feeling. Please tell me." "You haven't scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to do," said [MASK] immovably.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	21827	21810	21862	Anne	Why, child, whatever is the matter?" "I'm crying," said [MASK] in a tone of bewilderment. "I can't think why. I'm glad as glad can be. Oh, _glad_ doesn't seem the right word at all.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	21956	21920	21970	Marilla	However, I'll do my very best. But can you tell me why I'm crying?" "I suppose it's because you're all excited and worked up," said [MASK] disapprovingly. "Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	22041	21999	22043	Anne	You must go to school; but it's only a fortnight till vacation so it isn't worth while for you to start before it opens again in September." "What am I to call you?" asked [MASK]. "
AnneOfGreenGables	45	22244	22201	22246	Marilla	"No. I'm not your aunt and I don't believe in calling people names that don't belong to them." "But we could imagine you were my aunt." "I couldn't," said [MASK] grimly.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	22311	22294	22337	Marilla	"I don't believe in imagining things different from what they really are," retorted [MASK]. "When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances He doesn't mean for us to imagine them away. And that reminds me.
AnneOfGreenGables	57	22344	22338	22395	Anne	Go into the sitting room, [MASK]--be sure your feet are clean and don't let any flies in--and bring me out the illustrated card that's on the mantelpiece. The Lord's Prayer is on it and you'll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	22422	22373	22425	Anne	The Lord's Prayer is on it and you'll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart. There's to be no more of such praying as I heard last night." "I suppose I was very awkward," said [MASK] apologetically, "
AnneOfGreenGables	50	22560	22511	22561	Anne	And I'm afraid I'll never be able to think out another one as good. Somehow, things never are so good when they're thought out a second time. Have you ever noticed that?" "Here is something for you to notice, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	51	22637	22635	22686	Anne	She found [MASK] standing motionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two windows, with her eyes a-star with dreams. The white and green light strained through apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt little figure with a half-unearthly radiance.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	23021	23021	23072	Anne	[MASK]'s eyes marveled. "Why, I felt just as reverent as could be. I'm sure I didn't mean to be irreverent." "Well I don't suppose you did--but it doesn't sound right to talk so familiarly about such things.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	23077	23050	23101	Anne	"Well I don't suppose you did--but it doesn't sound right to talk so familiarly about such things. And another thing, [MASK], when I send you after something you're to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and imagining before pictures.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	23565	23562	23605	Diana	"What is [MASK] like? Her hair isn't red, is it? Oh, I hope not. It's bad enough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn't endure it in a bosom friend."
AnneOfGreenGables	47	23607	23577	23624	Diana	Oh, I hope not. It's bad enough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn't endure it in a bosom friend." "[MASK] is a very pretty little girl. She has black eyes and hair and rosy cheeks.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	23676	23675	23727	Anne	But [MASK] waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the delightful possibilities before it. "Oh, I'm so glad she's pretty. Next to being beautiful oneself--and that's impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom friend.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	24159	24111	24161	Marilla	I had become so attached to her that I hadn't the heart to imagine a bosom friend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination there." "I think it's just as well there wasn't," said [MASK] drily.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	24344	24296	24345	Marilla	Fancy going to sleep in it when the wind was rocking it. If I wasn't a human girl I think I'd like to be a bee and live among the flowers." "Yesterday you wanted to be a sea gull," sniffed [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	54	24467	24428	24482	Anne	Go to your room and finish learning it well, and stay there until I call you down to help me get tea." "Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?" pleaded [MASK]. "No; you don't want your room cluttered up with flowers.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	24510	24497	24549	Anne	"I did feel a little that way, too," said [MASK]. "I kind of felt I shouldn't shorten their lovely lives by picking them--I wouldn't want to be picked if I were an apple blossom. But the temptation was _irresistible_.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	24579	24579	24631	Anne	[MASK] sighed, retreated to the east gable, and sat down in a chair by the window. "There--I know this prayer. I learned that last sentence coming upstairs. Now I'm going to imagine things into this room so that they'll always stay imagined.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	24937	24912	24957	Diana	And good afternoon dear birches down in the hollow. And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill. I wonder if [MASK] is to be my bosom friend. I hope she will, and I shall love her very much.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	25016	25000	25051	Anne	I must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every day." [MASK] blew a couple of airy kisses from her fingertips past the cherry blossoms and then, with her chin in her hands, drifted luxuriously out on a sea of daydreams. CHAPTER IX.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	25686	25665	25717	Matthew	Couldn't you have sent her back?" "I suppose we could, but we decided not to. [MASK] took a fancy to her. And I must say I like her myself--although I admit she has her faults. The house seems a different place already.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	25821	25780	25823	Marilla	You don't know much about her or her real disposition, I suppose, and there's no guessing how a child like that will turn out. But I don't want to discourage you I'm sure, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	46	25870	25863	25909	Anne	I'll call her in." [MASK] came running in presently, her face sparkling with the delight of her orchard rovings; but, abashed at finding the delight herself in the unexpected presence of a stranger, she halted confusedly inside the door.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	26031	26023	26073	Marilla	"She's terrible skinny and homely, [MASK]. Come here, child, and let me have a look at you. Lawful heart, did any one ever see such freckles? And hair as red as carrots! Come here, child, I say."
AnneOfGreenGables	57	26385	26385	26442	Anne	[MASK], bursting into tears, rushed to the hall door, slammed it until the tins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy, and fled through the hall and up the stairs like a whirlwind. A subdued slam above told that the door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	26551	26546	26597	Marilla	"No," said [MASK] slowly, "I'm not trying to excuse her. She's been very naughty and I'll have to give her a talking to about it. But we must make allowances for her. She's never been taught what is right.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	26608	26563	26610	Rachel	She's been very naughty and I'll have to give her a talking to about it. But we must make allowances for her. She's never been taught what is right. And you _were_ too hard on her, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	54	26662	26643	26697	Marilla	"Well, I see that I'll have to be very careful what I say after this, [MASK], since the fine feelings of orphans, brought from goodness knows where, have to be considered before anything else. Oh, no, I'm not vexed--don't worry yourself.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	26800	26795	26843	Marilla	Well, good evening, [MASK]. I hope you'll come down to see me often as usual. But you can't expect me to visit here again in a hurry, if I'm liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	27292	27269	27317	Anne	"Oh, but there's such a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it," wailed [MASK]. "You may know a thing is so, but you can't help hoping other people don't quite think it is.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	27447	27440	27482	Marilla	An old remembrance suddenly rose up before [MASK]. She had been a very small child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another, "What a pity she is such a dark, homely little thing."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	27483	27449	27498	Marilla	She had been a very small child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another, "What a pity she is such a dark, homely little thing." [MASK] was every day of fifty before the sting had gone out of that memory.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	27531	27530	27573	Rachel	"[MASK] is too outspoken. But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part. She was a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor--all three very good reasons why you should have been respectful to her.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	27618	27574	27622	Anne	You were rude and saucy and"--Marilla had a saving inspiration of punishment--"you must go to her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her to forgive you." "I can never do that," said [MASK] determinedly and darkly.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	27634	27623	27665	Marilla	"You can punish me in any way you like, [MASK]. You can shut me up in a dark, damp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and water and I shall not complain.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	27854	27811	27859	Marilla	I can't say I'm sorry when I'm not, can I? I can't even _imagine_ I'm sorry." "Perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the morning," said [MASK], rising to depart.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	28126	28096	28139	Matthew	I suppose you'll be saying next thing that she oughtn't to be punished at all!" "Well now--no--not exactly," said [MASK] uneasily. "I reckon she ought to be punished a little.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	28149	28129	28178	Marilla	"I reckon she ought to be punished a little. But don't be too hard on her, [MASK]. Recollect she hasn't ever had anyone to teach her right. You're--you're going to give her something to eat, aren't you?"
AnneOfGreenGables	52	28195	28163	28215	Marilla	You're--you're going to give her something to eat, aren't you?" "When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?" demanded [MASK] indignantly. "She'll have her meals regular, and I'll carry them up to her myself.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	28510	28510	28552	Anne	[MASK] smiled wanly. "Pretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of course, it's rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to that."
AnneOfGreenGables	53	28553	28514	28567	Anne	"Pretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of course, it's rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to that." [MASK] smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary imprisonment before her.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	28717	28693	28739	Anne	That's what I was trying to get at." "I suppose I could do it to oblige you," said [MASK] thoughtfully. "It would be true enough to say I am sorry, because I _am_ sorry now.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	28903	28850	28905	Anne	But still--I'd do anything for you--if you really want me to--" "Well now, of course I do. It's terrible lonesome downstairs without you. Just go and smooth things over--that's a good girl." "Very well," said [MASK] resignedly.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	28975	28944	28991	Anne	She might think I was putting my oar in and I promised not to do that." "Wild horses won't drag the secret from me," promised [MASK] solemnly. "How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?"
AnneOfGreenGables	46	29698	29694	29740	Anne	She only perceived that [MASK] had made a very thorough apology and all resentment vanished from her kindly, if somewhat officious, heart. "There, there, get up, child," she said heartily. "Of course I forgive you.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	29852	29851	29903	Anne	" [MASK] drew a long breath as she rose to her feet. "You have given me a hope. I shall always feel that you are a benefactor. Oh, I could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome auburn when I grew up.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	29949	29904	29952	Marilla	It would be so much easier to be good if one's hair was a handsome auburn, don't you think? And now may I go out into your garden and sit on that bench under the apple-trees while you and [MASK] are talking?
AnneOfGreenGables	48	30024	30020	30068	Marilla	Take this chair, [MASK]; it's easier than the one you've got; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit on. Yes, she certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind of taking about her after all.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	30078	30048	30099	Matthew	Yes, she certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind of taking about her after all. I don't feel so surprised at you and [MASK] keeping her as I did--nor so sorry for you, either. She may turn out all right.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	30286	30235	30289	Marilla	"I apologized pretty well, didn't I?" she said proudly as they went down the lane. "I thought since I had to do it I might as well do it thoroughly." "You did it thoroughly, all right enough," was [MASK]'s comment.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	30314	30303	30350	Anne	She had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold [MASK] for apologizing so well; but then, that was ridiculous! She compromised with her conscience by saying severely: "I hope you won't have occasion to make many more such apologies.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	30384	30365	30420	Anne	"That wouldn't be so hard if people wouldn't twit me about my looks," said [MASK] with a sigh. "I don't get cross about other things; but I'm _so_ tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right over.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	30449	30421	30462	Anne	Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I grow up?" "You shouldn't think so much about your looks, [MASK]. I'm afraid you are a very vain little girl."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	30478	30451	30501	Anne	I'm afraid you are a very vain little girl." "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?" protested [MASK]. "I love pretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that isn't pretty.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	30825	30804	30857	Marilla	I could pray right now and not find it a bit hard." Something warm and pleasant welled up in [MASK]'s heart at touch of that thin little hand in her own--a throb of the maternity she had missed, perhaps. Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed her.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	30887	30850	30901	Anne	Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed her. She hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by inculcating a moral. "If you'll be a good girl you'll always be happy, [MASK]. And you should never find it hard to say your prayers."
AnneOfGreenGables	53	30918	30889	30942	Anne	And you should never find it hard to say your prayers." "Saying one's prayers isn't exactly the same thing as praying," said [MASK] meditatively. "But I'm going to imagine that I'm the wind that is blowing up there in those tree tops.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	31232	31220	31269	Marilla	"I don't want you to imagine it," said [MASK], offended. "Oh, I can see you don't like the dresses! What is the matter with them? Aren't they neat and clean and new?" "Yes."
AnneOfGreenGables	47	31290	31249	31296	Anne	What is the matter with them? Aren't they neat and clean and new?" "Yes." "Then why don't you like them?" "They're--they're not--pretty," said [MASK] reluctantly. "Pretty!"
AnneOfGreenGables	45	31322	31314	31359	Anne	I don't believe in pampering vanity, [MASK], I'll tell you that right off. Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable dresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they're all you'll get this summer.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	31436	31387	31437	Anne	I'll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear them. I should think you'd be grateful to get most anything after those skimpy wincey things you've been wearing." "Oh, I _am_ grateful," protested [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	49	31476	31438	31487	Marilla	"But I'd be ever so much gratefuller if--if you'd made just one of them with puffed sleeves. Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill, [MASK], just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	31551	31530	31581	Anne	"But I'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and sensible all by myself," persisted [MASK] mournfully. "Trust you for that! Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your closet, and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	31610	31610	31655	Anne	[MASK] clasped her hands and looked at the dresses. "I did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves," she whispered disconsolately. "I prayed for one, but I didn't much expect it on that account.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	31818	31818	31862	Anne	[MASK] started off irreproachable, arrayed in the stiff black-and-white sateen, which, while decent as regards length and certainly not open to the charge of skimpiness, contrived to emphasize every corner and angle of her thin figure.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	32001	31998	32051	Anne	Nothing daunted, [MASK] proceeded onward to the church alone. In the porch she found a crowd of little girls, all more or less gaily attired in whites and blues and pinks, and all staring with curious eyes at this stranger in their midst, with her extraordinary head adornment.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	32061	32009	32062	Anne	In the porch she found a crowd of little girls, all more or less gaily attired in whites and blues and pinks, and all staring with curious eyes at this stranger in their midst, with her extraordinary head adornment. Avonlea little girls had already heard queer stories about [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	47	32595	32561	32608	Marilla	There was a long row of white birches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through them, ?way, ?way down, deep into the water. Oh, [MASK], it was like a beautiful dream! It gave me a thrill
AnneOfGreenGables	59	33260	33211	33270	Marilla	It almost seemed to her that those secret, unuttered, critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible and accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity. CHAPTER XII. A Solemn Vow and Promise |IT was not until the next Friday that [MASK] heard the story of the flower-wreathed hat.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	33345	33329	33379	Anne	"Oh. I know pink and yellow aren't becoming to me," began [MASK]. "Becoming fiddlesticks! It was putting flowers on your hat at all, no matter what color they were, that was ridiculous. You are the most aggravating child!"
AnneOfGreenGables	52	33404	33372	33424	Anne	You are the most aggravating child!" "I don't see why it's any more ridiculous to wear flowers on your hat than on your dress," protested [MASK]. "Lots of little girls there had bouquets pinned on their dresses. What's the difference?"
AnneOfGreenGables	47	33558	33518	33565	Anne	She says people talked about it something dreadful. Of course they would think I had no better sense than to let you go decked out like that." "Oh, I'm so sorry," said [MASK], tears welling into her eyes.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	33681	33676	33727	Marilla	"Nonsense," said [MASK], vexed at herself for having made the child cry. "I don't want to send you back to the asylum, I'm sure. All I want is that you should behave like other little girls and not make yourself ridiculous.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	33816	33813	33861	Marilla	"Oh, [MASK], I'm frightened--now that it has come I'm actually frightened. What if she shouldn't like me! It would be the most tragical disappointment of my life." "Now, don't get into a fluster.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	33885	33852	33903	Diana	"Now, don't get into a fluster. And I do wish you wouldn't use such long words. It sounds so funny in a little girl. I guess [MASK] ?ll like you well enough. It's her mother you've got to reckon with.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	33981	33949	33993	Anne	You must be polite and well behaved, and don't make any of your startling speeches. For pity's sake, if the child isn't actually trembling!" [MASK] _was_ trembling. Her face was pale and tense.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	33997	33987	34040	Marilla	Her face was pale and tense. "Oh, [MASK], you'd be excited, too, if you were going to meet a little girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother mightn't like you," she said as she hastened to get her hat.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	34112	34075	34122	Marilla	She was a tall black-eyed, black-haired woman, with a very resolute mouth. She had the reputation of being very strict with her children. "How do you do, [MASK]?" she said cordially. "Come in.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	34248	34248	34298	Diana	[MASK] was sitting on the sofa, reading a book which she dropped when the callers entered. She was a very pretty little girl, with her mother's black eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, and the merry expression which was her inheritance from her father.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	34351	34329	34379	Marilla	It will be better for you than straining your eyes over that book. She reads entirely too much--" this to [MASK] as the little girls went out--"and I can't prevent her, for her father aids and abets her. She's always poring over a book.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	34750	34702	34752	Anne	It will be jolly to have somebody to play with. There isn't any other girl who lives near enough to play with, and I've no sisters big enough." "Will you swear to be my friend forever and ever?" demanded [MASK] eagerly.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	34801	34757	34809	Diana	"Why it's dreadfully wicked to swear," she said rebukingly. "Oh no, not my kind of swearing. There are two kinds, you know." "I never heard of but one kind," said [MASK] doubtfully. "There really is another.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	34840	34804	34851	Diana	"There really is another. Oh, it isn't wicked at all. It just means vowing and promising solemnly." "Well, I don't mind doing that," agreed [MASK], relieved. "How do you do it?"
AnneOfGreenGables	46	34862	34844	34890	Anne	"How do you do it?" "We must join hands--so," said [MASK] gravely. "It ought to be over running water. We'll just imagine this path is running water. I'll repeat the oath first.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	35149	35138	35186	Diana	Don't you think that is a very strange coincidence? [MASK] is going to lend me a book to read. She says it's perfectly splendid and tremendously exciting. She's going to show me a place back in the woods where rice lilies grow.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	35191	35160	35204	Diana	She says it's perfectly splendid and tremendously exciting. She's going to show me a place back in the woods where rice lilies grow. Don't you think [MASK] has got very soulful eyes? I wish I had soulful eyes.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	35276	35224	35277	Diana	She's going to give me a picture to put up in my room; it's a perfectly beautiful picture, she says--a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress. A sewing-machine agent gave it to her. I wish I had something to give [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	44	35284	35278	35322	Diana	I'm an inch taller than [MASK], but she is ever so much fatter; she says she'd like to be thin because it's so much more graceful, but I'm afraid she only said it to soothe my feelings.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	35414	35405	35446	Anne	"But remember this in all your planning, [MASK]. You're not going to play all the time nor most of it. You'll have your work to do and it'll have to be done first."
AnneOfGreenGables	47	35524	35499	35546	Marilla	"I heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties, so I got you some," he said. "Humph," sniffed [MASK]. "It'll ruin her teeth and stomach. There, there, child, don't look so dismal.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	35553	35535	35583	Matthew	There, there, child, don't look so dismal. You can eat those, since [MASK] has gone and got them. He'd better have brought you peppermints. They're wholesomer. Don't sicken yourself eating all them at once now."
AnneOfGreenGables	42	35614	35610	35652	Diana	And I can give [MASK] half of them, can't I? The other half will taste twice as sweet to me if I give some to her. It's delightful to think I have something to give her."
AnneOfGreenGables	46	35739	35694	35740	Matthew	Dear me, it's only three weeks since she came, and it seems as if she'd been here always. I can't imagine the place without her. Now, don't be looking I told-you-so, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	51	35872	35853	35904	Matthew	n I gave her leave to; and now she's perched out there on the woodpile talking to [MASK], nineteen to the dozen, when she knows perfectly well she ought to be at her work. And of course he's listening to her like a perfect ninny.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	36098	36085	36136	Marilla	"Two o'clock--but isn't it splendid about the picnic, [MASK]? Please can I go? Oh, I've never been to a picnic--I've dreamed of picnics, but I've never--" "Yes, I told you to come at two o'clock.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	36157	36105	36159	Anne	Oh, I've never been to a picnic--I've dreamed of picnics, but I've never--" "Yes, I told you to come at two o'clock. And it's a quarter to three. I'd like to know why you didn't obey me, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	55	36200	36200	36255	Matthew	[MASK] is such a sympathetic listener. Please can I go?" "You'll have to learn to resist the fascination of Idle-whatever-you-call-it. When I tell you to come in at a certain time I mean that time and not half an hour later.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	36345	36336	36379	Marilla	I can't cook, as you know, [MASK], and--and--I don't mind going to a picnic without puffed sleeves so much, but I'd feel terribly humiliated if I had to go without a basket.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	36418	36394	36439	Marilla	"Well, it needn't prey any longer. I'll bake you a basket." "Oh, you dear good [MASK]. Oh, you are so kind to me. Oh, I'm so much obliged to you."
AnneOfGreenGables	53	36496	36480	36533	Anne	Again that sudden sensation of startling sweetness thrilled her. She was secretly vastly pleased at [MASK]'s impulsive caress, which was probably the reason why she said brusquely: "There, there, never mind your kissing nonsense. I'd sooner see you doing strictly as you're told.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	36558	36534	36581	Anne	As for cooking, I mean to begin giving you lessons in that some of these days. But you're so featherbrained, [MASK], I've been waiting to see if you'd sober down a little and learn to be steady before I begin.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	36636	36610	36658	Anne	Now, get out your patchwork and have your square done before teatime." "I do _not_ like patchwork," said [MASK] dolefully, hunting out her workbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white diamonds with a sigh.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	36893	36851	36902	Diana	I assure you it took me some time to think it out. I stayed awake nearly a whole night before I invented it. Then, just as I was dropping off to sleep, it came like an inspiration. [MASK] was _enraptured_ when she heard it.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	36919	36903	36955	Marilla	We have got our house fixed up elegantly. You must come and see it, [MASK]--won't you? We have great big stones, all covered with moss, for seats, and boards from tree to tree for shelves. And we have all our dishes on them.
AnneOfGreenGables	59	37027	36979	37038	Diana	There's a piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful. We keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there, too. The fairy glass is as lovely as a dream. [MASK] found it out in the woods behind their chicken house.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	37144	37138	37181	Marilla	That was a thrilling book, [MASK]. The heroine had five lovers. I'd be satisfied with one, wouldn't you? She was very handsome and she went through great tribulations. She could faint as easy as anything.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	37195	37146	37196	Marilla	The heroine had five lovers. I'd be satisfied with one, wouldn't you? She was very handsome and she went through great tribulations. She could faint as easy as anything. I'd love to be able to faint, wouldn't you, [MASK]?
AnneOfGreenGables	51	37250	37231	37282	Diana	I look at my elbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming. [MASK] is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves. She is going to wear it to the picnic. Oh, I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	37446	37422	37469	Anne	"Now, just for curiosity's sake, see if you can hold your tongue for the same length of time." [MASK] held her tongue as desired. But for the rest of the week she talked picnic and thought picnic and dreamed picnic.
AnneOfGreenGables	56	37495	37453	37509	Marilla	But for the rest of the week she talked picnic and thought picnic and dreamed picnic. On Saturday it rained and she worked herself up into such a frantic state lest it should keep on raining until and over Wednesday that [MASK] made her sew an extra patchwork square by way of steadying her nerves.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	37553	37541	37586	Marilla	"Such a thrill as went up and down my back, [MASK]! I don't think I'd ever really believed until then that there was honestly going to be a picnic. I couldn't help fearing I'd only imagined it.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	37723	37693	37734	Marilla	Blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be disappointed.' But I think it would be worse to expect nothing than to be disappointed." [MASK] wore her amethyst brooch to church that day as usual.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	37793	37777	37820	Marilla	A seafaring uncle had given it to her mother who in turn had bequeathed it to [MASK]. It was an old-fashioned oval, containing a braid of her mother's hair, surrounded by a border of very fine amethysts.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	37821	37821	37870	Marilla	[MASK] knew too little about precious stones to realize how fine the amethysts actually were; but she thought them very beautiful and was always pleasantly conscious of their violet shimmer at her throat, above her good brown satin dress, even although she could not see it.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	37888	37885	37931	Marilla	"Oh, [MASK], it's a perfectly elegant brooch. I don't know how you can pay attention to the sermon or the prayers when you have it on. I couldn't, I know. I think amethysts are just sweet.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	38027	37979	38028	Marilla	When I saw a real diamond in a lady's ring one day I was so disappointed I cried. Of course, it was very lovely but it wasn't my idea of a diamond. Will you let me hold the brooch for one minute, [MASK]?
AnneOfGreenGables	50	38163	38118	38168	Anne	I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came home from church yesterday evening, but I can't find it anywhere." "I--I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society," said [MASK], a little slowly.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	38215	38204	38249	Anne	"Y-e-e-s," admitted [MASK], "I took it up and I pinned it on my breast just to see how it would look." "You had no business to do anything of the sort.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	38326	38309	38359	Marilla	I hadn't it on a minute. Truly, I didn't mean to meddle, [MASK]. I didn't think about its being wrong to go in and try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I'll never do it again.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	38471	38428	38477	Marilla	"I don't just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in the china tray. But I'm perfectly certain I put it back." "I'll go and have another look," said [MASK], determining to be just.
AnneOfGreenGables	56	38506	38478	38534	Marilla	"If you put that brooch back it's there still. If it isn't I'll know you didn't, that's all!" [MASK] went to her room and made a thorough search, not only over the bureau but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly be.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	38549	38535	38584	Anne	It was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen. "[MASK], the brooch is gone. By your own admission you were the last person to handle it. Now, what have you done with it? Tell me the truth at once.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	38656	38614	38658	Marilla	"I never took the brooch out of your room and that is the truth, if I was to be led to the block for it--although I'm not very certain what a block is. So there, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	55	38693	38683	38738	Anne	"I believe you are telling me a falsehood, [MASK]," she said sharply. "I know you are. There now, don't say anything more unless you are prepared to tell the whole truth. Go to your room and stay there until you are ready to confess."
AnneOfGreenGables	52	38750	38700	38752	Anne	"I know you are. There now, don't say anything more unless you are prepared to tell the whole truth. Go to your room and stay there until you are ready to confess." "Will I take the peas with me?" said [MASK] meekly.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	38798	38788	38830	Anne	She was worried about her valuable brooch. What if [MASK] had lost it? And how wicked of the child to deny having taken it, when anybody could see she must have! With such an innocent face, too!
AnneOfGreenGables	50	38847	38823	38873	Marilla	With such an innocent face, too! "I don't know what I wouldn't sooner have had happen," thought [MASK], as she nervously shelled the peas. "Of course, I don't suppose she meant to steal it or anything like that.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	39038	39008	39058	Marilla	I declare I feel worse about that than about the brooch. If she'd only have told the truth about it I wouldn't mind so much." [MASK] went to her room at intervals all through the evening and searched for the brooch, without finding it.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	39174	39128	39178	Marilla	"You're sure it hasn't fell down behind the bureau?" was the only suggestion he could offer. "I've moved the bureau and I've taken out the drawers and I've looked in every crack and cranny" was [MASK]'s positive answer.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	39276	39251	39295	Marilla	He felt no desire to put his oar in this time. "She'll stay in her room until she confesses," said [MASK] grimly, remembering the success of this method in the former case. "Then we'll see.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	39432	39413	39457	Marilla	She persisted in asserting that she had not taken the brooch. The child had evidently been crying and [MASK] felt a pang of pity which she sternly repressed. By night she was, as she expressed it, "beat out."
AnneOfGreenGables	42	39469	39443	39485	Anne	By night she was, as she expressed it, "beat out." "You'll stay in this room until you confess, [MASK]. You can make up your mind to that," she said firmly. "
AnneOfGreenGables	57	39567	39512	39569	Anne	You'll just let me out for the afternoon, won't you? Then I'll stay here as long as you like _afterwards_ cheerfully. But I _must_ go to the picnic." "You'll not go to picnics nor anywhere else until you've confessed, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	45	39805	39777	39822	Marilla	"I took it just as you said. I didn't mean to take it when I went in. But it did look so beautiful, [MASK], when I pinned it on my breast that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	39867	39867	39914	Diana	[MASK] and I make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts? So I took the brooch. I thought I could put it back before you came home. I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	40046	40018	40073	Anne	This child had taken and lost her treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly reciting the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or repentance. "[MASK], this is terrible," she said, trying to speak calmly. "You are the very wickedest girl I ever heard of."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	40107	40087	40138	Marilla	"And I know I'll have to be punished. It'll be your duty to punish me, [MASK]. Won't you please get it over right off because I'd like to go to the picnic with nothing on my mind." "Picnic, indeed!
AnneOfGreenGables	52	40228	40211	40263	Marilla	That was why I confessed. Punish me any way you like but that. Oh, [MASK], please, please, let me go to the picnic. Think of the ice cream! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice cream again."
AnneOfGreenGables	48	40351	40309	40357	Marilla	She clasped her hands together, gave a piercing shriek, and then flung herself face downward on the bed, crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of disappointment and despair. "For the land's sake!" gasped [MASK], hastening from the room.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	40392	40366	40415	Rachel	No child in her senses would behave as she does. If she isn't she's utterly bad. Oh dear, I'm afraid [MASK] was right from the first. But I've put my hand to the plow and I won't look back."
AnneOfGreenGables	43	40422	40399	40442	Marilla	But I've put my hand to the plow and I won't look back." That was a dismal morning. [MASK] worked fiercely and scrubbed the porch floor and the dairy shelves when she could find nothing else to do.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	40544	40524	40576	Marilla	My heart is broken. You'll feel remorse of conscience someday, I expect, for breaking it, [MASK], but I forgive you. Remember when the time comes that I forgive you. But please don't ask me to eat anything, especially boiled pork and greens.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	40816	40773	40818	Matthew	And you don't seem to realize it, neither; you're making excuses for her all the time to yourself--I can see that." "Well now, she's such a little thing," feebly reiterated [MASK]. "
AnneOfGreenGables	45	40908	40894	40939	Marilla	When her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed [MASK] remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black lace shawl when she had taken it off on Monday afternoon on returning from the Ladies' Aid.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	41115	41080	41126	Marilla	I remember now that when I took off my shawl Monday afternoon I laid it on the bureau for a minute. I suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow. Well!" [MASK] betook herself to the east gable, brooch in hand.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	41195	41163	41214	Anne	Now I want to know what that rigmarole you told me this morning meant." "Why, you said you'd keep me here until I confessed," returned [MASK] wearily, "and so I decided to confess because I was bound to get to the picnic.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	41272	41236	41286	Marilla	And I said it over and over so that I wouldn't forget it. But you wouldn't let me go to the picnic after all, so all my trouble was wasted." [MASK] had to laugh in spite of herself. But her conscience pricked her.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	41288	41281	41322	Anne	But her conscience pricked her. "[MASK], you do beat all! But I was wrong--I see that now. I shouldn't have doubted your word when I'd never known you to tell a story.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	41364	41323	41376	Anne	Of course, it wasn't right for you to confess to a thing you hadn't done--it was very wrong to do so. But I drove you to it. So if you'll forgive me, [MASK], I'll forgive you and we'll start square again.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	41397	41394	41447	Marilla	"Oh, [MASK], isn't it too late?" "No, it's only two o'clock. They won't be more than well gathered yet and it'll be an hour before they have tea. Wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	41470	41435	41485	Jerry	Wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham. I'll fill a basket for you. There's plenty of stuff baked in the house. And I'll get [MASK] to hitch up the sorrel and drive you down to the picnic ground."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	41710	41670	41719	Marilla	It would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly drowned. It would be such a thrilling tale to tell. And we had the ice cream. Words fail me to describe that ice cream. [MASK], I assure you it was sublime."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	41768	41760	41810	Anne	I have to laugh when I think of [MASK]'s ?confession,' although I suppose I shouldn't for it really was a falsehood. But it doesn't seem as bad as the other would have been, somehow, and anyhow I'm responsible for it.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	41868	41851	41902	Anne	CHAPTER XV. A Tempest in the School Teapot "WHAT a splendid day!" said [MASK], drawing a long breath. "Isn't it good just to be alive on a day like this? I pity the people who aren't born yet for missing it.
AnneOfGreenGables	56	41964	41942	41998	Diana	"It's a lot nicer than going round by the road; that is so dusty and hot," said [MASK] practically, peeping into her dinner basket and mentally calculating if the three juicy, toothsome, raspberry tarts reposing there were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl would have.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	42479	42465	42518	Diana	It's nice to be clever at something, isn't it? But [MASK] named the Birch Path. She wanted to, so I let her; but I'm sure I could have found something more poetical than plain Birch Path. Anybody can think of a name like that.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	42533	42485	42535	Marilla	She wanted to, so I let her; but I'm sure I could have found something more poetical than plain Birch Path. Anybody can think of a name like that. But the Birch Path is one of the prettiest places in the world, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	46	43155	43111	43157	Anne	And I want you to understand right off that you are not to come home telling tales about him. That is something I won't encourage. I hope you were a good girl." "Indeed I was," said [MASK] comfortably.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	43233	43195	43238	Diana	There are a lot of nice girls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime. It's so nice to have a lot of little girls to play with. But of course I like [MASK] best and always will.
AnneOfGreenGables	59	43243	43239	43298	Diana	I _adore_ [MASK]. I'm dreadfully far behind the others. They're all in the fifth book and I'm only in the fourth. I feel that it's kind of a disgrace. But there's not one of them has such an imagination as I have and I soon found that out.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	43743	43730	43779	Anne	"Oh, don't speak about freckles to me," implored [MASK]. "It isn't delicate when I've got so many. But I do think that writing take-notices up on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	43815	43780	43826	Anne	I should just like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy's. Not, of course," she hastened to add, "that anybody would." [MASK] sighed. She didn't want her name written up.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	43957	43917	43963	Anne	He told his mother--his _mother_, mind you--that you were the smartest girl in school. That's better than being good looking." "No, it isn't," said [MASK], feminine to the core.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	44235	44199	44248	Diana	I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all." "Those Pye girls are cheats all round," said [MASK] indignantly, as they climbed the fence of the main road. "
AnneOfGreenGables	43	45182	45182	45225	Anne	[MASK] stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her. She did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	45528	45485	45532	Anne	He's called me a crow a dozen times; and I never heard him apologize for anything before, either." "There's a great deal of difference between being called a crow and being called carrots," said [MASK] with dignity. "
AnneOfGreenGables	44	46156	46129	46173	Anne	but I didn't suppose you really meant it." "I assure you I did"--still with the sarcastic inflection which all the children, and [MASK] especially, hated. It flicked on the raw. "Obey me at once."
AnneOfGreenGables	54	46817	46764	46818	Diana	"I'd let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But I can't do this, so please don't ask it. You harrow up my very soul." "Just think of all the fun you will miss," mourned [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	53	47029	47022	47075	Marilla	"I'm not going back, [MASK]. I'll learn my lessons at home and I'll be as good as I can be and hold my tongue all the time if it's possible at all. But I will not go back to school, I assure you."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	47203	47185	47235	Rachel	But it would never do to say so to her. I'll just talk it over with [MASK]. She's sent ten children to school and she ought to know something about it. She'll have heard the whole story, too, by this time."
AnneOfGreenGables	46	47318	47305	47351	Marilla	"I don't know what to do with her," said [MASK]. "She declares she won't go back to school. I never saw a child so worked up. I've been expecting trouble ever since she started to school.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	47373	47320	47375	Rachel	"She declares she won't go back to school. I never saw a child so worked up. I've been expecting trouble ever since she started to school. I knew things were going too smooth to last. She's so high strung. What would you advise, [MASK]?"
AnneOfGreenGables	55	47481	47447	47502	Anne	And of course he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who were late should have been punished as well as [MASK], that's what. And I don't believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	47565	47538	47587	Marilla	I never thought she'd take with them so well." "Then you really think I'd better let her stay home," said [MASK] in amazement. "Yes. That is I wouldn't say school to her again until she said it herself.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	48030	48012	48059	Diana	I cannot ever live without her. But I know very well when we grow up that [MASK] will get married and go away and leave me. And oh, what shall I do? I hate her husband--I just hate him furiously.
AnneOfGreenGables	58	48073	48060	48118	Diana	I've been imagining it all out--the wedding and everything--[MASK] dressed in snowy garments, with a veil, and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen; and me the bridesmaid, with a lovely dress too, and puffed sleeves, but with a breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	48320	48317	48371	Marilla	"Oh, [MASK]," she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, "I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn't it?
AnneOfGreenGables	43	48406	48372	48415	Marilla	Look at these maple branches. Don't they give you a thrill--several thrills? I'm going to decorate my room with them." "Messy things," said [MASK], whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	48451	48443	48490	Marilla	"Oh, and dream in too, [MASK]. And you know one can dream so much better in a room where there are pretty things. I'm going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	48606	48606	48657	Matthew	[MASK] was so good. He never scolded a bit. He put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not. And I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting, so he didn't find the time long at all.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	48665	48617	48666	Marilla	He put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not. And I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting, so he didn't find the time long at all. It was a beautiful fairy story, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	51	48761	48725	48776	Diana	But you keep your wits about you this time. And--I don't really know if I'm doing right--it may make you more addlepated than ever--but you can ask [MASK] to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here."
AnneOfGreenGables	45	48783	48783	48828	Anne	[MASK] clasped her hands. "How perfectly lovely! You _are_ able to imagine things after all or else you'd never have understood how I've longed for that very thing. It will seem so nice and grown-uppish.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	48847	48819	48868	Marilla	It will seem so nice and grown-uppish. No fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when I have company. Oh, [MASK], can I use the rosebud spray tea set?" "No, indeed! The rosebud tea set!
AnneOfGreenGables	45	48966	48927	48972	Anne	And you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps." "I can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and pouring out the tea," said [MASK], shutting her eyes ecstatically.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	48976	48973	49018	Diana	"And asking [MASK] if she takes sugar! I know she doesn't but of course I'll ask her just as if I didn't know. And then pressing her to take another piece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	49021	48982	49033	Marilla	I know she doesn't but of course I'll ask her just as if I didn't know. And then pressing her to take another piece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves. Oh, [MASK], it's a wonderful sensation just to think of it.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	49247	49220	49274	Anne	At other times she was wont to run into the kitchen without knocking; but now she knocked primly at the front door. And when [MASK], dressed in her second best, as primly opened it, both little girls shook hands as gravely as if they had never met before.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	49439	49400	49448	Anne	I hope your father's crop is good too." "It is fairly good, thank you. Have you picked many of your apples yet?" "Oh, ever so many," said [MASK] forgetting to be dignified and jumping up quickly.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	49480	49480	49534	Marilla	[MASK] is a very generous woman. She said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea. But it isn't good manners to tell your company what you are going to give them to eat, so I won't tell you what she said we could have to drink.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	49992	49965	50013	Diana	"I don't believe I'll have any just now. I don't feel as if I wanted any after all those apples." [MASK] poured herself out a tumblerful, looked at its bright-red hue admiringly, and then sipped it daintily.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	50022	50014	50067	Anne	"That's awfully nice raspberry cordial, [MASK]," she said. "I didn't know raspberry cordial was so nice." "I'm real glad you like it. Take as much as you want. I'm going to run out and stir the fire up.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	50223	50210	50262	Diana	She is trying to teach me to cook but I assure you, [MASK], it is uphill work. There's so little scope for imagination in cookery. You just have to go by rules. The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	50274	50230	50275	Diana	There's so little scope for imagination in cookery. You just have to go by rules. The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in. I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	47	50364	50355	50402	Diana	Oh, it was such a pathetic tale, [MASK]. The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake. But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure. Flour is so essential to cakes, you know.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	50403	50380	50431	Marilla	But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure. Flour is so essential to cakes, you know. [MASK] was very cross and I don't wonder. I'm a great trial to her. She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	50455	50421	50476	Marilla	She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week. We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over. [MASK] said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	50553	50541	50596	Diana	I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry. [MASK], fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	50884	50884	50937	Marilla	[MASK] turned red as fire but she never said a word--then. She just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves. She even offered me some, but I couldn't swallow a mouthful. It was like heaping coals of fire on my head.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	50962	50962	51007	Diana	[MASK] had stood up very unsteadily; then she sat down again, putting her hands to her head. "I'm--I'm awful sick," she said, a little thickly. "I--I--must go right home."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	51024	50997	51047	Anne	"I--I--must go right home." "Oh, you mustn't dream of going home without your tea," cried [MASK] in distress. "I'll get it right off--I'll go and put the tea down this very minute."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	51073	51062	51113	Anne	"Let me get you a lunch anyhow," implored [MASK]. "Let me give you a bit of fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves. Lie down on the sofa for a little while and you'll be better. Where do you feel bad?"
AnneOfGreenGables	55	51122	51076	51131	Diana	Let me give you a bit of fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves. Lie down on the sofa for a little while and you'll be better. Where do you feel bad?" "I must go home," said [MASK], and that was all she would say.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	51155	51137	51186	Diana	"I never heard of company going home without tea," she mourned. "Oh, [MASK], do you suppose that it's possible you're really taking the smallpox? If you are I'll go and nurse you, you can depend on that.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	51219	51171	51220	Diana	If you are I'll go and nurse you, you can depend on that. I'll never forsake you. But I do wish you'd stay till after tea. Where do you feel bad?" "I'm awful dizzy," said [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	50	52044	52001	52051	Anne	I just kept that bottle for sickness. There, there, child, don't cry. I can't see as you were to blame although I'm sorry it happened so." "I must cry," said [MASK]. "My heart is broken.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	52204	52174	52215	Marilla	You're so much more dignified than I am. Likely she'd listen to you quicker than to me." "Well, I will," said [MASK], reflecting that it would probably be the wiser course.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	52621	52612	52663	Diana	I did not mean to--to--intoxicate [MASK]. How could I? Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the world. Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose?
AnneOfGreenGables	50	52692	52664	52714	Diana	I thought it was only raspberry cordial. I was firmly convinced it was raspberry cordial. Oh, please don't say that you won't let [MASK] play with me any more. If you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe."
AnneOfGreenGables	58	53255	53199	53257	Anne	I had ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to you. She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she's timing me by the clock." "Ten minutes isn't very long to say an eternal farewell in," said [MASK] tearfully.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	53366	53347	53391	Anne	"Why, of course I do. Didn't you know that?" "No." [MASK] drew a long breath. "I thought you _liked_ me of course but I never hoped you _loved_ me.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	53394	53372	53420	Diana	"I thought you _liked_ me of course but I never hoped you _loved_ me. Why, [MASK], I didn't think anybody could love me. Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is wonderful!
AnneOfGreenGables	46	53441	53405	53451	Diana	Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is wonderful! It's a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness of a path severed from thee, [MASK]. Oh, just say it once again."
AnneOfGreenGables	47	53525	53498	53545	Diana	"In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my lonely life, as that last story we read together says. [MASK], wilt thou give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure forevermore?"
AnneOfGreenGables	47	53746	53733	53780	Diana	Somehow, little dream girls are not satisfying after a real friend. [MASK] and I had such an affecting farewell down by the spring. It will be sacred in my memory forever. I used the most pathetic language I could think of and said ?
AnneOfGreenGables	49	53805	53805	53854	Diana	[MASK] gave me a lock of her hair and I'm going to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my life. Please see that it is buried with me, for I don't believe I'll live very long.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	54009	53996	54047	Marilla	"You'd better muse over your lessons and sums," said [MASK], concealing her delight at this development of the situation. "If you're going back to school I hope we'll hear no more of breaking slates over people's heads and such carryings on.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	54072	54021	54074	Anne	"If you're going back to school I hope we'll hear no more of breaking slates over people's heads and such carryings on. Behave yourself and do just what your teacher tells you." "I'll try to be a model pupil," agreed [MASK] dolefully.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	54171	54161	54208	Anne	I should weep bitter tears if I did." [MASK] was welcomed back to school with open arms. Her imagination had been sorely missed in games, her voice in the singing and her dramatic ability in the perusal aloud of books at dinner hour.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	54786	54786	54833	Anne	[MASK] read the note, kissed the bookmark, and dispatched a prompt reply back to the other side of the school. My own darling Diana:-- Of course I am not cross at you because you have to obey your mother. Our spirits can commune.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	55228	55211	55256	Gilbert	The second Anne beat him by five. But her triumph was marred by the fact that [MASK] congratulated her heartily before the whole school. It would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had felt the sting of his defeat.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	55466	55433	55484	Marilla	Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her with an _inextinguishable_ love. It makes me very sad at times to think about her. But really, [MASK], one can't stay sad very long in such an interesting world, can one?"
AnneOfGreenGables	43	55941	55933	55976	Anne	"I wish you had," sighed [MASK], "because then you'd be able to sympathize with me. You can't sympathize properly if you've never studied it. It is casting a cloud over my whole life.
AnneOfGreenGables	56	56108	56086	56142	Anne	"I'm sure I'd get on better with geometry if only he wouldn't change the letters," complained [MASK]. "I learn the proposition off by heart and then he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what are in the book and I get all mixed up.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	56657	56657	56699	Jane	[MASK] said she cried herself sick over it. I love a book that makes me cry. But I think I'll carry that book into the sitting room and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	56711	56675	56729	Matthew	But I think I'll carry that book into the sitting room and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key. And you must _not_ give it to me, [MASK], until my lessons are done, not even if I implore you on my bended knees.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	56771	56730	56780	Matthew	It's all very well to say resist temptation, but it's ever so much easier to resist it if you can't get the key. And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets, [MASK]? Wouldn't you like some russets?"
AnneOfGreenGables	58	57248	57213	57271	Lover	Just wait till I get the ipecac bottle--you mayn't have any at your house. Come on now." The two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through [MASK]'s Lane and across the crusted field beyond, for the snow was too deep to go by the shorter wood way.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	57750	57738	57784	Anne	"I was awfully near giving up in despair," explained [MASK]. "She got worse and worse until she was sicker than ever the Hammond twins were, even the last pair. I actually thought she was going to choke to death.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	57923	57894	57940	Anne	You know there are some things that cannot be expressed in words." "Yes, I know," nodded the doctor. He looked at [MASK] as if he were thinking some things about her that couldn't be expressed in words.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	57964	57955	57998	Cuthbert	"That little redheaded girl they have over at [MASK]'s is as smart as they make ?em. I tell you she saved that baby's life, for it would have been too late by the time I got there.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	58238	58230	58283	Gil	But I hate to stay home, for [MASK]--some of the others will get head of the class, and it's so hard to get up again--although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you have when you do get up, haven't you?"
AnneOfGreenGables	51	58492	58492	58543	Matthew	[MASK] has been telling me about last night. I must say it was fortunate you knew what to do. I wouldn't have had any idea myself, for I never saw a case of croup. There now, never mind talking till you've had your dinner.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	58786	58783	58826	Marilla	"Oh, [MASK], can I go right now--without washing my dishes? I'll wash them when I come back, but I cannot tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment."
AnneOfGreenGables	41	58837	58799	58840	Marilla	I'll wash them when I come back, but I cannot tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment." "Yes, yes, run along," said [MASK] indulgently. "
AnneOfGreenGables	50	58904	58867	58917	Anne	She's gone without a cap or wrap. Look at her tearing through the orchard with her hair streaming. It'll be a mercy if she doesn't catch her death of cold." [MASK] came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy places.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	59001	58991	59032	Marilla	"You see before you a perfectly happy person, [MASK]," she announced. "I'm perfectly happy--yes, in spite of my red hair. Just at present I have a soul above red hair.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	59326	59286	59327	Marilla	I can't tell you what a thrill it gave me. Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before. And we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of preserves, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	54	59407	59394	59448	Anne	"Well, anyway, when I am grown up," said [MASK] decidedly, "I'm always going to talk to little girls as if they were too, and I'll never laugh when they use big words. I know from sorrowful experience how that hurts one's feelings.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	59477	59477	59530	Diana	[MASK] left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and I forgot and let it burn; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat walked over one plate and that had to be thrown away. But the making of it was splendid fun.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	59664	59661	59711	Diana	"You and [MASK] walked home from school together and then stood down there in the snow for half an hour more, your tongues going the whole blessed time, clickety-clack. So I don't think you're very badly off to see her again."
AnneOfGreenGables	55	59722	59712	59767	Anne	"But she wants to see me," pleaded [MASK]. "She has something very important to tell me." "How do you know she has?" "Because she just signaled to me from her window. We have arranged a way to signal with our candles and cardboard.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	59800	59755	59802	Marilla	We have arranged a way to signal with our candles and cardboard. We set the candle on the window sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth. So many flashes mean a certain thing. It was my idea, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	52	59843	59816	59868	Marilla	"And the next thing you'll be setting fire to the curtains with your signaling nonsense." "Oh, we're very careful, [MASK]. And it's so interesting. Two flashes mean, ?Are you there?' Three mean ?yes' and four ?
AnneOfGreenGables	49	59892	59861	59910	Diana	Three mean ?yes' and four ?no.' Five mean, ?Come over as soon as possible, because I have something important to reveal.' [MASK] has just signaled five flashes, and I'm really suffering to know what it is."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	60173	60158	60208	Anne	"I'm sure the Debating Club is a most respectable affair," pleaded [MASK]. "I'm not saying it isn't. But you're not going to begin gadding about to concerts and staying out all hours of the night. Pretty doings for children.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	60285	60270	60320	Marilla	Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight.' That is such a good moral piece, [MASK], I'm sure it would do me lots of good to hear it. And the choir are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	60324	60301	60348	Marilla	And the choir are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns. And oh, [MASK], the minister is going to take part; yes, indeed, he is; he's going to give an address.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	60660	60650	60698	Diana	"I might have let her spend the night with [MASK], if that was all. But I don't approve of this concert plan. She'd go there and catch cold like as not, and have her head filled up with nonsense and excitement.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	60723	60677	60725	Matthew	She'd go there and catch cold like as not, and have her head filled up with nonsense and excitement. It would unsettle her for a week. I understand that child's disposition and what's good for it better than you, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	47	61015	60980	61027	Marilla	But then just think of all the mistakes I don't make, although I might. I'll get some sand and scrub up the spots before I go to school. Oh, [MASK], my heart was just set on going to that concert.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	61069	61028	61071	Matthew	I never was to a concert in my life, and when the other girls talk about them in school I feel so out of it. You didn't know just how I felt about it, but you see [MASK] did.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	61663	61638	61685	Diana	I feel so different that it seems to me it must show in my looks." "You look awfully nice," said [MASK], who having just received a compliment from one of her cousins, felt that she ought to pass it on.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	62102	62078	62122	Diana	"It must be splendid to get up and recite there. Do you suppose we will ever be asked to do it, [MASK]?" "Yes, of course, someday. They're always wanting the big scholars to recite.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	62139	62127	62179	Anne	and he's only two years older than us. Oh, [MASK], how could you pretend not to listen to him? When he came to the line, ?_There's Another_, not _a sister_,' he looked right down at you."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	62237	62217	62268	Diana	Let's run a race and see who'll get to the bed first." The suggestion appealed to [MASK]. The two little white-clad figures flew down the long room, through the spare-room door, and bounded on the bed at the same moment.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	62886	62862	62917	Diana	She'd have gone today if they could have taken her. She had promised to pay for a quarter's music lessons for [MASK], but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a tomboy. Oh, I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	63082	63069	63113	Anne	"Oh, but that's the best of it," protested [MASK]. "Something just flashes into your mind, so exciting, and you must out with it. If you stop to think it over you spoil it all.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	63283	63275	63319	Anne	"She was fairly dancing with rage, [MASK]. Oh, how she scolded. She said I was the worst-behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed of the way they had brought me up.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	63474	63454	63496	Diana	"I'd rather walk up to a cannon's mouth. But I've got to do it, [MASK]. It was my fault and I've got to confess. I've had practice in confessing, fortunately."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	63508	63487	63538	Diana	I've had practice in confessing, fortunately." "Well, she's in the room," said [MASK]. "You can go in if you want to. I wouldn't dare. And I don't believe you'll do a bit of good."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	63542	63525	63575	Anne	And I don't believe you'll do a bit of good." With this encouragement [MASK] bearded the lion in its den--that is to say, walked resolutely up to the sitting-room door and knocked faintly. A sharp "Come in" followed.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	63899	63876	63928	Diana	I've been so used in my early days to having people cross at me that I can endure it much better than [MASK] can." Much of the snap had gone out of the old lady's eyes by this time and was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	64018	63967	64020	Anne	You don't know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long and arduous journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you." "I don't _know_, but I can _imagine_," said [MASK] eagerly.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	64246	64199	64248	Anne	"I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as mine. It all depends on the way we look at it. Sit down here and tell me about yourself." "I am very sorry I can't," said [MASK] firmly.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	64602	64575	64627	Matthew	"You wouldn't think so to look at her, but she is. You don't find it right out at first, as in [MASK]'s case, but after a while you come to see it. Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	64916	64888	64939	Marilla	I think they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, [MASK]. We had our lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	65255	65229	65271	Annes	But when I'm up in school it's all different and I care as much as ever. There's such a lot of different [MASK] in me. I sometimes think that is why I'm such a troublesome person.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	65584	65540	65593	Anne	She hung them over a chair and sat down with a short sigh. She had had one of her headaches that afternoon, and although the pain had gone she felt weak and "tuckered out," as she expressed it. [MASK] looked at her with eyes limpid with sympathy.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	65641	65611	65658	Marilla	I would have endured it joyfully for your sake." "I guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me rest," said [MASK]. "You seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer mistakes than usual.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	65668	65659	65708	Matthew	Of course it wasn't exactly necessary to starch [MASK]'s handkerchiefs! And most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it to be burned to a crisp.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	65724	65672	65727	Marilla	And most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it to be burned to a crisp. But that doesn't seem to be your way evidently." Headaches always left [MASK] somewhat sarcastic.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	65738	65728	65775	Anne	"Oh, I'm so sorry," said [MASK] penitently. "I never thought about that pie from the moment I put it in the oven till now, although I felt _instinctively_ that there was something missing on the dinner table.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	65887	65849	65895	Diana	So that is how I came to forget the pie. I didn't know I starched the handkerchiefs. All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a name for a new island [MASK] and I have discovered up the brook.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	65987	65953	66001	Marilla	But I'm sorry about that pie and the handkerchiefs. I wanted to be extra good today because it's an anniversary. Do you remember what happened this day last year, [MASK]?" "No, I can't think of anything special."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	66266	66242	66292	Anne	Go at once and be smart too." "I'll have to go around by the road, then," said [MASK], taking up her hat reluctantly. "Go by the road and waste half an hour! I'd like to catch you!"
AnneOfGreenGables	51	66342	66318	66369	Anne	Are you crazy? What under the canopy is the Haunted Wood?" "The spruce wood over the brook," said [MASK] in a whisper. "Fiddlesticks! There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere. Who has been telling you such stuff?"
AnneOfGreenGables	55	66423	66415	66470	Marilla	A haunted wood is so very romantic, [MASK]. We chose the spruce grove because it's so gloomy. Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. There's a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	66890	66884	66928	Barry	You'll go right over to [MASK]'s, and you'll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to you. And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods again."
AnneOfGreenGables	54	66929	66912	66966	Anne	And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods again." [MASK] might plead and cry as she liked--and did, for her terror was very real. Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce grove in mortal dread after nightfall.
AnneOfGreenGables	56	66968	66948	67004	Marilla	Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce grove in mortal dread after nightfall. But [MASK] was inexorable. She marched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her to proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of wailing ladies and headless specters beyond.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	67008	66972	67017	Marilla	She marched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her to proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of wailing ladies and headless specters beyond. "Oh, [MASK], how can you be so cruel?"
AnneOfGreenGables	50	67049	67021	67071	Marilla	"What would you feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?" "I'll risk it," said [MASK] unfeelingly. "You know I always mean what I say. I'll cure you of imagining ghosts into places.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	67077	67052	67097	Anne	"You know I always mean what I say. I'll cure you of imagining ghosts into places. March, now." [MASK] marched. That is, she stumbled over the bridge and went shuddering up the horrible dim path beyond.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	67098	67098	67148	Anne	[MASK] never forgot that walk. Bitterly did she repent the license she had given to her imagination. The goblins of her fancy lurked in every shadow about her, reaching out their cold, fleshless hands to grasp the terrified small girl who had called them into being.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	67280	67280	67326	Anne	[MASK] went back over it with shut eyes, preferring to take the risk of dashing her brains out among the boughs to that of seeing a white thing. When she finally stumbled over the log bridge she drew one long shivering breath of relief.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	67654	67610	67663	Marilla	e' on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he had been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn't, [MASK], and I just had to cry too.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	67738	67693	67743	Marilla	Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn't cry--because she hadn't brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh, [MASK], it was heartrending.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	68803	68770	68812	Avonlea	The new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still on their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for their chosen lifework. [MASK] opened its heart to them from the start.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	68914	68890	68941	Marilla	She said right away she didn't think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions, and you know, [MASK], that is exactly what I've always thought. She said we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	69061	69052	69094	Marilla	I wish I had dimples in my cheeks, [MASK]. I'm not half so skinny as I was when I came here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence people for good.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	69214	69203	69248	Anne	"Oh, of course he's good," agreed [MASK], "but he doesn't seem to get any comfort out of it. If I could be good I'd dance and sing all day because I was glad of it.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	69355	69324	69376	Matthew	"They've been most everywhere but here. Let me see. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don't say a word to [MASK] about it, for if he knew they were coming he'd find some excuse to be away that day.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	69800	69786	69833	Diana	I just grow cold when I think of my layer cake. Oh, [MASK], what if it shouldn't be good! I dreamed last night that I was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head."
AnneOfGreenGables	45	69845	69810	69855	Diana	I dreamed last night that I was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head." "It'll be good, all right," assured [MASK], who was a very comfortable sort of friend.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	70049	70036	70085	Anne	"But it's so easy to imagine there is," said [MASK]. "Every night before I go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really sitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	70118	70118	70169	Anne	[MASK] got up at sunrise because she was too excited to sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of her dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short of absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary matters that morning.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	70206	70179	70225	Marilla	When she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath. "I'm sure I haven't forgotten anything this time, [MASK]. But do you think it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn't good?
AnneOfGreenGables	45	70409	70381	70426	Marilla	," she said. "Can I fix the table with ferns and wild roses?" "I think that's all nonsense," sniffed [MASK]. "In my opinion it's the eatables that matter and not flummery decorations."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	70981	70956	71006	Anne	I had my suspicions of that bak--" "Baking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you used." [MASK] fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially filled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, "Best Vanilla."
AnneOfGreenGables	55	71082	71035	71090	Anne	I broke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an old empty vanilla bottle. I suppose it's partly my fault--I should have warned you--but for pity's sake why couldn't you have smelled it?" [MASK] dissolved into tears under this double disgrace.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	71681	71669	71710	Marilla	"But have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me, [MASK]? I never make the same mistake twice." "I don't know as that's much benefit when you're always making new ones."
AnneOfGreenGables	48	71719	71711	71759	Marilla	"Oh, don't you see, [MASK]? There must be a limit to the mistakes one person can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I'll be through with them. That's a very comforting thought."
AnneOfGreenGables	57	71777	71721	71778	Marilla	There must be a limit to the mistakes one person can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I'll be through with them. That's a very comforting thought." "Well, you'd better go and give that cake to the pigs," said [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	52	71850	71839	71891	Anne	Have you discovered another kindred spirit?" Excitement hung around [MASK] like a garment, shone in her eyes, kindled in every feature. She had come dancing up the lane, like a wind-blown sprite, through the mellow sunshine and lazy shadows of the August evening.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	71895	71865	71915	Marilla	She had come dancing up the lane, like a wind-blown sprite, through the mellow sunshine and lazy shadows of the August evening. "No, [MASK], but oh, what do you think? I am invited to tea at the manse tomorrow afternoon!
AnneOfGreenGables	49	72032	72021	72070	Anne	Do learn to take things calmly, child." For [MASK] to take things calmly would have been to change her nature. All "spirit and fire and dew," as she was, the pleasures and pains of life came to her with trebled intensity.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	72071	72071	72112	Marilla	[MASK] felt this and was vaguely troubled over it, realizing that the ups and downs of existence would probably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently understanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more than compensate.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	72171	72148	72189	Anne	She did not make much headway, as she sorrowfully admitted to herself. The downfall of some dear hope or plan plunged [MASK] into "deeps of affliction." The fulfillment thereof exalted her to dizzy realms of delight.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	72385	72382	72431	Marilla	"Oh, [MASK], there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody I see," she exclaimed as she washed the breakfast dishes. "You don't know how good I feel! Wouldn't it be nice if it could last?
AnneOfGreenGables	50	72454	72412	72462	Marilla	"You don't know how good I feel! Wouldn't it be nice if it could last? I believe I could be a model child if I were just invited out to tea every day. But oh, [MASK], it's a solemn occasion too.
AnneOfGreenGables	57	72569	72523	72580	Anne	I'm so afraid I'll do something silly or forget to do something I should do. Would it be good manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to _very_ much?" "The trouble with you, [MASK], is that you're thinking too much about yourself.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	72803	72800	72844	Marilla	"Oh, [MASK], I've had a most _fascinating_ time. I feel that I have not lived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never be invited to tea at a manse again.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	72903	72886	72934	Marilla	I really think I'd like to be a minister's wife when I grow up, [MASK]. A minister mightn't mind my red hair because he wouldn't be thinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to be naturally good
AnneOfGreenGables	42	73265	73238	73280	Diana	You can't think how I was thrilled at the mere thought. I've longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir, as [MASK] does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	74005	74005	74059	Josie	[MASK] walked the Barry fence with an airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that wasn't worth a "dare." Reluctant admiration greeted her exploit, for most of the other girls could appreciate it, having suffered many things themselves in their efforts to walk fences.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	74203	74203	74253	Anne	[MASK] turned pale, but there was clearly only one thing to be done. She walked toward the house, where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen roof. All the fifth-class girls said, "Oh!" partly in excitement, partly in dismay.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	74341	74341	74395	Anne	[MASK] climbed the ladder amid breathless silence, gained the ridgepole, balanced herself uprightly on that precarious footing, and started to walk along it, dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably high up in the world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your imagination helped you out much.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	75059	75023	75068	Marilla	Let us look on the bright side of things." "I might have known you'd go and do something of the sort when I let you go to that party," said [MASK], sharp and shrewish in her very relief.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	75244	75229	75277	Anne	"And that is just why you should be sorry for me," said [MASK], "because the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard. If I could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	75285	75264	75312	Marilla	If I could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better. But what would you have done, [MASK], if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?" "I'd have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	75380	75351	75406	Marilla	She would have crowed over me all my life. And I think I have been punished so much that you needn't be very cross with me, [MASK]. It's not a bit nice to faint, after all. And the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	75448	75407	75458	Gil	I won't be able to go around for six or seven weeks and I'll miss the new lady teacher. She won't be new any more by the time I'm able to go to school. And [MASK]--everybody will get ahead of me in class.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	75501	75489	75539	Marilla	"There, there, I'm not cross," said [MASK]. "You're an unlucky child, there's no doubt about that; but as you say, you'll have the suffering of it. Here now, try and eat some supper."
AnneOfGreenGables	52	75554	75503	75555	Anne	"You're an unlucky child, there's no doubt about that; but as you say, you'll have the suffering of it. Here now, try and eat some supper." "Isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination?" said [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	45	75931	75922	75967	Marilla	Isn't that something to be proud of, [MASK]? When a minister's wife has so many claims on her time! She is such a cheerful person to have visit you, too. She never tells you it's your own fault
AnneOfGreenGables	48	76075	76033	76081	Diana	I received her as politely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk a ridgepole. If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden of remorse all her life. [MASK] has been a faithful friend.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	76129	76094	76142	Diana	But oh, I shall be so glad when I can go to school for I've heard such exciting things about the new teacher. The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. [MASK] says she has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	76716	76679	76731	Mary	When she pronounces my name I feel _instinctively_ that she's spelling it with an E. We had recitations this afternoon. I just wish you could have been there to hear me recite ?[MASK], Queen of Scots.' I just put my whole soul into it.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	76796	76747	76797	Matthew	Now for my father's arm,' she said, ?my woman's heart farewell,' just made her blood run cold." "Well now, you might recite it for me some of these days, out in the barn," suggested [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	49	76806	76798	76847	Anne	"Of course I will," said [MASK] meditatively, "but I won't be able to do it so well, I know. It won't be so exciting as it is when you have a whole schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your words.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	77001	76953	77002	Marilla	We have to write compositions on our field afternoons and I write the best ones." "It's very vain of you to say so then. You'd better let your teacher say it." "But she _did_ say it, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	49	77360	77360	77409	Marilla	[MASK] thought it all rank foolishness. "It's just filling your heads up with nonsense and taking time that ought to be put on your lessons," she grumbled. "I don't approve of children's getting up concerts and racing about to practices.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	77448	77447	77501	Fudge	"[MASK]! There's precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any of you. All you want is a good time." "Well, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn't it all right? Of course it's real nice to be getting up a concert.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	77510	77463	77516	Diana	All you want is a good time." "Well, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn't it all right? Of course it's real nice to be getting up a concert. We're going to have six choruses and [MASK] is to sing a solo.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	77554	77536	77590	Marilla	The boys are going to have a dialogue too. And I'm to have two recitations, [MASK]. I just tremble when I think of it, but it's a nice thrilly kind of tremble. And we're to have a tableau at the last--?Faith, Hope and Charity.'
AnneOfGreenGables	45	77672	77628	77673	Marilla	I'm going to practice my recitations in the garret. Don't be alarmed if you hear me groaning. I have to groan heartrendingly in one of them, and it's really hard to get up a good artistic groan, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	42	78016	78016	78058	Anne	[MASK] perched herself on a block and talked the concert over with him, sure of an appreciative and sympathetic listener in this instance at least. "Well now, I reckon it's going to be a pretty good concert.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	78083	78043	78088	Anne	"Well now, I reckon it's going to be a pretty good concert. And I expect you'll do your part fine," he said, smiling down into her eager, vivacious little face. [MASK] smiled back at him.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	78154	78143	78197	Anne"--Marilla	As it was, he was free to, "spoil [MASK]'s phrasing--as much as he liked. But it was not such a bad arrangement after all; a little "appreciation" sometimes does quite as much good as all the conscientious "bringing up" in the world.
AnneOfGreenGables	59	78254	78216	78275	Anne	He had come into the kitchen, in the twilight of a cold, gray December evening, and had sat down in the woodbox corner to take off his heavy boots, unconscious of the fact that [MASK] and a bevy of her schoolmates were having a practice of "The Fairy Queen" in the sitting room.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	78298	78294	78348	Matthew	They did not see [MASK], who shrank bashfully back into the shadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in one hand and a bootjack in the other, and he watched them shyly for the aforesaid ten minutes as they put on caps and jackets and talked about the dialogue and the concert.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	78714	78682	78732	Marilla	He recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen around her that evening--all gay in waists of red and blue and pink and white--and he wondered why [MASK] always kept her so plainly and soberly gowned. Of course, it must be all right.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	78778	78778	78822	Matthew	[MASK] decided that he would give her one; that surely could not be objected to as an unwarranted putting in of his oar. Christmas was only a fortnight off. A nice new dress would be the very thing for a present.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	78893	78877	78923	Matthew	It would be, he felt assured, no trifling ordeal. There were some things [MASK] could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; but he knew he would be at the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl's dress.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	79029	78996	79042	Matthew	He could contrive to deal with them when he knew exactly what he wanted and could point it out; but in such a matter as this, requiring explanation and consultation, [MASK] felt that he must be sure of a man behind the counter.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	79147	79123	79170	Matthew	She was dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets that glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands. [MASK] was covered with confusion at finding her there at all; and those bangles completely wrecked his wits at one fell swoop.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	79282	79247	79290	Matthew	"I believe we have one or two left over," she said, "but they're upstairs in the lumber room. I'll go and see." During her absence [MASK] collected his scattered senses for another effort.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	79624	79577	79625	Marilla	It had been a gruesome experience, but it served him right, he thought, for committing the heresy of going to a strange store. When he reached home he hid the rake in the tool house, but the sugar he carried in to [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	50	79977	79966	80016	Matthew	"Well now, I'm much obliged," said [MASK], "and--and--I dunno--but I'd like--I think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what they used to be. If it wouldn't be asking too much I--
AnneOfGreenGables	57	80043	79987	80044	Matthew	but I'd like--I think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what they used to be. If it wouldn't be asking too much I--I'd like them made in the new way." "Puffs? Of course. You needn't worry a speck more about it, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	43	80125	80114	80157	Marilla	I've held my tongue though, for I can see [MASK] doesn't want advice and she thinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all she's an old maid. But that's always the way.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	80252	80240	80288	Anne	I suppose she's trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in [MASK] by dressing her as she does; but it's more likely to cultivate envy and discontent. I'm sure the child must feel the difference between her clothes and the other girls'.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	80293	80271	80312	Matthew	I'm sure the child must feel the difference between her clothes and the other girls'. But to think of [MASK] taking notice of it! That man is waking up after being asleep for over sixty years."
AnneOfGreenGables	42	80397	80392	80434	Matthew	"So this is what [MASK] has been looking so mysterious over and grinning about to himself for two weeks, is it?" she said a little stiffly but tolerantly. "I knew he was up to some foolishness.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	80444	80417	80469	Anne	she said a little stiffly but tolerantly. "I knew he was up to some foolishness. Well, I must say I don't think [MASK] needed any more dresses. I made her three good, warm, serviceable ones this fall, and anything more is sheer extravagance.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	80699	80696	80748	Matthew	Merry Christmas, [MASK]! Isn't it a lovely Christmas? I'm so glad it's white. Any other kind of Christmas doesn't seem real, does it? I don't like green Christmases. They're not green--they're just nasty faded browns and grays.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	80760	80716	80766	Matthew	Any other kind of Christmas doesn't seem real, does it? I don't like green Christmases. They're not green--they're just nasty faded browns and grays. What makes people call them green? Why--why--[MASK], is that for me?
AnneOfGreenGables	59	80820	80820	80879	Anne	[MASK] took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty it was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt with dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the most fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	81028	80988	81029	Marilla	Oh, I can never thank you enough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be a happy dream." "Well, well, let us have breakfast," interrupted [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	49	81106	81091	81140	Anne	"I don't see how I'm going to eat breakfast," said [MASK] rapturously. "Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment. I'd rather feast my eyes on that dress. I'm so glad that puffed sleeves are still fashionable.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	81264	81230	81284	Diana	But somehow it's hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistible temptations come. Still, I really will make an extra effort after this." When the commonplace breakfast was over [MASK] appeared, crossing the white log bridge in the hollow, a gay little figure in her crimson ulster.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	81800	81758	81809	Anne	I felt prouder than you did when it was encored. I just said to myself, ?It is my dear bosom friend who is so honored.'" "Well, your recitations just brought down the house, [MASK]. That sad one was simply splendid."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	81894	81871	81920	Diana	Then I thought of my lovely puffed sleeves and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves, [MASK]. So I started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so far away. I just felt like a parrot.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	81965	81914	81966	Diana	I just felt like a parrot. It's providential that I practiced those recitations so often up in the garret, or I'd never have been able to get through. Did I groan all right?" "Yes, indeed, you groaned lovely," assured [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	51	82031	81981	82032	Diana	It was splendid to think I had touched somebody's heart. It's so romantic to take part in a concert, isn't it? Oh, it's been a very memorable occasion indeed." "Wasn't the boys' dialogue fine?" said [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	53	82083	82061	82114	Gil	When you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue one of your roses fell out of your hair. I saw [MASK] pick it up and put it in his breast pocket. There now. You're so romantic that I'm sure you ought to be pleased at that."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	82257	82220	82270	Anne	And she looked real nice too. I've been kind of opposed to this concert scheme, but I suppose there's no real harm in it after all. Anyhow, I was proud of [MASK] tonight, although I'm not going to tell her so."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	82444	82409	82460	Matthew	But nothing need be said about that for a year or two yet." "Well now, it'll do no harm to be thinking it over off and on," said [MASK]. "Things like that are all the better for lots of thinking over."
AnneOfGreenGables	41	82483	82482	82523	Anne	To [MASK] in particular things seemed fearfully flat, stale, and unprofitable after the goblet of excitement she had been sipping for weeks. Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert?
AnneOfGreenGables	42	82546	82540	82582	Diana	"I'm positively certain, [MASK], that life can never be quite the same again as it was in those olden days," she said mournfully, as if referring to a period of at least fifty years back.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	83483	83431	83484	Diana	My besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties. I'm striving very hard to overcome it and now that I'm really thirteen perhaps I'll get on better." "In four more years we'll be able to put our hair up," said [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	50	83598	83566	83616	Diana	I'm afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I heard that compliment about it long ago. It really is a great comfort to me. Oh, [MASK], look, there's a rabbit. That's something to remember for our woods composition.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	83665	83617	83666	Diana	I really think the woods are just as lovely in winter as in summer. They're so white and still, as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams." "I won't mind writing that composition when its time comes," sighed [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	41	83817	83812	83853	Matthew	Then I read it to [MASK] and he said it was fine. That is the kind of critic I like. It's a sad, sweet story. I just cried like a child while I was writing it.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	83943	83935	83984	Geraldine	I wanted something out of the common. [MASK] had an alabaster brow too. I've found out what an alabaster brow is. That is one of the advantages of being thirteen. You know so much more than you did when you were only twelve."
AnneOfGreenGables	42	84188	84171	84213	Susan	What do you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?' And [MASK] said, ?Yes--no--I don't know--let me see'--and there they were, engaged as quick as that.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	84478	84471	84512	Geraldine	I will save thee, my peerless [MASK].' But alas, he had forgotten he couldn't swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each other's arms. Their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	84527	84481	84528	Diana	But alas, he had forgotten he couldn't swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each other's arms. Their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards. They were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	47	84549	84529	84576	Cordelia	It's so much more romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding. As for [MASK], she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum. I thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	84652	84643	84693	Diana	"I've just thought of a plan, [MASK]. Let you and me have a story club all our own and write stories for practice. I'll help you along until you can do them by yourself. You ought to cultivate your imagination, you know.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	85003	84988	85038	Marilla	"I think this story-writing business is the foolishest yet," scoffed [MASK]. "You'll get a pack of nonsense into your heads and waste time that should be put on your lessons. Reading stories is bad enough but writing them is worse."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	85361	85343	85392	Anne	"No; but she wasn't always so good as she is now either," said [MASK] seriously. "She told me so herself--that is, she said she was a dreadful mischief when she was a girl and was always getting into scrapes.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	86018	86011	86057	Diana	"She's gadding off somewhere with [MASK], writing stories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery, and never thinking once about the time or her duties. She's just got to be pulled up short and sudden on this sort of thing.
AnneOfGreenGables	58	86229	86225	86283	Anne	Just the same, [MASK] has no business to leave the house like this when I told her she was to stay home this afternoon and look after things. I must say, with all her faults, I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and I'm real sorry to find her so now."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	86607	86601	86650	Marilla	"No. But please, [MASK], go away and don't look at me. I'm in the depths of despair and I don't care who gets head in class or writes the best composition or sings in the Sunday-school choir any more.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	86682	86651	86702	Marilla	Little things like that are of no importance now because I don't suppose I'll ever be able to go anywhere again. My career is closed. Please, [MASK], go away and don't look at me." "Did anyone ever hear the like?"
AnneOfGreenGables	45	86948	86928	86973	Marilla	"I little know how you got into this fix, but I mean to find out," said [MASK]. "Come right down to the kitchen--it's too cold up here--and tell me just what you've done.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	87088	87063	87107	Marilla	"But I thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair. I counted the cost, [MASK]. Besides, I meant to be extra good in other ways to make up for it."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	87113	87090	87139	Marilla	Besides, I meant to be extra good in other ways to make up for it." "Well," said [MASK] sarcastically, "if I'd decided it was worth while to dye my hair I'd have dyed it a decent color at least.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	87208	87167	87221	Marilla	"If I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose. He said it would turn my hair a beautiful raven black--he positively assured me that it would. How could I doubt his word, [MASK]? I know what it feels like to have your word doubted.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	87598	87588	87629	Marilla	I used up the whole bottle, and oh, [MASK], when I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being wicked, I can tell you. And I've been repenting ever since."
AnneOfGreenGables	55	87699	87674	87729	Anne	I suppose the first thing is to give your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good." Accordingly, [MASK] washed her hair, scrubbing it vigorously with soap and water, but for all the difference it made she might as well have been scouring its original red.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	87824	87807	87849	Marilla	But they'll never forget this. They will think I am not respectable. Oh, [MASK], ?what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.' That is poetry, but it is true.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	87902	87889	87932	Diana	During that time she went nowhere and shampooed her hair every day. [MASK] alone of outsiders knew the fatal secret, but she promised solemnly never to tell, and it may be stated here and now that she kept her word.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	88020	88002	88043	Marilla	With a dismal sigh she went for the scissors. "Please cut it off at once, [MASK], and have it over. Oh, I feel that my heart is broken. This is such an unromantic affliction.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	88134	88106	88157	Anne	I'm going to weep all the time you're cutting it off, if it won't interfere. It seems such a tragic thing." [MASK] wept then, but later on, when she went upstairs and looked in the glass, she was calm with despair.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	88194	88178	88229	Anne	The result was not becoming, to state the case as mildly as may be. [MASK] promptly turned her glass to the wall. "I'll never, never look at myself again until my hair grows," she exclaimed passionately. Then she suddenly righted the glass.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	88561	88561	88606	Diana	[MASK] says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side. She says she thinks it will be very becoming. I will call it a snood--that sounds so romantic.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	88614	88607	88658	Marilla	But am I talking too much, [MASK]? Does it hurt your head?" "My head is better now. It was terrible bad this afternoon, though. These headaches of mine are getting worse and worse. I'll have to see a doctor about them.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	88683	88649	88697	Marilla	I'll have to see a doctor about them. As for your chatter, I don't know that I mind it--I've got so used to it." Which was [MASK]'s way of saying that she liked to hear it. CHAPTER XXVIII.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	88995	88984	89027	Anne	"Oh, do you really think so?" exclaimed [MASK], flushing sensitively with delight. "I've sometimes thought it was myself--but I never dared to ask anyone for fear she would tell me it wasn't.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	89423	89423	89474	Anne	[MASK]'s plan was hailed with enthusiasm. The girls had discovered that if the flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down with the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another headland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	89620	89570	89622	Diana	We can't have the old dumb servitor because there isn't room for two in the flat when one is lying down. We must pall the barge all its length in blackest samite. That old black shawl of your mother's will be just the thing, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	54	89821	89777	89831	Anne	Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none, but an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent substitute. A white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in one of [MASK]'s folded hands was all that could be desired.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	90040	90031	90079	Elaine	In a very few moments it was necessary for [MASK] to scramble to her feet, pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall of blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her barge through which the water was literally pouring.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	90098	90098	90150	Anne	[MASK] did not know this, but it did not take her long to realize that she was in a dangerous plight. At this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland. Where were the oars? Left behind at the landing!
AnneOfGreenGables	46	90151	90140	90186	Anne	Where were the oars? Left behind at the landing! [MASK] gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard; she was white to the lips, but she did not lose her self-possession. There was one chance--just one.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	90620	90620	90670	Help	[MASK] would soon come, but meanwhile her position was a very uncomfortable one. The minutes passed by, each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid. Why didn't somebody come? Where had the girls gone? Suppose they had fainted, one and all!
AnneOfGreenGables	47	91013	91012	91059	Anne	"[MASK]," he said hurriedly, "look here. Can't we be good friends? I'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time. I didn't mean to vex you and I only meant it for a joke.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	91090	91044	91092	Anne	I didn't mean to vex you and I only meant it for a joke. Besides, it's so long ago. I think your hair is awfully pretty now--honest I do. Let's be friends." For a moment [MASK] hesitated.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	91117	91093	91139	Gilbert	She had an odd, newly awakened consciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half-shy, half-eager expression in [MASK]'s hazel eyes was something that was very good to see. Her heart gave a quick, queer little beat.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	91175	91140	91192	Gilbert	But the bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering determination. That scene of two years before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday. [MASK] had called her "carrots" and had brought about her disgrace before the whole school.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	91310	91293	91340	Anne	And I don't care either!" He pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and [MASK] went up the steep, ferny little path under the maples. She held her head very high, but she was conscious of an odd feeling of regret.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	91364	91350	91400	Anne	Of course, he had insulted her terribly, but still--! Altogether, [MASK] rather thought it would be a relief to sit down and have a good cry. She was really quite unstrung, for the reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	91651	91630	91673	Anne	"Of course you'll speak to him after this." "Of course I won't," flashed [MASK], with a momentary return of her old spirit. "And I don't want ever to hear the word ?
AnneOfGreenGables	55	91732	91698	91753	Diana	I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star. Everything I do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape. We've gone and lost your father's flat, [MASK], and I have a presentiment that we'll not be allowed to row on the pond any more."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	91867	91817	91868	Marilla	A good cry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed her nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness. "I think my prospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever." "I don't see how," said [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	53	92413	92393	92446	Diana	But betray too eager curiosity she would not. "Isn't this evening just like a purple dream, [MASK]? It makes me so glad to be alive. In the mornings I always think the mornings are best; but when evening comes I think it's lovelier still."
AnneOfGreenGables	44	92457	92415	92459	Diana	It makes me so glad to be alive. In the mornings I always think the mornings are best; but when evening comes I think it's lovelier still." "It's a very fine evening," said [MASK], "
AnneOfGreenGables	50	92508	92505	92555	Charlotte	"No. [MASK]'s beau won't agree to that, because nobody ever has been married in the church yet, and he thinks it would seem too much like a funeral. It's too mean, because it would be such fun. Guess again."
AnneOfGreenGables	41	92749	92730	92771	Jane	She will say that she can't encourage gadding about. That was what she said last week when [MASK] invited me to go with them in their double-seated buggy to the American concert at the White Sands Hotel.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	92799	92794	92836	Diana	I was bitterly disappointed, [MASK]. I felt so heartbroken that I wouldn't say my prayers when I went to bed. But I repented of that and got up in the middle of the night and said them."
AnneOfGreenGables	48	92880	92856	92904	Anne	She'll be more likely to let you go then; and if she does we'll have the time of our lives, [MASK]. I've never been to an Exhibition, and it's so aggravating to hear the other girls talking about their trips.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	92944	92921	92964	Anne	"I'm not going to think about it at all until I know whether I can go or not," said [MASK] resolutely. "If I did and then was disappointed, it would be more than I could bear.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	92985	92947	92994	Marilla	"If I did and then was disappointed, it would be more than I could bear. But in case I do go I'm very glad my new coat will be ready by that time. [MASK] didn't think I needed a new coat.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	93238	93232	93281	Diana	Your new hat is elegant, [MASK], and so becoming. When I saw you come into church last Sunday my heart swelled with pride to think you were my dearest friend. Do you suppose it's wrong for us to think so much about our clothes?
AnneOfGreenGables	44	93282	93244	93288	Marilla	When I saw you come into church last Sunday my heart swelled with pride to think you were my dearest friend. Do you suppose it's wrong for us to think so much about our clothes? [MASK] says it is very sinful.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	93736	93735	93782	Mercy	"[MASK], child, how you have grown! You're taller than I am, I declare. And you're ever so much better looking than you used to be, too. But I dare say you know that without being told."
AnneOfGreenGables	48	93791	93745	93793	Anne	You're taller than I am, I declare. And you're ever so much better looking than you used to be, too. But I dare say you know that without being told." "Indeed I didn't," said [MASK] radiantly.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	93965	93958	94003	Diana	I've dreamed of such things, [MASK]. But do you know I don't believe I feel very comfortable with them after all. There are so many things in this room and all so splendid that there is no scope for imagination.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	94181	94181	94227	Diana	[MASK] said she thought it was ridiculous for a Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs, but I don't see why. Do you? She said she would always think of it after this when he was praying so solemnly.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	94399	94373	94417	Diana	I don't think, though, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they _are_ awfully fascinating. [MASK] got so excited that she offered to bet me ten cents that the red horse would win.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	94546	94526	94577	Marilla	We saw a man go up in a balloon. I'd love to go up in a balloon, [MASK]; it would be simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. You paid him ten cents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	94672	94618	94673	Marilla	I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after that, but I didn't care much for any of them, and anyhow I suppose it's too early to be looking out for him yet. Oh, it was a never-to-be-forgotten day, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	45	95095	95067	95112	Marilla	So I thought it over after I went to bed. That is the best time to think things out. And I came to the conclusion, [MASK], that I wasn't born for city life and that I was glad of it.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	95695	95650	95696	Anne	The waves broke with a soft swish on the rocks below them, and the tang of the sea was in the strong, fresh air. "Oh, but it's good to be alive and to be going home," breathed [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	49	95869	95854	95903	Matthew	Hurry and take off your things, and we'll have supper as soon as [MASK] comes in. I'm glad you've got back, I must say. It's been fearful lonesome here without you, and I never put in four longer days."
AnneOfGreenGables	58	96056	96056	96114	Anne	[MASK] was curled up Turk-fashion on the hearthrug, gazing into that joyous glow where the sunshine of a hundred summers was being distilled from the maple cordwood. She had been reading, but her book had slipped to the floor, and now she was dreaming, with a smile on her parted lips.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	96209	96191	96239	Marilla	The lesson of a love that should display itself easily in spoken word and open look was one [MASK] could never learn. But she had learned to love this slim, gray-eyed girl with an affection all the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness.
AnneOfGreenGables	56	96279	96252	96308	Anne	She had an uneasy feeling that it was rather sinful to set one's heart so intensely on any human creature as she had set hers on [MASK], and perhaps she performed a sort of unconscious penance for this by being stricter and more critical than if the girl had been less dear to her.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	96415	96415	96470	Diana	[MASK] and I were only over in the Haunted Wood. It's lovely in the woods now. All the little wood things--the ferns and the satin leaves and the crackerberries--have gone to sleep, just as if somebody had tucked them away until spring under a blanket of leaves.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	96617	96593	96641	Diana	Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn't do to drag them into everything, does it? [MASK] and I are thinking seriously of promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids and live together forever.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	96830	96825	96874	Marilla	We felt extremely solemn, [MASK]. And we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and form respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as possible, so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be properly developed.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	96885	96832	96886	Marilla	And we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and form respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as possible, so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be properly developed. It's perfectly appalling to think of being twenty, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	59	97255	97205	97264	Marilla	First, I was wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly, I was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a history when it was a storybook instead. I had never realized until that moment, [MASK], that what I was doing was deceitful.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	97792	97739	97794	Marilla	I know I talk too much, but I am really trying to overcome it, and although I say far too much, yet if you only knew how many things I want to say and don't, you'd give me some credit for it. Please tell me, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	46	98000	97999	98045	Matthew	When [MASK] and I took you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you and give you a good education. I believe in a girl being fitted to earn her own living whether she ever has to or not.
AnneOfGreenGables	57	98135	98127	98184	Matthew	"I'm extremely grateful to you and [MASK]. And I'll study as hard as I can and do my very best to be a credit to you. I warn you not to expect much in geometry, but I think I can hold my own in anything else if I work hard."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	98728	98728	98777	Jane	[MASK] says she will devote her whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a husband won't pay you anything, and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	100013	99988	100043	Anne	I don't believe I could have the heart to go on with my studies at all if another teacher came here." When [MASK] got home that night she stacked all her textbooks away in an old trunk in the attic, locked it, and threw the key into the blanket box.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	100134	100126	100173	Marilla	Oh, you needn't be alarmed, [MASK]. I'll only let it run riot within reasonable limits. But I want to have a real good jolly time this summer, for maybe it's the last summer I'll be a little girl.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	100668	100662	100710	Marilla	"She is," said [MASK], "and she's real steady and reliable now. I used to be afraid she'd never get over her featherbrained ways, but she has and I wouldn't be afraid to trust her in anything now."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	100809	100787	100836	Marilla	But I was mistaken and I'm real glad of it. I ain't one of those kind of people, [MASK], as can never be brought to own up that they've made a mistake. No, that never was my way, thank goodness.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	100844	100837	100887	Anne	I did make a mistake in judging [MASK], but it weren't no wonder, for an odder, unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in this world, that's what. There was no ciphering her out by the rules that worked with other children.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	100971	100969	101019	Anne	but when [MASK] and them are together, though she ain't half as handsome, she makes them look kind of common and overdone--something like them white June lilies she calls narcissus alongside of the big, red peonies, that's what." CHAPTER XXXI.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	101219	101202	101249	September	She walked, rowed, berried, and dreamed to her heart's content; and when [MASK] came she was bright-eyed and alert, with a step that would have satisfied the Spencervale doctor and a heart full of ambition and zest once more.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	101462	101411	101463	Marilla	If I were a man I think I'd be a minister. They can have such an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be thrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers' hearts. Why can't women be ministers, [MASK]?
AnneOfGreenGables	46	101795	101759	101805	Marilla	I feel irresistibly tempted to do it. Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you think it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate?" [MASK] looked dubious for a moment. Then she laughed.
AnneOfGreenGables	58	101876	101828	101886	Rachel	I sometimes think she'd have more of an influence for good, as you say yourself, if she didn't keep nagging people to do right. There should have been a special commandment against nagging. But there, I shouldn't talk so. [MASK] is a good Christian woman and she means well.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	101917	101905	101949	Anne	"I'm very glad you feel the same," said [MASK] decidedly. "It's so encouraging. I shan't worry so much over that after this. But I dare say there'll be other things to worry me.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	102026	101978	102027	Marilla	There are so many things to be thought over and decided when you're beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right. It's a serious thing to grow up, isn't it, [MASK]?
AnneOfGreenGables	41	102107	102067	102108	Marilla	I feel it's a great responsibility because I have only the one chance. If I don't grow up right I can't go back and begin over again. I've grown two inches this summer, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	42	102217	102176	102218	Marilla	I know I'll be able to study better because of mine. I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my mind about that flounce." "It's worth something to have that," admitted [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	41	102858	102840	102881	Marilla	"It won't be the same thing as having her here all the time," sighed [MASK] gloomily, determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted. "But there--men can't understand these things!"
AnneOfGreenGables	52	102887	102871	102923	Anne	But there--men can't understand these things!" There were other changes in [MASK] no less real than the physical change. For one thing, she became much quieter. Perhaps she thought all the more and dreamed as much as ever, but she certainly talked less.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	102962	102955	103002	Anne	What has come over you?" [MASK] colored and laughed a little, as she dropped her book and looked dreamily out of the window, where big fat red buds were bursting out on the creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	103127	103077	103128	Marilla	It's almost a pity, isn't it, now that I'm really growing big enough to say them if I did want to. It's fun to be almost grown up in some ways, but it's not the kind of fun I expected, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	51	103605	103571	103622	Marilla	Sometimes I wake up in the night and wonder what I'll do if I don't pass." "Why, go to school next year and try again," said [MASK] unconcernedly. "Oh, I don't believe I'd have the heart for it.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	103634	103608	103659	Gil	"Oh, I don't believe I'd have the heart for it. It would be such a disgrace to fail, especially if [MASK]--if the others passed. And I get so nervous in an examination that I'm likely to make a mess of it.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	103674	103669	103712	Anne	Nothing rattles her." [MASK] sighed and, dragging her eyes from the witcheries of the spring world, the beckoning day of breeze and blue, and the green things upspringing in the garden, buried herself resolutely in her book.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	103876	103839	103887	Anne	"It does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn't it?" she said dismally. "You oughtn't to feel half as badly as I do," said [MASK], hunting vainly for a dry spot on her handkerchief.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	103976	103944	103988	Anne	I shall have to sit all alone, for I couldn't bear to have another deskmate after you. Oh, we have had jolly times, haven't we, [MASK]? It's dreadful to think they're all over."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	104195	104157	104206	Diana	I am _not_ superstitious and I know it can make no difference. But still I wish it wasn't thirteen." "I do wish I was going in with you," said [MASK]. "Wouldn't we have a perfectly elegant time?
AnneOfGreenGables	47	104767	104755	104802	Jane	No need of the multiplication table for good, steady, sensible [MASK]! I wondered if I looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear across the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English examination sheets.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	104934	104931	104982	Diana	But oh, [MASK], tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it it takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my Euclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would recite it from now till tomorrow morning.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	105108	105107	105154	Ruby	"[MASK] was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just discovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When she recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had been with us."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	105305	105277	105326	Anne	"You old darling, it's perfectly splendid to see you back again. It seems like an age since you went to town and oh, [MASK], how did you get along?" "Pretty well, I think, in everything but the geometry.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	105401	105374	105415	Josie	"How did the others do?" "The girls say they know they didn't pass, but I think they did pretty well. [MASK] says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it!
AnneOfGreenGables	57	105797	105776	105833	Matthew	But she did hope fervently that she would be among the first ten at least, so that she might see [MASK]'s kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement. That, she felt, would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient grubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	105924	105902	105947	Anne	"I haven't got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood," he told [MASK]. "I'm just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me suddenly whether I've passed or not."
AnneOfGreenGables	47	105959	105926	105973	Anne	"I'm just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me suddenly whether I've passed or not." When three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing [MASK] began to feel that she really couldn't stand the strain much longer.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	106215	106183	106235	Diana	The pass list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt her. She could not move a step. It seemed an hour to her before [MASK] came rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even knocking, so great was her excitement.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	106296	106296	106348	Anne	[MASK] lighted the lamp, oversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her shaking hands could accomplish the task. Then she snatched up the paper. Yes, she had passed--there was her name at the very top of a list of two hundred!
AnneOfGreenGables	56	106515	106513	106569	Anne	Oh, [MASK], what does it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were me I know I'd go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but you're as calm and cool as a spring evening.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	106580	106549	106601	Anne	I am pretty near crazy as it is, but you're as calm and cool as a spring evening." "I'm just dazzled inside," said [MASK]. "I want to say a hundred things, and I can't find words to say them in.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	106770	106748	106789	Matthew	I'm not vain, but I'm thankful." "Well now, I always said it," said [MASK], gazing at the pass list delightedly. "I knew you could beat them all easy."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	106859	106822	106873	Anne	But that good soul said heartily: "I just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in saying it. You're a credit to your friends, [MASK], that's what, and we're all proud of you."
AnneOfGreenGables	41	107622	107609	107650	Anne	"Do you really think the organdy will be best?" queried [MASK] anxiously. "I don't think it's as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it certainly isn't so fashionable." "
AnneOfGreenGables	48	107662	107625	107673	Diana	"I don't think it's as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it certainly isn't so fashionable." "But it suits you ever so much better," said [MASK]. "It's so soft and frilly and clinging.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	107751	107728	107775	Anne	She was looking very pretty herself on this particular night in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which [MASK] was forever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so her appearance was of minor importance.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	107944	107904	107946	Anne	I shall fasten this little white house rose just behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for you." "Shall I put my pearl beads on?" asked [MASK]. "
AnneOfGreenGables	48	108089	108065	108113	Anne	Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign myself to it." "But you have such dimples," said [MASK], smiling affectionately into the pretty, vivacious face so near her own. "Lovely dimples, like little dents in cream.
AnneOfGreenGables	56	108207	108207	108263	Marilla	[MASK] emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt. "She looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I expect she'll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	108540	108515	108569	Diana	It's new every morning, and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of earliest sunshine. Oh, [MASK], I love this little room so dearly. I don't know how I'll get along without it when I go to town next month."
AnneOfGreenGables	41	108582	108570	108611	Diana	"Don't speak of your going away tonight," begged [MASK]. "I don't want to think of it, it makes me so miserable, and I do want to have a good time this evening.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	108619	108612	108663	Anne	What are you going to recite, [MASK]? And are you nervous?" "Not a bit. I've recited so often in public I don't mind at all now. I've decided to give ?The Maiden's Vow.' It's so pathetic.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	109092	109055	109106	Anne	What were her pearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big, handsome lady near her? And how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse flowers the others wore! [MASK] laid her hat and jacket away, and shrank miserably into a corner.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	109371	109351	109404	Anne	She had a marvelously flexible voice and wonderful power of expression; the audience went wild over her selection. [MASK], forgetting all about herself and her troubles for the time, listened with rapt and shining eyes; but when the recitation ended she suddenly put her hands over her face.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	109952	109942	109992	Anne	When she finished there were bursts of honest applause. [MASK], stepping back to her seat, blushing with shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken by the stout lady in pink silk. "My dear, you did splendidly," she puffed.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	110031	109981	110033	Anne	"My dear, you did splendidly," she puffed. "I've been crying like a baby, actually I have. There, they're encoring you--they're bound to have you back!" "Oh, I can't go," said [MASK] confusedly.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	110274	110240	110291	Anne	He was in waiting for them, with the team, however, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into the calm, white moonshine radiance. [MASK] breathed deeply, and looked into the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	110352	110310	110358	Jane	How great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the sea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants guarding enchanted coasts. "Hasn't it been a perfectly splendid time?" sighed [MASK], as they drove away.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	110558	110527	110576	Jane	"At least I think it must be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part of it was anyhow. There was an American sitting behind [MASK] and me--such a romantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	110731	110710	110762	Anne	Wouldn't you just love to be rich, girls?" "We _are_ rich," said [MASK] staunchly. "Why, we have sixteen years to our credit, and we're happy as queens, and we've all got imaginations, more or less.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	110966	110926	110967	Anne	"I think diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal." "Well, I don't want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by diamonds all my life," declared [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	52	111304	111256	111308	Emily	"Thank you so much. I don't believe you ought to be so kind to me--it's making it harder every day for me to go away." The green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as [MASK]'s taste permitted.
AnneOfGreenGables	59	111758	111758	111817	Matthew	[MASK], with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went out-of-doors. Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars. "Well now, I guess she ain't been much spoiled," he muttered, proudly.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	112104	112104	112156	Anne	[MASK] and the rest of the Avonlea scholars reached town just in time to hurry off to the Academy. That first day passed pleasantly enough in a whirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the professors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes.
AnneOfGreenGables	58	112244	112244	112302	Anne	[MASK] was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in a room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the tall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion she did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	112326	112303	112352	Anne	Yet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old rivalry could still be carried on, and [MASK] would hardly have known what to do if it had been lacking. "I wouldn't feel comfortable without it," she thought.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	112354	112340	112389	Gilbert	"I wouldn't feel comfortable without it," she thought. "[MASK] looks awfully determined. I suppose he's making up his mind, here and now, to win the medal. What a splendid chin he has! I never noticed it before.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	112452	112441	112489	Diana	It's really an interesting speculation. Of course I promised [MASK] that no Queen's girl, no matter how much I liked her, should ever be as dear to me as she is; but I've lots of second-best affections to bestow.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	112610	112573	112622	Anne	But just now I don't know them and they don't know me, and probably don't want to know me particularly. Oh, it's lonesome!" It was lonesomer still when [MASK] found herself alone in her hall bedroom that night at twilight.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	112730	112710	112760	Anne	"Her husband was a British officer, and she is very careful what sort of boarders she takes. [MASK] will not meet with any objectionable persons under her roof. The table is good, and the house is near the Academy, in a quiet neighborhood."
AnneOfGreenGables	51	112782	112742	112793	Anne	The table is good, and the house is near the Academy, in a quiet neighborhood." All this might be quite true, and indeed, proved to be so, but it did not materially help [MASK] in the first agony of homesickness that seized upon her.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	112918	112911	112955	Anne	Here there was nothing of this; [MASK] knew that outside of her window was a hard street, with a network of telephone wires shutting out the sky, the tramp of alien feet, and a thousand lights gleaming on stranger faces.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	113196	113188	113233	Josie	"You've been crying," remarked [MASK], with aggravating pity. "I suppose you're homesick--some people have so little self-control in that respect. I've no intention of being homesick, I can tell you.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	113259	113244	113293	Anne	I wonder how I ever existed there so long. You shouldn't cry, [MASK]; it isn't becoming, for your nose and eyes get red, and then you seem _all_ red. I'd a perfectly scrumptious time in the Academy today.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	113318	113283	113324	Anne	I'd a perfectly scrumptious time in the Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck. His moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything eatable around, [MASK]? I'm literally starving.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	113492	113487	113533	Jane	"Well," said [MASK] with a sigh, "I feel as if I'd lived many moons since the morning. I ought to be home studying my Virgil--that horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	113545	113511	113565	Anne	I ought to be home studying my Virgil--that horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow. But I simply couldn't settle down to study tonight. [MASK], methinks I see the traces of tears. If you've been crying _do_ own up.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	113581	113555	113601	Ruby	If you've been crying _do_ own up. It will restore my self-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before [MASK] came along. I don't mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey, too.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	113977	113974	114024	Matthew	"Wouldn't [MASK] be proud if I got to be a B.A.? Oh, it's delightful to have ambitions. I'm so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to be any end to them--that's the best of it.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	114175	114175	114226	Ruby	[MASK] was a very handsome young lady, now thinking herself quite as grown up as she really was; she wore her skirts as long as her mother would let her and did her hair up in town, though she had to take it down when she went home.
AnneOfGreenGables	41	114403	114382	114423	Gilbert	Boys were to her, when she thought about them at all, merely possible good comrades. If she and [MASK] had been friends she would not have cared how many other friends he had nor with whom he walked.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	114492	114487	114538	Gilbert	But she thought that if [MASK] had ever walked home with her from the train, over the crisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening around them and their hopes and ambitions therein.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	115177	115141	115191	Anne	The latter was, as she admitted, growing old, but her black eyes were not dim nor the vigor of her tongue in the least abated. But she never sharpened the latter on [MASK], who continued to be a prime favorite with the critical old lady.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	115225	115225	115276	Anne	[MASK] has as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest while it lasts. I don't know that she is as amusing as she was when she was a child, but she makes me love her and I like people who make me love them.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	115366	115351	115402	Anne	"It doesn't seem possible that the term is nearly over," said [MASK]. "Why, last fall it seemed so long to look forward to--a whole winter of studies and classes. And here we are, with the exams looming up next week.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	115494	115488	115535	Anne	It was all very well for [MASK], who was sure of passing at least, to have her moments of belittling them, but when your whole future depended on them--as the girls truly thought theirs did--you could not regard them philosophically.
AnneOfGreenGables	59	115861	115860	115919	Anne	But [MASK], with her elbows on the window sill, her soft cheek laid against her clasped hands, and her eyes filled with visions, looked out unheedingly across city roof and spire to that glorious dome of sunset sky and wove her dreams of a possible future from the golden tissue of youth's own optimism.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	116137	116104	116155	Jane	Beyond those ten minutes there did not seem, just then, to be anything worth being called Time. "Of course you'll win one of them anyhow," said [MASK], who couldn't understand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it otherwise.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	116227	116178	116228	Jane	And I'm not going to march up to that bulletin board and look at it before everybody. I haven't the moral courage. I'm going straight to the girls' dressing room. You must read the announcements and then come and tell me, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	52	116279	116229	116281	Jane	And I implore you in the name of our old friendship to do it as quickly as possible. If I have failed just say so, without trying to break it gently; and whatever you do _don't_ sympathize with me. Promise me this, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	48	116786	116783	116831	Diana	"Oh, [MASK], it's so good to be back again. It's so good to see those pointed firs coming out against the pink sky--and that white orchard and the old Snow Queen. Isn't the breath of the mint delicious?
AnneOfGreenGables	43	116864	116823	116866	Diana	Isn't the breath of the mint delicious? And that tea rose--why, it's a song and a hope and a prayer all in one. And it's _good_ to see you again, [MASK]!"
AnneOfGreenGables	43	117022	116980	117023	Anne	I'm tired, I think--tired of being studious and ambitious. I mean to spend at least two hours tomorrow lying out in the orchard grass, thinking of absolutely nothing." "You've done splendidly, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	52	117298	117289	117341	Marilla	"No, he isn't," said [MASK] in a troubled tone. "He's had some real bad spells with his heart this spring and he won't spare himself a mite. I've been real worried about him, but he's some better this while back
AnneOfGreenGables	43	117409	117393	117436	Marilla	"You are not looking as well yourself as I'd like to see you, [MASK]. You look tired. I'm afraid you've been working too hard. You must take a rest, now that I'm home.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	117478	117437	117484	Marilla	I'm just going to take this one day off to visit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams, and then it will be your turn to be lazy while I do the work." [MASK] smiled affectionately at her girl.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	118092	118079	118131	Anne	"If I had been the boy you sent for," said [MASK] wistfully, "I'd be able to help you so much now and spare you in a hundred ways. I could find it in my heart to wish I had been, just for that."
AnneOfGreenGables	49	118180	118167	118216	Avery	Well now, I guess it wasn't a boy that took the [MASK] scholarship, was it? It was a girl--my girl--my girl that I'm proud of." He smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	118217	118203	118253	Anne	He smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard. [MASK] took the memory of it with her when she went to her room that night and sat for a long while at her open window, thinking of the past and dreaming of the future.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	118276	118276	118326	Anne	[MASK] always remembered the silvery, peaceful beauty and fragrant calm of that night. It was the last night before sorrow touched her life; and no life is ever quite the same again when once that cold, sanctifying touch has been laid upon it. CHAPTER XXXVII.
AnneOfGreenGables	58	118670	118651	118709	Anne	When you've seen that look as often as I have you'll know what it means." [MASK] looked at the still face and there beheld the seal of the Great Presence. When the doctor came he said that death had been instantaneous and probably painless, caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	118987	118987	119034	Anne	[MASK] looked earnestly into her friend's face. "I think you won't misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone. I'm not afraid. I haven't been alone one minute since it happened--and I want to be.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	119063	119049	119097	Matthew	I can't realize it. Half the time it seems to me that [MASK] can't be dead; and the other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and I've had this horrible dull ache ever since."
AnneOfGreenGables	42	119312	119309	119351	Matthew	She could see [MASK]'s face smiling at her as he had smiled when they parted at the gate that last evening--she could hear his voice saying, "My girl--my girl that I'm proud of."
AnneOfGreenGables	50	119363	119363	119413	Marilla	[MASK] heard her and crept in to comfort her. "There--there--don't cry so, dearie. It can't bring him back. It--it--isn't right to cry so. I knew that today, but I couldn't help it then.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	119480	119476	119525	Diana	I couldn't have [MASK] stay, she's good and kind and sweet--but it's not her sorrow--she's outside of it and she couldn't come close enough to my heart to help me. It's our sorrow--yours and mine.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	120250	120211	120261	Marilla	I hope he has roses like them in heaven. Perhaps the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many summers were all there to meet him. I must go home now. [MASK] is all alone and she gets lonely at twilight."
AnneOfGreenGables	41	120344	120318	120359	Anne	The door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions. [MASK] gathered some sprays of pale-yellow honeysuckle and put them in her hair.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	120467	120430	120483	Martin	I'll be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind of glasses to suit my eyes. You won't mind staying here alone while I'm away, will you? [MASK] will have to drive me in and there's ironing and baking to do."
AnneOfGreenGables	43	120491	120484	120527	Diana	"I shall be all right. [MASK] will come over for company for me. I shall attend to the ironing and baking beautifully--you needn't fear that I'll starch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment."
AnneOfGreenGables	46	120544	120531	120577	Anne	"What a girl you were for making mistakes in them days, [MASK]. You were always getting into scrapes. I did use to think you were possessed. Do you mind the time you dyed your hair?" "Yes, indeed.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	120586	120553	120601	Anne	I did use to think you were possessed. Do you mind the time you dyed your hair?" "Yes, indeed. I shall never forget it," smiled [MASK], touching the heavy braid of hair that was wound about her shapely head.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	120816	120781	120834	Josie	I suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in society, but I must say I don't know what it is any more than I know the use of thistles. Is [MASK] going to teach?" "No, she is going back to Queen's next year.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	120898	120883	120929	Marilla	"Yes"--briefly. "What a nice-looking fellow he is," said [MASK] absently. "I saw him in church last Sunday and he seemed so tall and manly. He looks a lot like his father did at the same age.
AnneOfGreenGables	49	120965	120962	121011	Marilla	"Oh, [MASK]--and what happened?--why didn't you--" "We had a quarrel. I wouldn't forgive him when he asked me to. I meant to, after awhile--but I was sulky and angry and I wanted to punish him first.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	121066	121032	121079	Anne	I've always kind of wished I'd forgiven him when I had the chance." "So you've had a bit of romance in your life, too," said [MASK] softly. "Yes, I suppose you might call it that.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	121110	121069	121116	John	"Yes, I suppose you might call it that. You wouldn't think so to look at me, would you? But you never can tell about people from their outsides. Everybody has forgot about me and [MASK]. I'd forgotten myself.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	121229	121217	121261	Marilla	"Yes--no--I don't know," said [MASK] wearily, looking up. "I suppose I am tired but I haven't thought about it. It's not that." "Did you see the oculist?
AnneOfGreenGables	48	121269	121235	121283	Anne	"I suppose I am tired but I haven't thought about it. It's not that." "Did you see the oculist? What did he say?" asked [MASK] anxiously. "Yes, I saw him. He examined my eyes.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	121411	121385	121428	Marilla	It seemed to her that she could _not_ speak. Then she said bravely, but with a catch in her voice: "[MASK], _don't_ think of it. You know he has given you hope.
AnneOfGreenGables	48	121467	121421	121469	Marilla	You know he has given you hope. If you are careful you won't lose your sight altogether; and if his glasses cure your headaches it will be a great thing." "I don't call it much hope," said [MASK] bitterly.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	121596	121595	121637	Anne	Then [MASK] went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the darkness alone with her tears and her heaviness of heart. How sadly things had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home!
AnneOfGreenGables	47	121656	121638	121685	Anne	Then she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy with promise. [MASK] felt as if she had lived years since then, but before she went to bed there was a smile on her lips and peace in her heart.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	121857	121856	121909	Anne	"[MASK], I don't know what else is to be done. I've thought it all over. If my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after things and manage, with a good hired man. But as it is I can't.
AnneOfGreenGables	42	121985	121949	121991	Matthew	But things would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till nobody would want to buy it. Every cent of our money went in that bank; and there's some notes [MASK] gave last fall to pay.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	122048	122024	122078	Anne	But it'll be enough for me to live on I reckon. I'm thankful you're provided for with that scholarship, [MASK]. I'm sorry you won't have a home to come to in your vacations, that's all, but I suppose you'll manage somehow."
AnneOfGreenGables	47	122102	122099	122146	Anne	"Oh, [MASK], I wish I didn't have to. But you can see for yourself. I can't stay here alone. I'd go crazy with trouble and loneliness. And my sight would go--I know it would."
AnneOfGreenGables	52	122157	122112	122164	Marilla	But you can see for yourself. I can't stay here alone. I'd go crazy with trouble and loneliness. And my sight would go--I know it would." "You won't have to stay here alone, [MASK]. I'll be with you.
AnneOfGreenGables	50	122243	122202	122252	Marilla	"Just what I say. I'm not going to take the scholarship. I decided so the night after you came home from town. You surely don't think I could leave you alone in your trouble, [MASK], after all you've done for me.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	122409	122392	122444	Marilla	We'll keep a horse for that. Oh, I have it all planned out, [MASK]. And I'll read to you and keep you cheered up. You sha'n't be dull or lonesome. And we'll be real cozy and happy here together, you and I."
AnneOfGreenGables	43	122445	122411	122454	Marilla	And I'll read to you and keep you cheered up. You sha'n't be dull or lonesome. And we'll be real cozy and happy here together, you and I." [MASK] had listened like a woman in a dream.
AnneOfGreenGables	46	122642	122597	122643	Marilla	I'm going to be a good teacher--and I'm going to save your eyesight. Besides, I mean to study at home here and take a little college course all by myself. Oh, I've dozens of plans, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	50	122678	122654	122704	Queen	I shall give life here my best, and I believe it will give its best to me in return. When I left [MASK]'s my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought I could see along it for many a milestone.
AnneOfGreenGables	53	122745	122693	122746	Marilla	I thought I could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I don't know what lies around the bend, but I'm going to believe that the best does. It has a fascination of its own, that bend, [MASK].
AnneOfGreenGables	51	122913	122906	122957	Marilla	"You blessed girl!" said [MASK], yielding. "I feel as if you'd given me new life. I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to college--but I know I can't, so I ain't going to try.
AnneOfGreenGables	52	122967	122917	122969	Anne	"I feel as if you'd given me new life. I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to college--but I know I can't, so I ain't going to try. I'll make it up to you though, [MASK]."
AnneOfGreenGables	52	123186	123141	123193	Marilla	"I declare I'm getting glad to sit down. I've been on my feet all day, and two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round. It's a great blessing not to be fat, [MASK]. I hope you appreciate it.
AnneOfGreenGables	45	123196	123188	123233	Anne	I hope you appreciate it. Well, [MASK], I hear you've given up your notion of going to college. I was real glad to hear it. You've got as much education now as a woman can be comfortable with.
AnneOfGreenGables	51	123472	123463	123514	Gilbert	"So they did. But as soon as [MASK] heard that you had applied for it he went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night, you know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested that they accept yours.
AnneOfGreenGables	57	123641	123629	123686	Gilbert	"I mean--I don't think I ought to let [MASK] make such a sacrifice for--for me." "I guess you can't prevent him now. He's signed papers with the White Sands trustees. So it wouldn't do him any good now if you were to refuse.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	123707	123662	123709	Pyes	He's signed papers with the White Sands trustees. So it wouldn't do him any good now if you were to refuse. Of course you'll take the school. You'll get along all right, now that there are no [MASK] going.
AnneOfGreenGables	54	123710	123710	123764	Josie	[MASK] was the last of them, and a good thing she was, that's what. There's been some Pye or other going to Avonlea school for the last twenty years, and I guess their mission in life was to keep school teachers reminded that earth isn't their home.
AnneOfGreenGables	43	123820	123797	123840	Anne	"You know we keep up the old custom. Excuse me while I run over and see what she wants." [MASK] ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry shadows of the Haunted Wood.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	123882	123848	123892	Marilla	"There's a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways." "There's a good deal more of the woman about her in others," retorted [MASK], with a momentary return of her old crispness.
AnneOfGreenGables	47	124105	124099	124146	Anne	The beauty of it all thrilled [MASK]'s heart, and she gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it. "Dear old world," she murmured, "you are very lovely, and I am glad to be alive in you."
AnneOfGreenGables	43	124208	124207	124250	Gilbert	"[MASK]," she said, with scarlet cheeks, "I want to thank you for giving up the school for me. It was very good of you--and I want you to know that I appreciate it."
AnneOfGreenGables	44	124269	124258	124302	Anne	"It wasn't particularly good of me at all, [MASK]. I was pleased to be able to do you some small service. Are we going to be friends after this? Have you really forgiven me my old fault?"
AnneOfGreenGables	46	124303	124284	124330	Anne	Are we going to be friends after this? Have you really forgiven me my old fault?" [MASK] laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand. "I forgave you that day by the pond landing, although I didn't know it.
AnneOfGreenGables	44	124372	124331	124375	Gilbert	What a stubborn little goose I was. I've been--I may as well make a complete confession--I've been sorry ever since." "We are going to be the best of friends," said [MASK], jubilantly.
AnneOfGreenGables	55	124385	124376	124431	Anne	"We were born to be good friends, [MASK]. You've thwarted destiny enough. I know we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your studies, aren't you? So am I. Come, I'm going to walk home with you."
AnneOfGreenGables	53	124580	124529	124582	Marilla	But we have decided that it will be much more sensible to be good friends in the future. Were we really there half an hour? It seemed just a few minutes. But, you see, we have five years' lost conversations to catch up with, [MASK]."
