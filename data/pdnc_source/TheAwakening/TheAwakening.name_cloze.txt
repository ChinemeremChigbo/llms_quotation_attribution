TheAwakening	52	36	36	88	Sapristi	[MASK]!_ That's all right!" He could speak a little Spanish, and also a language which nobody understood, unless it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other side of the door, whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with maddening persistence.
TheAwakening	51	532	487	538	Beaudelet	Farther down, before one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down, telling her beads. A good many persons of the _pension_ had gone over to the _Ch ni re Caminada_ in [MASK]'s lugger to hear mass.
TheAwakening	48	874	831	879	Robert	She silently reached out to him, and he, understanding, took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them into her open palm. She slipped them upon her fingers; then clasping her knees, she looked across at [MASK] and began to laugh.
TheAwakening	49	901	887	936	Pontellier	He sent back an answering smile. "What is it?" asked [MASK], looking lazily and amused from one to the other. It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the water, and they both tried to relate it at once.
TheAwakening	41	1033	1020	1061	Edna	"Well, send him about his business when he bores you, [MASK]," instructed her husband as he prepared to leave. "Here, take the umbrella," she exclaimed, holding it out to him.
TheAwakening	50	1313	1267	1317	Robert	They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging. [MASK] rolled a cigarette.
TheAwakening	53	1527	1493	1546	Robert	Ch ni re;_ about the children playing croquet under the oaks, and the Farival twins, who were now performing the overture to "The Poet and the Peasant." [MASK] talked a good deal about himself. He was very young, and did not know any better.
TheAwakening	54	1792	1768	1822	Robert	She read a letter from her sister, who was away in the East, and who had engaged herself to be married. [MASK] was interested, and wanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were, what the father was like, and how long the mother had been dead.
TheAwakening	52	4739	4722	4774	Robert	She knew that I adored her once, and she let me adore her. It was [MASK], come; go; stand up; sit down; do this; do that; see if the baby sleeps; my thimble, please, that I left God knows where.
TheAwakening	50	4826	4793	4843	Ratignolle	I never had to ask. You were always there under my feet, like a troublesome cat." "You mean like an adoring dog. And just as soon as [MASK] appeared on the scene, then it _was_ like a dog. _Passez!
TheAwakening	51	4860	4841	4892	Alphonse	_Passez! Adieu! Allez vous-en!_'" "Perhaps I feared to make [MASK] jealous," she interjoined, with excessive na vet . That made them all laugh. The right hand jealous of the left! The heart jealous of the soul!
TheAwakening	55	6313	6300	6355	Edna	The excessive physical charm of the Creole had first attracted her, for [MASK] had a sensuous susceptibility to beauty. Then the candor of the woman's whole existence, which every one might read, and which formed so striking a contrast to her own habitual reserve this might have furnished a link.
TheAwakening	48	7462	7452	7500	Edna	"But for the fun of it," persisted [MASK]. "First of all, the sight of the water stretching so far away, those motionless sails against the blue sky, made a delicious picture that I just wanted to sit and look at.
TheAwakening	48	8046	8046	8094	Edna	[MASK] had had an occasional girl friend, but whether accidentally or not, they seemed to have been all of one type the self-contained. She never realized that the reserve of her own character had much, perhaps everything, to do with this.
TheAwakening	47	8231	8208	8255	Napoleon	She could not leave his presence when he was there, nor remove her eyes from his face, which was something like [MASK]'s, with a lock of black hair failing across the forehead. But the cavalry officer melted imperceptibly out of her existence.
TheAwakening	46	8315	8315	8361	Edna	[MASK] was a little miss, just merging into her teens; and the realization that she herself was nothing, nothing, nothing to the engaged young man was a bitter affliction to her. But he, too, went the way of dreams.
TheAwakening	56	8982	8938	8994	Robert	She was flushed and felt intoxicated with the sound of her own voice and the unaccustomed taste of candor. It muddled her like wine, or like a first breath of freedom. There was the sound of approaching voices. It was [MASK], surrounded by a troop of children, searching for them.
TheAwakening	50	9472	9442	9492	Robert	I hope she has discernment enough to find in me something besides the _blagueur_. If I thought there was any doubt " "Oh, enough, [MASK]!" she broke into his heated outburst. "You are not thinking of what you are saying.
TheAwakening	50	10113	10113	10163	Robert	[MASK] scanned the distance for any such apparition. They would doubtless remain away till the dinner hour. The young man ascended to his mother's room. It was situated at the top of the house, made up of odd angles and a queer, sloping ceiling.
TheAwakening	53	10248	10211	10264	Robert	A little black girl sat on the floor, and with her hands worked the treadle of the machine. The Creole woman does not take any chances which may be avoided of imperiling her health. [MASK] went over and seated himself on the broad sill of one of the dormer windows.
TheAwakening	48	10397	10355	10403	Victor	Don't forget to take it down when you go; it's there on the bookshelf over the small table." Clatter, clatter, clatter, bang! for the next five or eight minutes. "Where is [MASK] going with the rockaway?"
TheAwakening	53	10440	10411	10464	Robert	"Yes; down there in front. He seems to be getting ready to drive away somewhere." "Call him." Clatter, clatter! [MASK] uttered a shrill, piercing whistle which might have been heard back at the wharf. "He won't look up."
TheAwakening	54	10515	10515	10569	Victor	[MASK] was the younger son and brother a _t te mont e_, with a temper which invited violence and a will which no ax could break. "Whenever you say the word I'm ready to thrash any amount of reason into him that he's able to hold."
TheAwakening	50	12238	12205	12255	Edna	A general air of surprise and genuine satisfaction fell upon every one as they saw the pianist enter. There was a settling down, and a prevailing air of expectancy everywhere. [MASK] was a trifle embarrassed at being thus signaled out for the imperious little woman's favor.
TheAwakening	48	12640	12610	12658	Edna	She arose, and bowing her stiff, lofty bow, she went away, stopping for neither thanks nor applause. As she passed along the gallery she patted [MASK] upon the shoulder. "Well, how did you like my music?" she asked.
TheAwakening	42	12807	12780	12822	Robert	It shakes a man!" It was growing late, and there was a general disposition to disband. But some one, perhaps it was [MASK], thought of a bath at that mystic hour and under that mystic moon.
TheAwakening	42	13060	13033	13075	Klein	The people walked in little groups toward the beach. They talked and laughed; some of them sang. There was a band playing down at [MASK]'s hotel, and the strains reached them faintly, tempered by the distance.
TheAwakening	47	13210	13172	13219	Edna	The sea was quiet now, and swelled lazily in broad billows that melted into one another and did not break except upon the beach in little foamy crests that coiled back like slow, white serpents. [MASK] had attempted all summer to learn to swim.
TheAwakening	44	13238	13220	13264	Robert	She had received instructions from both the men and women; in some instances from the children. [MASK] had pursued a system of lessons almost daily; and he was nearly at the point of discouragement in realizing the futility of his efforts.
TheAwakening	46	14106	14076	14122	Robert	The people about me are like some uncanny, half-human beings. There must be spirits abroad to-night." "There are," whispered [MASK], "Didn't you know this was the twenty-eighth of August?"
TheAwakening	49	14412	14384	14433	Robert	She let her hand lie listlessly, as though her thoughts were elsewhere somewhere in advance of her body, and she was striving to overtake them. [MASK] assisted her into the hammock which swung from the post before her door out to the trunk of a tree.
TheAwakening	48	14872	14835	14883	Robert	No multitude of words could have been more significant than those moments of silence, or more pregnant with the first-felt throbbings of desire. When the voices of the bathers were heard approaching, [MASK] said good-night. She did not answer him.
TheAwakening	50	14918	14890	14940	Edna	Again she watched his figure pass in and out of the strips of moonlight as he walked away. XI "What are you doing out here, [MASK]? I thought I should find you in bed," said her husband, when he discovered her lying there.
TheAwakening	50	15198	15197	15247	Edna	"[MASK], dear, are you not coming in soon?" he asked again, this time fondly, with a note of entreaty. "No; I am going to stay out here." "This is more than folly," he blurted out.
TheAwakening	50	15716	15710	15760	L	"Are you coming in, [MASK] once?" she asked, turning her face toward her husband. "Yes, dear," he answered, with a glance following a misty puff of smoke. "Just as soon as I have finished my cigar."
TheAwakening	49	15761	15719	15768	XII	" she asked, turning her face toward her husband. "Yes, dear," he answered, with a glance following a misty puff of smoke. "Just as soon as I have finished my cigar." [MASK] She slept but a few hours.
TheAwakening	50	16392	16381	16431	Mariequita	No one present understood what they said. Her name was [MASK]. She had a round, sly, piquant face and pretty black eyes. Her hands were small, and she kept them folded over the handle of her basket. Her feet were broad and coarse.
TheAwakening	48	16440	16408	16456	Edna	Her hands were small, and she kept them folded over the handle of her basket. Her feet were broad and coarse. She did not strive to hide them. [MASK] looked at her feet, and noticed the sand and slime between her brown toes.
TheAwakening	52	16645	16630	16682	Robert	"Why does she look at me like that?" inquired the girl of [MASK]. "Maybe she thinks you are pretty. Shall I ask her?" "No. Is she your sweetheart?" "She's a married lady, and has two children."
TheAwakening	54	16754	16701	16755	Robert	They took all his money and one of the children and stole his boat." "Shut up!" "Does she understand?" "Oh, hush!" "Are those two married over there leaning on each other?" "Of course not," laughed [MASK].
TheAwakening	52	16873	16868	16920	Edna	ni re Caminada_, [MASK] felt as if she were being borne away from some anchorage which had held her fast, whose chains had been loosening had snapped the night before when the mystic spirit was abroad, leaving her free to drift whithersoever she chose to set her sails.
TheAwakening	44	17443	17406	17450	Robert	Another time she might have made an effort to regain her composure; but her one thought was to quit the stifling atmosphere of the church and reach the open air. She arose, climbing over [MASK]'s feet with a muttered apology.
TheAwakening	49	17522	17513	17562	Edna	"I felt giddy and almost overcome," [MASK] said, lifting her hands instinctively to her head and pushing her straw hat up from her forehead. "I couldn't have stayed through the service." They were outside in the shadow of the church.
TheAwakening	44	17563	17542	17586	Robert	"I couldn't have stayed through the service." They were outside in the shadow of the church. [MASK] was full of solicitude. "It was folly to have thought of going in the first place, let alone staying.
TheAwakening	52	17985	17971	18023	Edna	She was boiling mullets over a few red coals in the huge fireplace. [MASK], left alone in the little side room, loosened her clothes, removing the greater part of them. She bathed her face, her neck and arms in the basin that stood between the windows.
TheAwakening	48	18291	18265	18313	Edna	She understood French imperfectly unless directly addressed, and the voices were only part of the other drowsy, muffled sounds lulling her senses. When [MASK] awoke it was with the conviction that she had slept long and soundly. The voices were hushed under the shed.
TheAwakening	54	18363	18340	18394	Edna	The mosquito bar was drawn over her; the old woman had come in while she slept and let down the bar. [MASK] arose quietly from the bed, and looking between the curtains of the window, she saw by the slanting rays of the sun that the afternoon was far advanced.
TheAwakening	47	18423	18416	18463	Tonie	He was reading from a book. [MASK] was no longer with him. She wondered what had become of the rest of the party. She peeped out at him two or three times as she stood washing herself in the little basin between the windows.
TheAwakening	53	18492	18492	18545	Edna	[MASK] dabbed the powder upon her nose and cheeks as she looked at herself closely in the little distorted mirror which hung on the wall above the basin. Her eyes were bright and wide awake and her face glowed. When she had completed her toilet she walked into the adjoining room.
TheAwakening	54	18593	18556	18610	Edna	But there was a cloth spread upon the table that stood against the wall, and a cover was laid for one, with a crusty brown loaf and a bottle of wine beside the plate. [MASK] bit a piece from the brown loaf, tearing it with her strong, white teeth.
TheAwakening	50	18650	18611	18661	Robert	She poured some of the wine into the glass and drank it down. Then she went softly out of doors, and plucking an orange from the low-hanging bough of a tree, threw it at [MASK], who did not know she was awake and up.
TheAwakening	42	18821	18787	18829	Edna	The only evil I couldn't prevent was to keep a broiled fowl from drying up." "If it has turned to stone, still will I eat it," said [MASK], moving with him into the house.
TheAwakening	48	18887	18845	18893	L	"Gone hours ago. When they found that you were sleeping they thought it best not to awake you. Any way, I wouldn't have let them. What was I here for?" "I wonder if [MASK] once will be uneasy!"
TheAwakening	44	18917	18894	18938	Robert	she speculated, as she seated herself at table. "Of course not; he knows you are with me," [MASK] replied, as he busied himself among sundry pans and covered dishes which had been left standing on the hearth.
TheAwakening	49	18973	18966	19015	Tonie	I am to take you back in [MASK]'s boat whenever you are ready to go." He stirred the smoldering ashes till the broiled fowl began to sizzle afresh. He served her with no mean repast, dripping the coffee anew and sharing it with her.
TheAwakening	51	19158	19158	19209	Tonie	[MASK] did not dare to return. He was shy, and would not willingly face any woman except his mother. It was very pleasant to stay there under the orange trees, while the sun dipped lower and lower, turning the western sky to flaming copper and gold.
TheAwakening	52	19522	19503	19555	Edna	With the other chubby fist he rubbed his eyes, which were heavy with sleep and ill humor. [MASK] took him in her arms, and seating herself in the rocker, began to coddle and caress him, calling him all manner of tender names, soothing him to sleep.
TheAwakening	54	19806	19793	19847	Robert	"Do you know we have been together the whole livelong day, [MASK] since early this morning?" she said at parting. "All but the hundred years when you were sleeping. Good-night." He pressed her hand and went away in the direction of the beach.
TheAwakening	55	19864	19818	19873	Edna	"All but the hundred years when you were sleeping. Good-night." He pressed her hand and went away in the direction of the beach. He did not join any of the others, but walked alone toward the Gulf. [MASK] stayed outside, awaiting her husband's return.
TheAwakening	59	20005	19953	20012	Robert	She could only realize that she herself her present self was in some way different from the other self. That she was seeing with different eyes and making the acquaintance of new conditions in herself that colored and changed her environment, she did not yet suspect. She wondered why [MASK] had gone away and left her.
TheAwakening	51	20122	20096	20147	Robert	It began with "Ah! _si tu savais_," and every verse ended with "_si tu savais_." [MASK]'s voice was not pretentious. It was musical and true. The voice, the notes, the whole refrain haunted her memory.
TheAwakening	47	20150	20129	20176	Edna	It was musical and true. The voice, the notes, the whole refrain haunted her memory. XV When [MASK] entered the dining-room one evening a little late, as was her habit, an unusually animated conversation seemed to be going on.
TheAwakening	44	20393	20393	20437	Edna	[MASK]'s face was a blank picture of bewilderment, which she never thought of disguising. He lifted his eyebrows with the pretext of a smile as he returned her glance. He looked embarrassed and uneasy. "When is he going?
TheAwakening	52	20448	20410	20462	Robert	He lifted his eyebrows with the pretext of a smile as he returned her glance. He looked embarrassed and uneasy. "When is he going?" she asked of everybody in general, as if [MASK] were not there to answer for himself. "To-night!"
TheAwakening	46	20600	20597	20643	Robert	"Please let [MASK] explain why he is going, and why he is going to-night," she called out. "Really, this table is getting to be more and more like Bedlam every day, with everybody talking at once.
TheAwakening	45	20877	20871	20916	Robert	"This afternoon," returned [MASK], with a shade of annoyance. "At what time this afternoon?" persisted the old gentleman, with nagging determination, as if he were cross-questioning a criminal in a court of justice.
TheAwakening	51	21077	21052	21103	Robert	Father Fochel of the Cathedral had attempted to explain it; but he had not done so to her satisfaction. And she begged that [MASK] would interest himself, and discover, if possible, whether she was entitled to the indulgence accompanying the remarkably curious Mexican prayer-beads.
TheAwakening	50	21302	21292	21342	Beaudelet	"At ten," he told her. "[MASK] wants to wait for the moon." "Are you all ready to go?" "Quite ready. I shall only take a hand-bag, and shall pack my trunk in the city."
TheAwakening	57	21357	21311	21368	Edna	"Are you all ready to go?" "Quite ready. I shall only take a hand-bag, and shall pack my trunk in the city." He turned to answer some question put to him by his mother, and [MASK], having finished her black coffee, left the table.
TheAwakening	46	21619	21619	21665	Edna	[MASK] returned answer that she had already undressed, that she did not feel quite well, but perhaps she would go over to the house later. She started to dress again, and got as far advanced as to remove her _peignoir_.
TheAwakening	48	21838	21791	21839	Robert	"I think it was showing us all you especially very little consideration. It wouldn't have surprised me in any of the others; those Lebruns are all given to heroics. But I must say I should never have expected such a thing from [MASK].
TheAwakening	48	21863	21840	21888	Edna	Are you not coming down? Come on, dear; it doesn't look friendly." "No," said [MASK], a little sullenly. "I can't go to the trouble of dressing again; I don't feel like it."
TheAwakening	56	21918	21869	21925	Edna	"I can't go to the trouble of dressing again; I don't feel like it." "You needn't dress; you look all right; fasten a belt around your waist. Just look at me!" "No," persisted [MASK]; "but you go on.
TheAwakening	48	22067	22020	22068	Edna	"In twenty minutes," he said. The sudden and brief flare of the match emphasized the darkness for a while. He sat down upon a stool which the children had left out on the porch. "Get a chair," said [MASK].
TheAwakening	48	22111	22069	22117	Edna	"This will do," he replied. He put on his soft hat and nervously took it off again, and wiping his face with his handkerchief, complained of the heat. "Take the fan," said [MASK], offering it to him.
TheAwakening	49	22468	22431	22480	Robert	You won't I hope you won't completely forget me." She clung to his hand, striving to detain him. "Write to me when you get there, won't you, [MASK]?" she entreated. "I will, thank you.
TheAwakening	45	22488	22471	22516	Robert	she entreated. "I will, thank you. Good-by." How unlike [MASK]! The merest acquaintance would have said something more emphatic than "I will, thank you; good-by," to such a request.
TheAwakening	49	22887	22887	22936	Robert	[MASK]'s going had some way taken the brightness, the color, the meaning out of everything. The conditions of her life were in no way changed, but her whole existence was dulled, like a faded garment which seems to be no longer worth wearing.
TheAwakening	49	23104	23102	23151	Edna	It made [MASK] laugh, and she laughed, too, at the portrait in his first long trousers; while another interested her, taken when he left for college, looking thin, long-faced, with eyes full of fire, ambition and great intentions.
TheAwakening	44	23596	23596	23640	Edna	[MASK] tapped her foot impatiently, and wondered why the children persisted in playing in the sun when they might be under the trees. She went down and led them out of the sun, scolding the quadroon for not being more attentive.
TheAwakening	49	23657	23621	23670	Robert	She went down and led them out of the sun, scolding the quadroon for not being more attentive. It did not strike her as in the least grotesque that she should be making of [MASK] the object of conversation and leading her husband to speak of him.
TheAwakening	47	23677	23671	23718	Robert	The sentiment which she entertained for [MASK] in no way resembled that which she felt for her husband, or had ever felt, or ever expected to feel. She had all her life long been accustomed to harbor thoughts and emotions which never voiced themselves.
TheAwakening	48	24001	23995	24043	Robert	Why, of course I miss [MASK]. Are you going down to bathe?" "Why should I go down to bathe at the very end of the season when I haven't been in the surf all summer," replied the woman, disagreeably.
TheAwakening	42	24248	24229	24271	Mademoiselle	"Her favorite son, too. It must have been quite hard to let him go." [MASK] laughed maliciously. "Her favorite son! Oh, dear! Who could have been imposing such a tale upon you?
TheAwakening	49	24304	24283	24332	Robert	She has spoiled him into the worthless creature he is. She worships him and the ground he walks on. [MASK] is very well in a way, to give up all the money he can earn to the family, and keep the barest pittance for himself.
TheAwakening	50	24389	24348	24398	Victor	I liked to see him and to hear him about the place the only Lebrun who is worth a pinch of salt. He comes to see me often in the city. I like to play to him. That [MASK]! hanging would be too good for him.
TheAwakening	51	24637	24608	24659	Mademoiselle	For some reason she felt depressed, almost unhappy. She had not intended to go into the water; but she donned her bathing suit, and left [MASK] alone, seated under the shade of the children's tent. The water was growing cooler as the season advanced.
TheAwakening	52	25406	25364	25416	Edna	Whom did you have? Many callers?" he asked. He tasted his soup and began to season it with pepper, salt, vinegar, mustard everything within reach. "There were a good many," replied [MASK], who was eating her soup with evident satisfaction.
TheAwakening	52	25540	25499	25551	Joe	"Well, I hope you left some suitable excuse," said her husband, somewhat appeased, as he added a dash of cayenne pepper to the soup. "No, I left no excuse. I told [MASK] to say I was out, that was all."
TheAwakening	42	25670	25662	25704	Joe	"Bring the tray with the cards, [MASK]. I don't remember who was here." The boy retired and returned after a moment, bringing the tiny silver tray, which was covered with ladies' visiting cards.
TheAwakening	46	26056	26043	26089	Edna	"You used to think the cook was a treasure," returned [MASK], indifferently. "Perhaps she was when she first came; but cooks are only human. They need looking after, like any other class of persons that you employ.
TheAwakening	49	26643	26595	26644	Edna	She wanted to destroy something. The crash and clatter were what she wanted to hear. A maid, alarmed at the din of breaking glass, entered the room to discover what was the matter. "A vase fell upon the hearth," said [MASK].
TheAwakening	50	26809	26769	26819	Edna	Don't let us get anything new; you are too extravagant. I don't believe you ever think of saving or putting by." "The way to become rich is to make money, my dear [MASK], not to save it," he said.
TheAwakening	42	27509	27481	27523	Edna	His family lived in commodious apartments over the store, having an entrance on the side within the _porte coch re_. There was something which [MASK] thought very French, very foreign, about their whole manner of living.
TheAwakening	57	27686	27665	27722	Edna	"'Cit can do it as well as I; it is really her business," she explained to [MASK], who apologized for interrupting her. And she summoned a young black woman, whom she instructed, in French, to be very careful in checking off the list which she handed her.
TheAwakening	42	27771	27766	27808	Edna	Then placing an arm around [MASK]'s waist, she led her to the front of the house, to the salon, where it was cool and sweet with the odor of great roses that stood upon the hearth in jars.
TheAwakening	55	27857	27842	27897	Edna	"Perhaps I shall be able to paint your picture some day," said [MASK] with a smile when they were seated. She produced the roll of sketches and started to unfold them. "I believe I ought to work again. I feel as if I wanted to be doing something.
TheAwakening	52	27928	27878	27930	Laidpore	"I believe I ought to work again. I feel as if I wanted to be doing something. What do you think of them? Do you think it worth while to take it up again and study some more? I might study for a while with [MASK]."
TheAwakening	49	28081	28058	28107	Edna	never have I seen anything more lifelike. One might almost be tempted to reach out a hand and take one." [MASK] could not control a feeling which bordered upon complacency at her friend's praise, even realizing, as she did, its true worth.
TheAwakening	58	28221	28172	28230	Edna	His cheerfulness was unbounded, and it was matched by his goodness of heart, his broad charity, and common sense. He and his wife spoke English with an accent which was only discernible through its un-English emphasis and a certain carefulness and deliberation. [MASK]'s husband spoke English with no accent whatever.
TheAwakening	50	28262	28261	28311	Edna	As [MASK] seated herself at table with them she thought, "Better a dinner of herbs," though it did not take her long to discover that it was no dinner of herbs, but a delicious repast, simple, choice, and in every way satisfying.
TheAwakening	57	28407	28359	28416	Edna	He spoke with an animation and earnestness that gave an exaggerated importance to every syllable he uttered. His wife was keenly interested in everything he said, laying down her fork the better to listen, chiming in, taking the words out of his mouth. [MASK] felt depressed rather than soothed after leaving them.
TheAwakening	53	28787	28735	28788	Edna	"It seems to me the utmost folly for a woman at the head of a household, and the mother of children, to spend in an atelier days which would be better employed contriving for the comfort of her family." "I feel like painting," answered [MASK].
TheAwakening	44	29126	29112	29156	Edna	But the house-maid, too, served her term as model when [MASK] perceived that the young woman's back and shoulders were molded on classic lines, and that her hair, loosened from its confining cap, became an inspiration.
TheAwakening	44	29530	29507	29551	Edna	The directory which fell into her hands was a year or more old, however, and upon reaching the number indicated, [MASK] discovered that the house was occupied by a respectable family of mulattoes who had _chambres garnies_ to let.
TheAwakening	42	29900	29878	29920	Edna	At the side was a high fence enclosing the garden. A gate or door opening upon the street was locked. [MASK] rang the bell at this side garden gate, and stood upon the banquette, waiting to be admitted.
TheAwakening	52	29952	29931	29983	Edna	A black woman, wiping her hands upon her apron, was close at his heels. Before she saw them [MASK] could hear them in altercation, the woman plainly an anomaly claiming the right to be allowed to perform her duties, one of which was to answer the bell.
TheAwakening	52	30141	30119	30171	Edna	Whatever it was, the rebuke was convincing, for the woman dropped her hoe and went mumbling into the house. [MASK] did not wish to enter. It was very pleasant there on the side porch, where there were chairs, a wicker lounge, and a small table.
TheAwakening	45	30727	30727	30772	Victor	[MASK] said it was really not worth while to go inside for the letters, when his mother entreated him to go in search of them. He remembered the contents, which in truth he rattled off very glibly when put to the test.
TheAwakening	47	30894	30864	30911	Edna	He inclosed a check to his mother, and hoped she would affectionately remember him to all his friends. That was about the substance of the two letters. [MASK] felt that if there had been a message for her, she would have received it.
TheAwakening	49	30988	30981	31030	Victor	The afternoon was already well advanced. [MASK] escorted her out upon the banquette, lifted her parasol, and held it over her while he walked to the car with her. He entreated her to bear in mind that the disclosures of the afternoon were strictly confidential.
TheAwakening	58	31319	31310	31368	Edna	The little musician laughed all over when she saw [MASK]. Her laugh consisted of a contortion of the face and all the muscles of the body. She seemed strikingly homely, standing there in the afternoon light. She still wore the shabby lace and the artificial bunch of violets on the side of her head.
TheAwakening	53	31379	31338	31391	Mademoiselle	She seemed strikingly homely, standing there in the afternoon light. She still wore the shabby lace and the artificial bunch of violets on the side of her head. "So you remembered me at last," said [MASK]. "I had said to myself, Ah, bah!
TheAwakening	56	31425	31414	31470	Mademoiselle	"I had not thought much about it," answered [MASK]. The two had seated themselves on a little bumpy sofa which stood against the wall. "I am glad, however, that you came. I have the water boiling back there, and was just about to make some coffee.
TheAwakening	51	31500	31494	31545	Edna	always contented!" She took [MASK]'s hand between her strong wiry fingers, holding it loosely without warmth, and executing a sort of double theme upon the back and palm. "Yes," she went on; "I sometimes thought: She will never come.
TheAwakening	52	32083	32050	32102	Edna	Your question seems a little rude. Play the Impromptu." "But you have told me nothing of yourself. What are you doing?" "Painting!" laughed [MASK]. "I am becoming an artist. Think of it!" "Ah! an artist!
TheAwakening	50	32107	32085	32135	Madame	"I am becoming an artist. Think of it!" "Ah! an artist! You have pretensions, [MASK]." "Why pretensions? Do you think I could not become an artist?" "I do not know you well enough to say.
TheAwakening	54	32326	32326	32380	Mademoiselle	[MASK] played a soft interlude. It was an improvisation. She sat low at the instrument, and the lines of her body settled into ungraceful curves and angles that gave it an appearance of deformity. Gradually and imperceptibly the interlude melted into the soft opening minor chords of the Chopin Impromptu.
TheAwakening	54	32381	32337	32391	Edna	She sat low at the instrument, and the lines of her body settled into ungraceful curves and angles that gave it an appearance of deformity. Gradually and imperceptibly the interlude melted into the soft opening minor chords of the Chopin Impromptu. [MASK] did not know when the Impromptu began or ended.
TheAwakening	47	32537	32521	32568	Mademoiselle	She arose in some agitation to take her departure. "May I come again, [MASK]?" she asked at the threshold. "Come whenever you feel like it. Be careful; the stairs and landings are dark; don't stumble."
TheAwakening	56	32810	32807	32863	Pontellier	"Ah, [MASK]! Not sick, I hope. Come and have a seat. What news do you bring this morning?" He was quite portly, with a profusion of gray hair, and small blue eyes which age had robbed of much of their brightness but none of their penetration.
TheAwakening	49	32912	32864	32913	Edna	"Oh! I'm never sick, Doctor. You know that I come of tough fiber of that old Creole race of Pontelliers that dry up and finally blow away. I came to consult no, not precisely to consult to talk to you about [MASK].
TheAwakening	45	33081	33068	33113	Pontellier	"Well, well; women are not all alike, my dear [MASK]. We've got to consider " "I know that; I told you I couldn't explain. Her whole attitude toward me and everybody and everything has changed.
TheAwakening	53	33244	33235	33288	Pontellier	"What have you been doing to her, [MASK]?" "Doing! _Parbleu!_" "Has she," asked the Doctor, with a smile, "has she been associating of late with a circle of pseudo-intellectual women super-spiritual superior beings?
TheAwakening	41	34018	34012	34053	Edna	Would you advise me to take [MASK] along?" "By all means, if she wishes to go. If not, leave her here. Don't contradict her. The mood will pass, I assure you.
TheAwakening	52	34233	34199	34251	Janet	His coming was in the nature of a welcome disturbance; it seemed to furnish a new direction for her emotions. He had come to purchase a wedding gift for his daughter, [MASK], and an outfit for himself in which he might make a creditable appearance at her marriage.
TheAwakening	57	34317	34305	34362	Edna	But for the past few days the old gentleman had been upon [MASK]'s hands, and in his society she was becoming acquainted with a new set of sensations. He had been a colonel in the Confederate army, and still maintained, with the title, the military bearing which had always accompanied it.
TheAwakening	57	34710	34710	34767	Edna	[MASK] marveled, not comprehending. She herself was almost devoid of coquetry. There were one or two men whom she observed at the _soir e musicale;_ but she would never have felt moved to any kittenish display to attract their notice to any feline or feminine wiles to express herself toward them.
TheAwakening	51	34951	34919	34970	Edna	I think you would be more well, if you don't mind my saying it more united, if he did." "Oh! dear no!" said [MASK], with a blank look in her eyes. "What should I do if he stayed home?
TheAwakening	45	35328	35302	35347	Edna	But he failed to impose upon the Colonel, and was even far from impressing him with this trumped-up knowledge of bygone days. [MASK] had staked her father on his last venture, with the most gratifying results to both of them.
TheAwakening	50	35474	35436	35486	Edna	He endeavored, in a general way, to express a particular disapproval, and only succeeded in arousing the ire and opposition of his father-in-law. A pretty dispute followed, in which [MASK] warmly espoused her father's cause and the Doctor remained neutral.
TheAwakening	58	35954	35941	35999	Edna	The champagne was cold, and its subtle fumes played fantastic tricks with [MASK]'s memory that night. Outside, away from the glow of the fire and the soft lamplight, the night was chill and murky. The Doctor doubled his old-fashioned cloak across his breast as he strode home through the darkness.
TheAwakening	52	36030	35981	36033	Pontellier	The Doctor doubled his old-fashioned cloak across his breast as he strode home through the darkness. He knew his fellow-creatures better than most men; knew that inner life which so seldom unfolds itself to unanointed eyes. He was sorry he had accepted [MASK]'s invitation.
TheAwakening	44	36068	36034	36078	Arobin	He was growing old, and beginning to need rest and an imperturbed spirit. He did not want the secrets of other lives thrust upon him. "I hope it isn't [MASK]," he muttered to himself as he walked.
TheAwakening	50	36304	36293	36343	L	"You are too lenient, too lenient by far, [MASK] once," asserted the Colonel. "Authority, coercion are what is needed. Put your foot down good and hard; the only way to manage a wife. Take my word for it."
TheAwakening	59	36380	36380	36439	Edna	[MASK] was not so consciously gratified at her husband's leaving home as she had been over the departure of her father. As the day approached when he was to leave her for a comparatively long stay, she grew melting and affectionate, remembering his many acts of consideration and his repeated expressions of an ardent attachment.
TheAwakening	50	36674	36673	36723	Edna	When [MASK] was at last alone, she breathed a big, genuine sigh of relief. A feeling that was unfamiliar but very delicious came over her. She walked all through the house, from one room to another, as if inspecting it for the first time.
TheAwakening	54	36799	36792	36846	Edna	The garden walks were damp, and [MASK] called to the maid to bring out her rubber sandals. And there she stayed, and stooped, digging around the plants, trimming, picking dead, dry leaves. The children's little dog came out, interfering, getting in her way.
TheAwakening	49	36873	36847	36896	Edna	She scolded him, laughed at him, played with him. The garden smelled so good and looked so pretty in the afternoon sunlight. [MASK] plucked all the bright flowers she could find, and went into the house with them, she and the little dog.
TheAwakening	46	36989	36987	37033	Edna	That night [MASK] dined alone. The candelabra, with a few candles in the center of the table, gave all the light she needed. Outside the circle of light in which she sat, the large dining-room looked solemn and shadowy.
TheAwakening	52	37094	37054	37106	L	The wine tasted good; the _marron glac _ seemed to be just what she wanted. It was so pleasant, too, to dine in a comfortable _peignoir_. She thought a little sentimentally about [MASK] once and the children, and wondered what they were doing.
TheAwakening	45	37215	37174	37219	Edna	She realized that she had neglected her reading, and determined to start anew upon a course of improving studies, now that her time was completely her own to do with as she liked. After a refreshing bath, [MASK] went to bed.
TheAwakening	50	37251	37220	37270	Edna	And as she snuggled comfortably beneath the eiderdown a sense of restfulness invaded her, such as she had not known before. XXV When the weather was dark and cloudy [MASK] could not work. She needed the sun to mellow and temper her mood to the sticking point.
TheAwakening	45	37595	37562	37607	Edna	He possessed a good figure, a pleasing face, not overburdened with depth of thought or feeling; and his dress was that of the conventional man of fashion. He admired [MASK] extravagantly, after meeting her at the races with her father.
TheAwakening	41	37674	37657	37698	Edna	There were possibly a few track men out there who knew the race horse as well as [MASK], but there was certainly none who knew it better. She sat between her two companions as one having authority to speak.
TheAwakening	49	38147	38147	38196	Arobin	[MASK] asked permission to enter for a second to light his cigarette his match safe was empty. He filled his match safe, but did not light his cigarette until he left her, after she had expressed her willingness to go to the races with him again.
TheAwakening	57	38197	38165	38222	Edna	He filled his match safe, but did not light his cigarette until he left her, after she had expressed her willingness to go to the races with him again. [MASK] was neither tired nor sleepy. She was hungry again, for the Highcamp dinner, though of excellent quality, had lacked abundance.
TheAwakening	54	38252	38204	38258	Edna	She was hungry again, for the Highcamp dinner, though of excellent quality, had lacked abundance. She rummaged in the larder and brought forth a slice of Gruyere and some crackers. She opened a bottle of beer which she found in the icebox. [MASK] felt extremely restless and excited.
TheAwakening	55	38302	38259	38314	Arobin	She vacantly hummed a fantastic tune as she poked at the wood embers on the hearth and munched a cracker. She wanted something to happen something, anything; she did not know what. She regretted that she had not made [MASK] stay a half hour to talk over the horses with her.
TheAwakening	45	38702	38687	38732	Arobin	Her talk grew familiar and confidential. It was no labor to become intimate with [MASK]. His manner invited easy confidence. The preliminary stage of becoming acquainted was one which he always endeavored to ignore when a pretty and engaging woman was concerned.
TheAwakening	45	38738	38733	38778	Edna	He stayed and dined with [MASK]. He stayed and sat beside the wood fire. They laughed and talked; and before it was time to go he was telling her how different life might have been if he had known her years before.
TheAwakening	44	40031	40017	40061	Edna	It was misty, with heavy, lowering atmosphere, one afternoon, when [MASK] climbed the stairs to the pianist's apartments under the roof. Her clothes were dripping with moisture. She felt chilled and pinched as she entered the room.
TheAwakening	47	40062	40044	40091	Mademoiselle	Her clothes were dripping with moisture. She felt chilled and pinched as she entered the room. [MASK] was poking at a rusty stove that smoked a little and warmed the room indifferently. She was endeavoring to heat a pot of chocolate on the stove.
TheAwakening	43	40099	40079	40122	Edna	She was endeavoring to heat a pot of chocolate on the stove. The room looked cheerless and dingy to [MASK] as she entered. A bust of Beethoven, covered with a hood of dust, scowled at her from the mantelpiece.
TheAwakening	56	40133	40104	40160	Mademoiselle	A bust of Beethoven, covered with a hood of dust, scowled at her from the mantelpiece. "Ah! here comes the sunlight!" exclaimed [MASK], rising from her knees before the stove. "Now it will be warm and bright enough; I can let the fire alone."
TheAwakening	53	40176	40143	40196	Edna	"Now it will be warm and bright enough; I can let the fire alone." She closed the stove door with a bang, and approaching, assisted in removing [MASK]'s dripping mackintosh. "You are cold; you look miserable. The chocolate will soon be hot.
TheAwakening	49	40230	40197	40246	Mademoiselle	But would you rather have a taste of brandy? I have scarcely touched the bottle which you brought me for my cold." A piece of red flannel was wrapped around [MASK]'s throat; a stiff neck compelled her to hold her head on one side.
TheAwakening	53	40351	40331	40384	Edna	She was endeavoring to adjust the bunch of violets which had become loose from its fastening in her hair. [MASK] drew her down upon the sofa, and taking a pin from her own hair, secured the shabby artificial flowers in their accustomed place. "Aren't you astonished?"
TheAwakening	54	40417	40406	40460	Edna	where?" "Just two steps away," laughed [MASK], "in a little four-room house around the corner. It looks so cozy, so inviting and restful, whenever I pass by; and it's for rent. I'm tired looking after that big house.
TheAwakening	50	40532	40506	40556	Edna	There is no use in telling me lies. I don't know your reason, but you have not told me the truth." [MASK] did not protest or endeavor to justify herself. "The house, the money that provides for it, are not mine.
TheAwakening	50	40573	40557	40607	Mademoiselle	Isn't that enough reason?" "They are your husband's," returned [MASK], with a shrug and a malicious elevation of the eyebrows. "Oh! I see there is no deceiving you. Then let me tell you: It is a caprice.
TheAwakening	58	40650	40630	40688	Laidpore	I won a large sum this winter on the races, and I am beginning to sell my sketches. [MASK] is more and more pleased with my work; he says it grows in force and individuality. I cannot judge of that myself, but I feel that I have gained in ease and confidence.
TheAwakening	46	40797	40757	40803	Mademoiselle	"What does your husband say?" "I have not told him yet. I only thought of it this morning. He will think I am demented, no doubt. Perhaps you think so." [MASK] shook her head slowly. "
TheAwakening	50	40823	40817	40867	Edna	Neither was it quite clear to [MASK] herself; but it unfolded itself as she sat for a while in silence. Instinct had prompted her to put away her husband's bounty in casting off her allegiance. She did not know how it would be when he returned.
TheAwakening	54	40920	40868	40922	Edna	There would have to be an understanding, an explanation. Conditions would some way adjust themselves, she felt; but whatever came, she had resolved never again to belong to another than herself. "I shall give a grand dinner before I leave the old house!" [MASK] exclaimed.
TheAwakening	51	40932	40923	40974	Mademoiselle	"You will have to come to it, [MASK]. I will give you everything that you like to eat and to drink. We shall sing and laugh and be merry for once." And she uttered a sigh that came from the very depths of her being.
TheAwakening	50	41094	41077	41127	Mademoiselle	so soon!" she exclaimed, her eyes filled with delight. "Tell me, [MASK], does he know that I see his letters?" "Never in the world! He would be angry and would never write to me again if he thought so.
TheAwakening	45	41218	41182	41227	Mademoiselle	"Why do you show me his letters, then?" "Haven't you begged for them? Can I refuse you anything? Oh! you cannot deceive me," and [MASK] approached her beloved instrument and began to play.
TheAwakening	49	41228	41228	41277	Edna	[MASK] did not at once read the letter. She sat holding it in her hand, while the music penetrated her whole being like an effulgence, warming and brightening the dark places of her soul. It prepared her for joy and exultation. "Oh!"
TheAwakening	50	41302	41266	41316	Mademoiselle	It prepared her for joy and exultation. "Oh!" she exclaimed, letting the letter fall to the floor. "Why did you not tell me?" She went and grasped [MASK]'s hands up from the keys. "Oh! unkind! malicious!
TheAwakening	52	41359	41311	41363	Edna	Oh! unkind! malicious! Why did you not tell me?" "That he was coming back? No great news, _ma foi_. I wonder he did not come long ago." "But when, when?" cried [MASK], impatiently. "
TheAwakening	57	41566	41525	41582	Mademoiselle	It seems to me if I were young and in love I should never deem a man of ordinary caliber worthy of my devotion." "Now it is you who are telling lies and seeking to deceive me, [MASK]; or else you have never been in love, and know nothing about it.
TheAwakening	53	41697	41646	41699	Robert	Or, I shall set my heart upon this musician, whose fame is on every tongue?' Or, This financier, who controls the world's money markets?'" "You are purposely misunderstanding me, _ma reine_. Are you in love with [MASK]?"
TheAwakening	50	41705	41700	41750	Edna	"Yes," said [MASK]. It was the first time she had admitted it, and a glow overspread her face, blotching it with red spots. "Why?" asked her companion. "Why do you love him when you ought not to?"
TheAwakening	51	42072	42071	42122	Edna	" [MASK] was tired by that time, and was reclining on the lounge before the fire. "Don't you know the weather prophet has told us we shall see the sun pretty soon?" "Well, that ought to be reason enough," he acquiesced.
TheAwakening	50	42594	42565	42615	Edna	Why have you introduced her at a moment when I desired to talk of you?" "Oh! talk of me if you like," cried [MASK], clasping her hands beneath her head; "but let me think of something else while you do."
TheAwakening	49	42822	42796	42845	Robert	There was her husband's reproach looking at her from the external things around her which he had provided for her external existence. There was [MASK]'s reproach making itself felt by a quicker, fiercer, more overpowering love, which had awakened within her toward him.
TheAwakening	41	43458	43438	43479	Edna	So it was he who in turn mounted the ladder, unhooking pictures and curtains, and dislodging ornaments as [MASK] directed. When he had finished he took off his dust-cap and went out to wash his hands.
TheAwakening	48	43480	43480	43528	Edna	[MASK] was sitting on the tabouret, idly brushing the tips of a feather duster along the carpet when he came in again. "Is there anything more you will let me do?" he asked. "That is all," she answered. "
TheAwakening	53	43554	43536	43589	Arobin	She kept the young woman occupied in the drawing-room, unwilling to be left alone with [MASK]. "What about the dinner?" he asked; "the grand event, the _coup d' tat?_" "It will be day after to-morrow.
TheAwakening	51	43639	43606	43657	L	it will be very fine; all my best of everything crystal, silver and gold, S vres, flowers, music, and champagne to swim in. I'll let [MASK] once pay the bills. I wonder what he'll say when he sees the bills."
TheAwakening	50	43676	43645	43695	Arobin	I wonder what he'll say when he sees the bills." "And you ask me why I call it a _coup d' tat?_" [MASK] had put on his coat, and he stood before her and asked if his cravat was plumb.
TheAwakening	51	43728	43696	43747	Ellen	She told him it was, looking no higher than the tip of his collar. "When do you go to the pigeon house?' with all due acknowledgment to [MASK]." "Day after to-morrow, after the dinner. I shall sleep there."
TheAwakening	51	43848	43818	43869	Arobin	I must get rid of this grime, and I have a million things to do and think of." "When shall I see you?" asked [MASK], seeking to detain her, the maid having left the room. "At the dinner, of course.
TheAwakening	48	44659	44650	44698	Arobin	"Then, all things considered," spoke [MASK], "it might not be amiss to start out by drinking the Colonel's health in the cocktail which he composed, on the birthday of the most charming of women the daughter whom he invented."
TheAwakening	41	44896	44883	44924	Arobin	"There are so many inquisitive people and institutions abounding," said [MASK], "that one is really forced as a matter of convenience these days to assume the virtue of an occupation if he has it not."
TheAwakening	49	45279	45243	45292	Edna	Outside the soft, monotonous splash of a fountain could be heard; the sound penetrated into the room with the heavy odor of jessamine that came through the open windows. The golden shimmer of [MASK]'s satin gown spread in rich folds on either side of her.
TheAwakening	55	45604	45568	45623	Edna	She had eaten well; she had tasted the good, rich wines, and they must have turned her head, for she bowed pleasantly to all as she withdrew from table. She kissed [MASK] upon the shoulder, and whispered: "_Bonne nuit, ma reine; soyez sage_.
TheAwakening	48	46116	46082	46130	Edna	He clasped his hands behind his head, and looking up at the ceiling began to hum a little, trying his voice like a musician tuning an instrument. Then, looking at [MASK], he began to sing: "Ah! si tu savais!"
TheAwakening	45	46195	46195	46240	Victor	[MASK] had lost all idea of courtesy, or else he thought his hostess was not in earnest, for he laughed and went on: "Ah! si tu savais Ce que tes yeux me disent" "Oh! you mustn't!
TheAwakening	46	46247	46222	46268	Edna	Ah! si tu savais Ce que tes yeux me disent" "Oh! you mustn't! you mustn't," exclaimed [MASK], and pushing back her chair she got up, and going behind him placed her hand over his mouth.
TheAwakening	57	46342	46292	46349	Victor	I didn't know you meant it," looking up at her with caressing eyes. The touch of his lips was like a pleasing sting to her hand. She lifted the garland of roses from his head and flung it across the room. "Come, [MASK]; you've posed long enough.
TheAwakening	51	46606	46565	46616	Celestine	"The servants are all gone. They left when the musicians did. I have dismissed them. The house has to be closed and locked, and I shall trot around to the pigeon house, and shall send [MASK] over in the morning to straighten things up."
TheAwakening	47	46698	46671	46718	Edna	And bring me my wrap and hat on the foot of the bed in the middle room." He went up with the light, and [MASK] began closing doors and windows. She hated to shut in the smoke and the fumes of the wine.
TheAwakening	44	47080	47062	47106	Edna	Her bedroom was adjoining, and across a small passage were the dining-room and kitchen. [MASK] seated herself with every appearance of discomfort. "Are you tired?" he asked. "Yes, and chilled, and miserable.
TheAwakening	53	47578	47566	47619	Edna	It might do incalculable mischief to his business prospects. But remembering [MASK]'s whimsical turn of mind of late, and foreseeing that she had immediately acted upon her impetuous determination, he grasped the situation with his usual promptness and handled it with his well-known business tact and cleverness.
TheAwakening	47	47626	47620	47667	Edna	The same mail which brought to [MASK] his letter of disapproval carried instructions the most minute instructions to a well-known architect concerning the remodeling of his home, changes which he had long contemplated, and which he desired carried forward during his temporary absence.
TheAwakening	49	48303	48269	48318	Raoul	But, above all, they were fired with a desire to see the little house around the block. Was there any place to play? Were there any boys next door? [MASK], with pessimistic foreboding, was convinced that there were only girls next door.
TheAwakening	48	48399	48390	48438	Edna	It was with a wrench and a pang that [MASK] left her children. She carried away with her the sound of their voices and the touch of their cheeks. All along the journey homeward their presence lingered with her like the memory of a delicious song.
TheAwakening	49	48974	48964	49013	Edna	"Does he boast of his successes?" asked [MASK], indifferently, squinting at her picture. "No, I think not. I believe he is a decent fellow as far as that goes. But his character is so well known among the men.
TheAwakening	55	49044	48990	49045	Edna	I believe he is a decent fellow as far as that goes. But his character is so well known among the men. I shan't be able to come back and see you; it was very, very imprudent to-day." "Mind the step!" cried [MASK].
TheAwakening	58	49261	49261	49319	Edna	[MASK] sat at the window, which looked out over the house-tops and across the river. The window frame was filled with pots of flowers, and she sat and picked the dry leaves from a rose geranium. The day was warm, and the breeze which blew from the river was very pleasant.
TheAwakening	57	49387	49356	49413	Edna	But it was a young black girl, who came in, bringing a small bundle of laundry, which she deposited in the adjoining room, and went away. [MASK] seated herself at the piano, and softly picked out with one hand the bars of a piece of music which lay open before her.
TheAwakening	52	49469	49421	49473	Mademoiselle	There was the occasional sound of people going and coming in the lower hall. She was growing interested in her occupation of picking out the aria, when there was a second rap at the door. She vaguely wondered what these people did when they found [MASK]'s door locked.
TheAwakening	56	49537	49500	49556	Robert	She attempted to rise; she could not have done so without betraying the agitation which mastered her at sight of him, so she fell back upon the stool, only exclaiming, "Why, [MASK]!" He came and clasped her hand, seemingly without knowing what he was saying or doing.
TheAwakening	51	49595	49578	49629	Edna	I never expected to see you." "When did you come back?" asked [MASK] in an unsteady voice, wiping her face with her handkerchief. She seemed ill at ease on the piano stool, and he begged her to take the chair by the window.
TheAwakening	59	49770	49756	49815	Mademoiselle	"Day before yesterday," she repeated, breaking off a spray of [MASK]'s geranium; "then if you had not met me here to-day you wouldn't when that is, didn't you mean to come and see me?" "Of course, I should have gone to see you.
TheAwakening	53	49828	49816	49869	Mademoiselle	There have been so many things " he turned the leaves of [MASK]'s music nervously. "I started in at once yesterday with the old firm. After all there is as much chance for me here as there was there that is, I might find it profitable some day.
TheAwakening	45	50305	50268	50313	Edna	A flush overspread his whole face. "I couldn't believe that my letters would be of any interest to you." "That is an excuse; it isn't the truth." [MASK] reached for her hat on the piano.
TheAwakening	52	50394	50384	50436	Edna	"Won't you wait for her?" asked [MASK]. "Not if you think she will not be back till late," adding, as if suddenly aware of some discourtesy in his speech, "and I should miss the pleasure of walking home with you."
TheAwakening	55	50437	50396	50451	Edna	"Not if you think she will not be back till late," adding, as if suddenly aware of some discourtesy in his speech, "and I should miss the pleasure of walking home with you." [MASK] locked the door and put the key back in its hiding-place.
TheAwakening	48	50583	50536	50584	Robert	"Why?" She did not answer. They went on around the corner, and it seemed as if her dreams were coming true after all, when he followed her into the little house. "You must stay and dine with me, [MASK].
TheAwakening	51	50744	50694	50745	Robert	"Oh! you know I want to stay if you will let me!" he exclaimed. All the softness came back. She laughed, and went and put her hand on his shoulder. "This is the first moment you have seemed like the old [MASK].
TheAwakening	51	50758	50752	50803	Celestine	" She hurried away to tell [MASK] to set an extra place. She even sent her off in search of some added delicacy which she had not thought of for herself. And she recommended great care in dripping the coffee and having the omelet done to a proper turn.
TheAwakening	41	50808	50785	50826	Robert	And she recommended great care in dripping the coffee and having the omelet done to a proper turn. When she reentered, [MASK] was turning over magazines, sketches, and things that lay upon the table in great disorder.
TheAwakening	51	50866	50841	50892	Edna	What on earth is his picture doing here?" "I tried to make a sketch of his head one day," answered [MASK], "and he thought the photograph might help me. It was at the other house. I thought it had been left there.
TheAwakening	52	50950	50905	50957	Robert	"I should think you would give it back to him if you have finished with it." "Oh! I have a great many such photographs. I never think of returning them. They don't amount to anything." [MASK] kept on looking at the picture.
TheAwakening	59	51256	51247	51306	Edna	XXXIV The dining-room was very small. [MASK]'s round mahogany would have almost filled it. As it was there was but a step or two from the little table to the kitchen, to the mantel, the small buffet, and the side door that opened out on the narrow brick-paved yard.
TheAwakening	43	51439	51418	51461	Celestine	He went out to a neighboring cigar stand to purchase cigarette papers, and when he came back he found that [MASK] had served the black coffee in the parlor. "Perhaps I shouldn't have come back," he said.
TheAwakening	49	51570	51531	51580	Edna	His tobacco pouch, which he laid upon the table, was a fantastic embroidered silk affair, evidently the handiwork of a woman. "You used to carry your tobacco in a rubber pouch," said [MASK], picking up the pouch and examining the needlework.
TheAwakening	52	51959	51940	51992	Edna	"Did they embroider slippers and tobacco pouches and hat-bands and things for you?" asked [MASK]. "Oh! my! no! I didn't get so deep in their regard. I fear they made more impression on me than I made on them."
TheAwakening	42	51999	51961	52003	Robert	"Oh! my! no! I didn't get so deep in their regard. I fear they made more impression on me than I made on them." "You were less fortunate than [MASK], then."
TheAwakening	50	52208	52170	52220	Arobin	I think I shall write now, and say that I am sorry her child is sick, and tell her not to count on me." "It would be a good scheme," acquiesced [MASK]. "I don't blame you; stupid lot!"
TheAwakening	47	52239	52239	52286	Arobin	[MASK] lit a cigar and read the evening paper, which he had in his pocket. "What is the date?" she asked. He told her. "Will you mail this for me when you go out?" "Certainly."
TheAwakening	50	53007	52998	53048	Arobin	Much to her surprise she received a note from [MASK], written at midnight from the club. It was to say good morning to her, to hope she had slept well, to assure her of his devotion, which he trusted she in some faintest manner returned.
TheAwakening	56	53381	53330	53386	Arobin	His horses were full of mettle, and even a little unmanageable. She liked the rapid gait at which they spun along, and the quick, sharp sound of the horses' hoofs on the hard road. They did not stop anywhere to eat or to drink. [MASK] was not needlessly imprudent.
TheAwakening	54	53429	53410	53464	Arobin	It was late when he left her. It was getting to be more than a passing whim with [MASK] to see her and be with her. He had detected the latent sensuality, which unfolded under his delicate sense of her nature's requirements like a torpid, torrid, sensitive blossom.
TheAwakening	48	53893	53860	53908	Catiche	"Do you come here often?" he asked. "I almost live here," she said. "I used to drop in very often for a cup of [MASK]'s good coffee. This is the first time since I came back."
TheAwakening	45	53934	53924	53969	Edna	There's always enough for two even three." [MASK] had intended to be indifferent and as reserved as he when she met him; she had reached the determination by a laborious train of reasoning, incident to one of her despondent moods.
TheAwakening	52	54249	54242	54294	Robert	"I'm spoiling your dinner, [MASK]; never mind what I say. You haven't eaten a morsel." "I only came in for a cup of coffee." His sensitive face was all disfigured with excitement. "Isn't this a delightful place?"
TheAwakening	54	54396	54348	54402	Catiche	However, I don't mind walking. I always feel so sorry for women who don't like to walk; they miss so much so many rare little glimpses of life; and we women learn so little of life on the whole." "[MASK]'s coffee is always hot.
TheAwakening	57	54418	54403	54460	Celestine	I don't know how she manages it, here in the open air. [MASK]'s coffee gets cold bringing it from the kitchen to the dining-room. Three lumps! How can you drink it so sweet? Take some of the cress with your chop; it's so biting and crisp.
TheAwakening	55	54583	54580	54635	Edna	He looked at [MASK]'s book, which he had read; and he told her the end, to save her the trouble of wading through it, he said. Again he accompanied her back to her home; and it was after dusk when they reached the little "pigeon-house.
TheAwakening	48	54773	54748	54796	Robert	Then she went across the room to where he sat. She bent over the arm of his chair and called his name. "[MASK]," she said, "are you asleep?" "No," he answered, looking up at her.
TheAwakening	49	54962	54949	54998	Pontellier	"Why? Because you were not free; you were L once [MASK]'s wife. I couldn't help loving you if you were ten times his wife; but so long as I went away from you and kept away I could help telling you so.
TheAwakening	49	55330	55315	55364	Robert	I give myself where I choose. If he were to say, Here, [MASK], take her and be happy; she is yours,' I should laugh at you both." His face grew a little white. "What do you mean?"
TheAwakening	54	55453	55443	55497	Robert	"Let me walk over with you," offered [MASK]. "No," she said; "I will go with the servant." She went into her room to put on her hat, and when she came in again she sat once more upon the sofa beside him.
TheAwakening	49	55518	55470	55519	Robert	" She went into her room to put on her hat, and when she came in again she sat once more upon the sofa beside him. He had not stirred. She put her arms about his neck. "Good-by, my sweet [MASK].
TheAwakening	50	55617	55568	55618	Robert	It was you who awoke me last summer out of a life-long, stupid dream. Oh! you have made me so unhappy with your indifference. Oh! I have suffered, suffered! Now you are here we shall love each other, my [MASK].
TheAwakening	48	55662	55627	55675	Robert	Nothing else in the world is of any consequence. I must go to my friend; but you will wait for me? No matter how late; you will wait for me, [MASK]?" "Don't go; don't go! Oh!
TheAwakening	53	55676	55665	55718	Edna	"Don't go; don't go! Oh! [MASK], stay with me," he pleaded. "Why should you go? Stay with me, stay with me." "I shall come back as soon as I can; I shall find you here."
TheAwakening	56	55768	55719	55775	Edna	She buried her face in his neck, and said good-by again. Her seductive voice, together with his great love for her, had enthralled his senses, had deprived him of every impulse but the longing to hold her and keep her. XXXVII [MASK] looked in at the drug store.
TheAwakening	58	56058	56001	56059	Edna	It lay in a long braid on the sofa pillow, coiled like a golden serpent. The nurse, a comfortable looking Griffe woman in white apron and cap, was urging her to return to her bedroom. "There is no use, there is no use," she said at once to [MASK].
TheAwakening	55	56216	56166	56221	Mandelet	After a moment or two she uttered a profound sigh and wiped her face with the handkerchief rolled in a ball. She appeared exhausted. The nurse gave her a fresh handkerchief, sprinkled with cologne water. "This is too much!" she cried. "[MASK] ought to be killed!
TheAwakening	41	56377	56351	56392	Edna	He was accustomed to them at such times, and was too well convinced of her loyalty to doubt it. He was glad to see [MASK], and wanted her to go with him into the salon and entertain him.
TheAwakening	47	56427	56408	56455	Edna	Between agonizing moments, she chatted a little, and said it took her mind off her sufferings. [MASK] began to feel uneasy. She was seized with a vague dread. Her own like experiences seemed far away, unreal, and only half remembered.
TheAwakening	41	56628	56617	56658	Edna	Oh think of the children! Remember them!" XXXVIII [MASK] still felt dazed when she got outside in the open air. The Doctor's coup had returned for him and stood before the _porte coch re_.
TheAwakening	48	56904	56861	56909	L	"Oh, well!" she answered, indifferently. "I don't know that it matters after all. One has to think of the children some time or other; the sooner the better." "When is [MASK] once coming back?"
TheAwakening	52	57327	57318	57370	Doctor	I don't know what I'm saying, [MASK]. Good night. Don't blame me for anything." "Yes, I will blame you if you don't come and see me soon. We will talk of things you never have dreamt of talking about before.
TheAwakening	50	57644	57644	57694	Robert	[MASK] was not waiting for her in the little parlor. He was nowhere at hand. The house was empty. But he had scrawled on a piece of paper that lay in the lamplight: "I love you. Good-by because I love you."
TheAwakening	50	57695	57661	57711	Edna	The house was empty. But he had scrawled on a piece of paper that lay in the lamplight: "I love you. Good-by because I love you." [MASK] grew faint when she read the words. She went and sat on the sofa.
TheAwakening	52	57752	57712	57764	Celestine	Then she stretched herself out there, never uttering a sound. She did not sleep. She did not go to bed. The lamp sputtered and went out. She was still awake in the morning, when [MASK] unlocked the kitchen door and came in to light the fire.
TheAwakening	45	57787	57787	57832	Mariequita	[MASK] sat near by, dangling her legs, watching him work, and handing him nails from the tool-box. The sun was beating down upon them. The girl had covered her head with her apron folded into a square pad.
TheAwakening	53	58277	58246	58299	Philomel	I'll give you my room; it's the only place." "Any corner will do," she assured him. "And if you can stand [MASK]'s cooking," he went on, "though I might try to get her mother while you are here.
TheAwakening	48	58416	58406	58454	Edna	"What time will you have dinner?" asked [MASK]. "I'm very hungry; but don't get anything extra." "I'll have it ready in little or no time," he said, bustling and packing away his tools.
TheAwakening	56	58469	58418	58474	Mariequita	"I'm very hungry; but don't get anything extra." "I'll have it ready in little or no time," he said, bustling and packing away his tools. "You may go to my room to brush up and rest yourself. [MASK] will show you."
TheAwakening	51	58481	58475	58526	Edna	"Thank you," said [MASK]. "But, do you know, I have a notion to go down to the beach and take a good wash and even a little swim, before dinner?" "The water is too cold!" they both exclaimed.
TheAwakening	50	58706	58676	58726	Edna	"I'll go to the kitchen and see what I can do. By Gimminy! Women have no consideration! She might have sent me word." [MASK] walked on down to the beach rather mechanically, not noticing anything special except that the sun was hot.
TheAwakening	54	58884	58861	58915	Robert	There was no one thing in the world that she desired. There was no human being whom she wanted near her except [MASK]; and she even realized that the day would come when he, too, and the thought of him would melt out of her existence, leaving her alone.
TheAwakening	45	59413	59400	59445	Exhaustion	The artist must possess the courageous soul that dares and defies." [MASK] was pressing upon and overpowering her. "Good-by because I love you." He did not know; he did not understand. He would never understand.
