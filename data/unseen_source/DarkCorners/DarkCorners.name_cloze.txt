DarkCorners	55	201	147	202	Emily	She focused on the cause that had brought her here: lobbying for government transparency and fighting to hold those in power accountable for their actions. As a community organizer for Citizens for Social Justice, she knew firsthand the importance of grassroots activism and giving a voice to the disenfranchised. "[MASK]!
DarkCorners	45	210	203	248	Ben	Are you ready?" called out [MASK], a fellow organizer and friend. He stepped up next to her, his warm hand on her shoulder, and smiled encouragingly. "It's time to show them what we're made of.
DarkCorners	52	250	249	301	Emily	" [MASK] opened her eyes and glanced at him, nodding. "Let's do this," she said, her voice steady despite the nerves fluttering in her stomach. The stage loomed before her, sturdy wooden planks creaking underfoot as she made her way up the steps.
DarkCorners	56	331	302	358	Emily	The noise from the gathering crowd slowly grew into a cacophony of cheers and applause, the sound washing over her like a wave. Her heart racing, [MASK] briefly scanned the faces in the sea of people, all of them eager to listen to her words and support the cause she held dear.
DarkCorners	49	425	389	438	Emily	"Today, we stand united in our fight for government transparency! We demand accountability from those who claim to represent us, and we will not be silenced!" As she spoke, [MASK] felt the weight of her responsibility and the importance of her message.
DarkCorners	50	512	464	514	Emily	The countless conversations with people who had shared their stories and struggles fueled her desire to make a difference in their lives. "Too often, our government operates in the shadows, making decisions that impact all of us without our knowledge or consent," [MASK] continued.
DarkCorners	53	567	547	600	Emily	As she looked out upon the sea of faces – young and old, from all walks of life – [MASK] felt a surge of pride and determination. This was her purpose: to be a catalyst for change and to empower others to join her in the fight for social justice.
DarkCorners	45	611	576	621	Emily	This was her purpose: to be a catalyst for change and to empower others to join her in the fight for social justice. "But we cannot do this alone," [MASK] said, her voice ringing out over the crowd.
DarkCorners	56	724	712	768	Emily	"We must remember that change does not come easy," [MASK] said, her tone serious. "It takes perseverance, dedication, and most importantly, unity. We must stand together to fight for what we believe in, for the betterment of our society and the world we live in.
DarkCorners	55	785	731	786	Emily	"It takes perseverance, dedication, and most importantly, unity. We must stand together to fight for what we believe in, for the betterment of our society and the world we live in." The crowd erupted in a thunderous applause, their cheers filling the air and energizing [MASK].
DarkCorners	47	845	811	858	Emily	But with the support of her fellow activists and the community at large, she was ready to lead the charge toward a more just and equitable world. With a determined smile, [MASK] stepped down from the stage and began to walk through the crowd.
DarkCorners	46	889	859	905	Emily	The energy was palpable, and she could feel the shared passion for change emanating from the diverse group of people gathered before her. "Excuse me," [MASK] said gently as she approached a teenage girl standing near the front of the crowd.
DarkCorners	43	933	928	971	Emily	Handing her the microphone, [MASK] asked, "Why are you here today? What brings you to this rally?" The girl hesitated briefly before replying, "I'm here because I want to be part of the change.
DarkCorners	48	1004	972	1020	Emily	I don't want to just sit back and watch as our government keeps secrets from us. I want to have a say in what happens to my future." [MASK] smiled warmly at the girl, feeling a sense of pride swelling within her chest.
DarkCorners	51	1087	1049	1100	Emily	Your presence here today shows that you are committed to making a difference, and together, we can fight for the transparency and accountability we deserve." As the crowd erupted in cheers once more, [MASK] returned to the stage, feeling the support of every person present.
DarkCorners	56	1132	1101	1157	Emily	"Let us not forget that it is through the collective efforts of every individual, no matter their age or background, that we can create meaningful change," [MASK] declared. "Together, we have the power to challenge the status quo and demand a better world for ourselves and future generations.
DarkCorners	51	1160	1135	1186	Emily	"Together, we have the power to challenge the status quo and demand a better world for ourselves and future generations." As [MASK] spoke, she sensed that they were on the cusp of something monumental—a turning point in their fight for government transparency and accountability.
DarkCorners	48	1261	1220	1268	Emily	Just then, she became aware of an odd, slightly uncomfortable sensation in her arm. Had a bee stung her? "However, we must not let ourselves be deterred by the obstacles in our path," [MASK] continued, her voice wavering slightly.
DarkCorners	54	1368	1343	1397	Emily	The crowd was hanging on her every word, their expressions resolute and determined. She couldn't falter now. "Remember," [MASK] cautioned, her voice growing weaker, "it's not enough to simply demand transparency; we must also hold our elected leaders accountable for their actions.
DarkCorners	51	1442	1419	1470	Emily	" The dizziness she felt intensified, and her legs began to feel weak beneath her. Despite her determination to continue, [MASK] became disoriented, struggling to maintain her balance as the world swirled around her. She pressed on, trying to hold onto her train of thought.
DarkCorners	51	1519	1505	1556	Emily	Suddenly, unable to bear the weight of her own body any longer, [MASK]'s legs gave out, and she crumpled to the stage floor. The microphone slipped from her grasp and clattered against the wooden platform, sending a wave of confusion rippling through the shocked crowd.
DarkCorners	41	1561	1561	1602	Ben	[MASK] cried out, rushing to her side. Concerned murmurs erupted among the audience. "Is she okay?" someone else asked. "Just a little light-headed," she said with a queasy smile.
DarkCorners	50	1603	1583	1633	Ben	someone else asked. "Just a little light-headed," she said with a queasy smile. [MASK]'s face loomed over her. It was clear he wasn't buying her explanation. "You need to finish the speech," she whispered to him.
DarkCorners	49	1644	1634	1683	Emily	"We can't...lose this opportunity." "[MASK]—" he started to protest, but she cut him off with a shake of her head. "I'll be fine," she said, grabbing his arm and pulling herself to her feet.
DarkCorners	57	1716	1664	1721	Emily	"I'll be fine," she said, grabbing his arm and pulling herself to her feet. She turned to face the crowd. "Too much caffeine," she said loudly. There were a few relieved chuckles, though others continued to murmur, confused. [MASK] stumbled off the stage.
DarkCorners	57	1862	1809	1866	Emily	She tried to focus on putting one foot in front of the other, but each step felt heavier than the last. Her body wasn't responding the way it should, and an overwhelming sense of confusion engulfed her. "Are you okay?" a concerned woman asked as [MASK] stumbled past her.
DarkCorners	50	2021	1984	2034	Emily	The world seemed to spin around her, and her head throbbed with pain. She couldn't make sense of it. Was it just nerves? Adrenaline? Or was it something more sinister? [MASK] struggled to think clearly, but her thoughts were muddled, elusive.
DarkCorners	45	2054	2035	2080	Emily	She couldn't even remember what she had eaten for breakfast that morning. "Get it together, [MASK]," she whispered to herself, taking deep breaths in an attempt to calm her racing heart. "You've got this."
DarkCorners	47	2086	2074	2121	Emily	"You've got this." Then, without warning, [MASK]'s chest tightened painfully. This couldn't simply be nerves or adrenaline; something was seriously wrong. She fumbled for her phone in her jeans pocket, determined to call for help.
DarkCorners	48	2219	2188	2236	Ben	Her legs gave out for a second time, and she collapsed to the ground, her phone slipping from her grasp. In the distance, she could still hear [MASK] speaking into the microphone, his voice peppered with humor that elicited laughter from the crowd.
DarkCorners	43	2263	2253	2296	Emily	"Help...please, someone help me," [MASK] whispered. But the sound was drowned by the cheers and laughter of the rally attendees. Darkness crept in at the edges of her vision, threatening to consume her entirely.
DarkCorners	53	2367	2324	2377	Dana	And then she succumbed to the darkness. CHAPTER ONE "Look, the Fourth Amendment clearly states that people have the right to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures," [MASK] said, warming to the argument by the second.
DarkCorners	48	2504	2482	2530	Mark	"Except when there's reasonable suspicion or probable cause," retorted one of her colleagues, a bespectacled agent named [MASK]. "We're dealing with a serial killer here. We can't afford to let them slip through our fingers over a technicality.
DarkCorners	53	2536	2516	2569	Dana	We can't afford to let them slip through our fingers over a technicality." "Technicality?" [MASK] repeated, crossing her arms over her chest and arching an eyebrow. Her sinewy muscles tensed as she planted her feet firmly on the ground, ready to defend her point.
DarkCorners	46	2582	2550	2596	Mark	Her sinewy muscles tensed as she planted her feet firmly on the ground, ready to defend her point. "You might want to brush up on your constitutional history, [MASK]. The Founding Fathers didn't put these protections in place for kicks.
DarkCorners	50	2936	2930	2980	Michaels	She sensed that her intellectualism threatened [MASK], who was an old school, blue-collar type who seemed to look down on anyone less senior than he was. Still, he was her boss, and she couldn't exactly go around avoiding him all the time.
DarkCorners	56	2999	2996	3052	Michaels	She tried calling [MASK], but the call went to voicemail. Where is he? she wondered. She considered heading to the gym for a Krav Maga session – it was one of her favorite ways of loosening up – but it felt irresponsible to do so now, with a new case looming.
DarkCorners	53	3481	3465	3518	Dana	"He's very concerned—it's a bad look, these deaths." [MASK] felt a stirring of unease. It wasn't often the mayor got involved in their investigations. Why had this case drawn his attention? "What's the case about?" she asked.
DarkCorners	41	3857	3848	3889	Dana	And with that, he hung up. As [MASK] stared at her phone, her thoughts swirled around the case. Why were these women targeted? Was it politically motivated, or was there something more personal at play?
DarkCorners	43	3927	3918	3961	Jake	As she zipped up her go-bag, [MASK], a fellow agent who had often been her sparring partner, appeared in her doorway, holding a file. "Hey," he said, extending the folder toward her.
DarkCorners	53	3982	3971	4024	Dana	" "Just leave it on the desk there," [MASK] said, pointing. As curious as she was to read the file, she needed to focus on getting everything ready before her flight. She would have plenty of time to read about the case while in the air.
DarkCorners	49	4025	3987	4036	Jake	As curious as she was to read the file, she needed to focus on getting everything ready before her flight. She would have plenty of time to read about the case while in the air. [MASK] hesitated, lingering. "Is there something else?"
DarkCorners	48	4037	4037	4085	Dana	[MASK] asked. "It's just…" He paused. "Seems like the kind of case that can make or break your career, you know? I don't know the details, but I heard a few of the agents talking about it.
DarkCorners	54	4087	4040	4094	Dana	"It's just…" He paused. "Seems like the kind of case that can make or break your career, you know? I don't know the details, but I heard a few of the agents talking about it." [MASK] nodded, unsure what to say.
DarkCorners	48	4179	4140	4188	Jake	"I'll be careful. No need to worry." He grinned, looking relieved. "Good. Wouldn't want to lose my sparring partner." "That would be a shame." [MASK] retreated a few steps, then turned back.
DarkCorners	52	4553	4553	4605	Dana	[MASK] couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more at play here. She mulled over the information, her brow furrowed as she tried to make sense of it all. These women, both so young and passionate about their work, had become targets—but why?
DarkCorners	51	4618	4616	4667	Dana	CHAPTER TWO [MASK]'s mind was still clouded with questions as she arrived at the crime scene, a deserted alley behind a temporary stage made of plywood and scaffolding. The area had been cleared by the police, and the bright yellow crime scene tape fluttered in the wind.
DarkCorners	49	4823	4816	4865	Dana	He was, in many ways, [MASK]'s opposite: street-smart where she was cerebral, pragmatic where she was idealistic, intuitive where she was analytical. Whether those differences would help or hinder them as a team, however, remained to be seen.
DarkCorners	48	5115	5113	5161	Dana	" As [MASK] studied the scene, her keen eyes caught a glimpse of something out of place—a phone, partially hidden beneath a discarded cardboard box. Its screen was cracked, and it lay in a small puddle of murky water near the wall.
DarkCorners	44	5173	5143	5187	Sam	Its screen was cracked, and it lay in a small puddle of murky water near the wall. It seemed that nobody else had noticed it yet. "[MASK], look at this," she said, pointing to the phone.
DarkCorners	54	5271	5248	5302	Dana	"We'll need to have the tech team analyze it for any recent activity." Before they could discuss further, [MASK] heard a man clear his throat behind them. She turned around to see a tall, lean man with a mop of curly brown hair and an apprehensive expression.
DarkCorners	49	5396	5351	5400	Dana	"I just wanted to see if there was anything I could do to help. I feel so...useless, you know?" "Actually, we were hoping you could tell us more about what happened during the rally," [MASK] said, rising.
DarkCorners	54	5431	5428	5482	Emily	"Well, [MASK] was delivering her speech when she suddenly collapsed. She told me she was light-headed and said something about caffeine, but I..." He took a quick, anxious breath. "I knew better. I should've taken her to the hospital right then.
DarkCorners	53	5509	5459	5512	Dana	He took a quick, anxious breath. "I knew better. I should've taken her to the hospital right then. But the show must go on, right?" His smile was clouded with bitter self-condemnation. "What happened next?" [MASK] asked gently.
DarkCorners	41	5513	5513	5554	Ben	[MASK] shrugged, looking suddenly detached. "She insisted on leaving the stage, so I took over for her. We worked really hard to set this event up, and neither of us wanted to lose the opportunity.
DarkCorners	58	5587	5535	5593	Sam	We worked really hard to set this event up, and neither of us wanted to lose the opportunity. After I finished speaking, I came back here to check on her...and found her like this." "Did you notice anything unusual during the event?" [MASK] asked, his brow furrowing.
DarkCorners	50	5652	5635	5685	Dana	It all just happened so fast." "Did she have any health concerns?" [MASK] asked. "Allergies, anything like that?" "No, I don't think so. She was as healthy as a clam, as she liked to say.
DarkCorners	47	5717	5672	5719	Sam	She was as healthy as a clam, as she liked to say. She got her idioms mixed up sometimes." He pressed his lips together in a sad smile. "Did you notice any suspicious individuals in the crowd?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	47	5733	5720	5767	Ben	"Anyone you thought you needed to keep an eye on?" [MASK] looked puzzled. "What are you asking? Are you suggesting someone…" He paused, as if he couldn't quite figure out how to frame what he was thinking.
DarkCorners	48	5775	5737	5785	Dana	"What are you asking? Are you suggesting someone…" He paused, as if he couldn't quite figure out how to frame what he was thinking. "We don't know," [MASK] said gently. "We're considering all possibilities.
DarkCorners	50	5815	5812	5862	Ben	She watched as [MASK]'s face, which had slowly transformed from shock to grief, now turned back to shock again. "I didn't see anybody suspicious, no," he said in a quiet voice. "These were kind, well-intentioned people.
DarkCorners	48	5916	5876	5924	Ben	Anyone who might've wanted to harm her?" "Enemies? Sure, there were people who didn't like her political views, but to think someone would go as far as to harm her..." [MASK] trailed off, shaking his head again.
DarkCorners	46	5979	5951	5997	Ben	"We'll be in touch if we need anything else. In the meantime, try to get some rest." "Sure thing," [MASK] replied, his eyes looking hollow. He forced a weak smile before retreating from the scene.
DarkCorners	42	6127	6126	6168	Sam	"[MASK]," she called out quietly, not wanting to disturb his phone conversation. He looked over at her, noticing the urgency in her gaze. "Hold on a minute," he said into the phone.
DarkCorners	51	6183	6156	6207	Dana	"Hold on a minute," he said into the phone. Then he cradled the phone against his shoulder and raised his eyebrows expectantly at [MASK]. "Look at this," she said, pointing to the puncture wound. "What do you make of it?
DarkCorners	47	6209	6185	6232	Sam	"Look at this," she said, pointing to the puncture wound. "What do you make of it?" [MASK] studied the tiny mark, his expression growing serious. "It could be from a needle. A very fine one.
DarkCorners	50	6259	6246	6296	Emily	"If someone used a needle like this to inject poison rapidly into [MASK]'s bloodstream, they could've killed her without anyone noticing. It would explain the lack of struggle and other physical injuries." "An assassin hiding in plain sight during the rally?"
DarkCorners	44	6367	6334	6378	Sam	But who had gotten close enough to prick her with a needle? "Let me finish this call, and we'll go over everything we've found so far," [MASK] said, lifting his phone to his ear once more.
DarkCorners	41	6444	6416	6457	Dana	Toward the far end of the alley, she spotted an inconspicuous piece of parchment wedged between a trash can and the brick wall of a building. [MASK] carefully retrieved the parchment, turning it over in her gloved hands.
DarkCorners	49	6483	6458	6507	Dana	On it, written in a careful, cursive hand, was a collection of letters without any apparent meaning: "epghdfeforsdahtbomceiiernge." [MASK] stared at the letters, trying to make sense of them. What did they mean? Anything? Or was it nonsense?
DarkCorners	49	6645	6634	6683	Sam	How was she to know? Behind her, she heard [MASK] pacing back and forth as he spoke with a lab technician about the phone. She felt a sudden urge to solve this puzzle before he joined her—it was in her nature to be competitive.
DarkCorners	47	6761	6720	6767	Sam	It only took her a few moments more to crack the rest and then piece it all together. "'Abridging the freedom of speech,'" she said aloud. "What are you talking about?" [MASK] asked as he joined her.
DarkCorners	47	6807	6788	6835	Sam	"It's a quote from the First Amendment. It could be our killer's signature." [MASK] studied the parchment. "How'd you crack this so quickly?" She shrugged modestly. "Played a lot of Scrabble as a kid.
DarkCorners	48	6892	6862	6910	Dana	He shook his head, his hazel eyes narrowing in thought. "A signature—you know what this means, right?" "It means," [MASK] said, "that our killer has an agenda. And he'll probably strike again."
DarkCorners	53	7068	7056	7109	Dana	They'd worked together on several high-profile cases, and [MASK] respected his meticulous nature and expertise in forensic pathology. He was in his mid-fifties, with salt-and-pepper hair, and he wore round glasses that gave him an air of intelligence and approachability.
DarkCorners	56	7415	7375	7431	Dana	"Now that you mention it, he did say that she walked into the crowd to interview an attendee—a teenage girl." "That's probably when the killer stuck her with the needle," [MASK] murmured. "I doubt anyone would have noticed in all that chaos, though.
DarkCorners	53	7521	7470	7523	Dana	"It's possible, but given the nature of a needle prick, it's doubtful. I'll still take swabs and send them through our lab just in case, of course." "Any idea how long it might take for the toxicology report?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	47	7587	7542	7589	Dana	We're backed up at the moment, and the tests themselves can be time-consuming. But I promise to get the results to you as soon as they're available." "We really can't afford to wait," [MASK] said.
DarkCorners	53	7694	7693	7746	Dana	" [MASK] tried to contain her disappointment. She understood where he was coming from, however. They would just have to do the best they could with the information they had. "Do you have any theories on what poison could've been used?" she asked, pivoting.
DarkCorners	53	7843	7792	7845	Dana	Another possibility is tetrodotoxin, which is found in pufferfish venom. It's extremely potent and can lead to rapid paralysis and death. Of course, there are other options, but we won't know until the toxicology report comes in." "Of course," [MASK] said.
DarkCorners	52	8461	8428	8480	Dana	"You don't think...is that the connection? Free speech and freedom of assembly?" "You think the killer has a problem with the First Amendment?" [MASK] nodded thoughtfully. "It's a possibility. Or it could be a twisted interpretation of it.
DarkCorners	50	8488	8465	8515	Julia	"It's a possibility. Or it could be a twisted interpretation of it. We'll need to dig deeper into [MASK]'s background and her involvement in those protests." As she spoke, her eyes drifted toward a group of people gathered on the sidewalk.
DarkCorners	53	8531	8498	8551	Sam	" As she spoke, her eyes drifted toward a group of people gathered on the sidewalk. They were holding signs and chanting slogans, their voices carrying across the street. [MASK] followed her gaze and frowned. "Looks like another protest. Wonder what it's about this time.
DarkCorners	55	8599	8567	8622	Sam	"Is it possible the two women had some other political stance in common, something that put them at risk from a violent extremist group?" "Maybe," [MASK] said, his eyes narrowing in thought. "You think the killer was part of a group?" She shrugged.
DarkCorners	47	8663	8623	8670	Dana	"I don't know what to think. I just don't want to assume anything. Let's keep digging—there could be more connections we're missing." As she scanned the file again, [MASK]'s eyes caught on a pattern.
DarkCorners	56	8799	8799	8855	Dana	[MASK] made a quick search on her phone. "It's called the Philadelphia Public Assembly Board," she said. "Their purpose is to review and approve permits for public events, including protests and rallies." "Alright, so both victims had to get permission from this board..."
DarkCorners	44	8872	8840	8884	Dana	" "Alright, so both victims had to get permission from this board..." He rubbed his clean-shaven cheek. "What does that tell us?" [MASK] looked up article after article, reading about the public events.
DarkCorners	47	8948	8948	8995	Sam	[MASK] said, pulling out his own phone. He tapped rapidly at the screen. "According to what I'm seeing, it appears he's a constitutional law professor at a local university. Has some...interesting political views." "Interesting?
DarkCorners	52	9033	8992	9044	Dana	" "Interesting? How so?" "For example, he's argued in favor of abolishing the Electoral College system altogether and replacing it with something he calls 'direct democracy.'" "Wow," [MASK] mused, trying to imagine what that would look like.
DarkCorners	54	9084	9045	9099	Dana	"Any other noteworthy stances?" "He also thinks the Confederacy should've been allowed to exist," he said. "And that states should have the right to secede from the Union." [MASK] raised an eyebrow. "So he's a bit of a controversial figure.
DarkCorners	45	9112	9100	9145	Sam	" "That's certainly one way to put it," [MASK] said, scrolling through more articles. "Looks like he's been in the news quite a bit lately, giving interviews and op-eds on all sorts of issues.
DarkCorners	48	9323	9285	9333	Sam	The late morning sun peeked through the thick canopy of leaves, casting a dappled light on the quiet street. "According to the university secretary I spoke with, he canceled his classes today," [MASK] replied, keeping his gaze trained on the entrance.
DarkCorners	46	9518	9499	9545	Dana	"We need to talk with him directly, see what he has to say for himself," [MASK] said. "I want to catch him off-guard, see how he reacts to seeing two FBI agents showing up on his doorstep.
DarkCorners	46	9560	9521	9567	Sam	"I want to catch him off-guard, see how he reacts to seeing two FBI agents showing up on his doorstep." "Well, it might be a bit late for that," [MASK] said, gesturing at the mansion.
DarkCorners	56	9628	9622	9678	Dana	As they approached the house, [MASK] couldn't help but admire its grandeur. The mansion was nestled in a secluded area surrounded by tall, ancient trees that cast long shadows on the gravel path leading up to the entrance. The lawn was immaculate and vibrant, without a single dead leaf anywhere.
DarkCorners	48	9684	9665	9713	Sam	The lawn was immaculate and vibrant, without a single dead leaf anywhere. "Nice place," [MASK] muttered, his eyes scanning the surroundings as if searching for any hidden threat. "Tells you a lot about the professor, doesn't it?"
DarkCorners	56	9804	9802	9858	Dana	Then, [MASK] heard the sound of approaching footsteps. The door finally opened, and a man poked his head out. He was in his early sixties, with gray hair and sharp, calculating eyes framed by deep lines etched into his forehead—a testament to years of intense study and debate.
DarkCorners	53	10022	10022	10075	Grimes	[MASK] nodded warily. "Yes. Why?" "Those two women my partner mentioned both requested permission from your board to hold public rallies, one this morning and another a week ago. According to what I've heard, you were the only one who opposed their request.
DarkCorners	46	10134	10090	10136	Sam	"Yes, I remember now. I deemed their rallies to be a threat to public safety. I didn't want any incidents to occur." "So it had nothing to do with disagreeing with their political beliefs?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	50	10217	10193	10243	Sam	We only need a few minutes of your time, and then you can go about your day." The professor stared at [MASK] a few seconds longer, as if to drive home a point, before turning and retreating into the house, leaving the door open.
DarkCorners	50	10303	10300	10350	Grimes	As they followed [MASK] further into his home, it seemed he couldn't help but talk about the house. "This house belonged to my great-grandfather," he said, clearly proud of his heritage. "He made his fortune in the shipping industry.
DarkCorners	48	10421	10374	10422	Grimes	A large fireplace dominated one wall, its mantel displaying various antique trinkets. Plush armchairs and sofas were arranged around a coffee table adorned with books on history and constitutional law. The room exuded an air of intellectualism that seemed fitting for a professor like [MASK].
DarkCorners	54	10503	10498	10552	Grimes	Is that true?" [MASK] nodded, relaxing slightly. "Yes, I've been a professor there for over twenty years." "Which subjects do you teach?" she asked. "Constitutional law and political philosophy," he replied, the pride in his voice evident.
DarkCorners	51	10581	10535	10586	Dana	"Constitutional law and political philosophy," he replied, the pride in his voice evident. "I like to think I'm helping to shape the minds of the next generation of leaders." "That's a noble profession," [MASK] said with a smile.
DarkCorners	41	10613	10612	10653	Grimes	" [MASK] leaned forward, his eyes sparking with intensity. "Absolutely. I believe that the current administration is systematically dismantling the foundations of our democracy. We need to resist this erosion of our fundamental rights and values.
DarkCorners	50	10793	10782	10832	Grimes	"Would you mind sharing your thoughts with us?" [MASK] straightened up, his eyes narrowing. "I believe the amendments to the Constitution are outdated. The government has grown too large, too controlling. They've encroached upon the freedoms they claim to protect.
DarkCorners	45	10834	10801	10846	Sam	"I believe the amendments to the Constitution are outdated. The government has grown too large, too controlling. They've encroached upon the freedoms they claim to protect." [MASK] cocked his head, as if studying a particularly colorful insect.
DarkCorners	53	10875	10847	10900	Grimes	"But the First Amendment is all about protecting freedom of speech, religion, and the press, isn't it?" "True," [MASK] said, his voice growing more passionate. "But who enforces the First Amendment? The same government that seeks to control us.
DarkCorners	54	10925	10892	10946	Grimes	The same government that seeks to control us. It's a paradox, you see. They grant us these freedoms only to restrict them when it suits their purposes." [MASK]' fingers twitched on the armrests of his chair, hinting at an undercurrent of emotion beneath his philosophical diatribe.
DarkCorners	41	11081	11075	11116	Grimes	" "Absolutely not!" [MASK] said, his face flushing crimson. "I took the day off to catch up on my research—a book I'm writing. I have no interest in attending those rallies.
DarkCorners	49	11128	11108	11157	Sam	I have no interest in attending those rallies." "We're not accusing you of anything," [MASK] said in a mild tone. "You have to admit, though, that your absence from work is a little...curious, considering the circumstances.
DarkCorners	41	11230	11230	11271	Grimes	[MASK] shook his head, frustration etched in the lines around his mouth. "No. Before I could say anything, she collapsed on stage. After that, there was nothing left for me to do but leave.
DarkCorners	42	11445	11416	11458	Dana	"I was there from Tuesday until Friday evening. You can check with the hotel and airline if you'd like to verify my claim." As [MASK] processed this information, she felt a mix of relief and disappointment.
DarkCorners	43	11600	11585	11628	Dana	As they stepped into the crisp autumn air, the scent of fallen leaves filled [MASK]'s nostrils, and she took a deep breath and tried to clear her thoughts. "Are we really just going to let him go?"
DarkCorners	46	12063	12063	12109	Claire	[MASK] was taller than her sister, with long curly hair that framed her face in a halo of auburn curls. She was dressed in a loose-fitting sweater and jeans, her bare feet tucked beneath her on the couch where she sat.
DarkCorners	44	12121	12085	12129	Dana	She was dressed in a loose-fitting sweater and jeans, her bare feet tucked beneath her on the couch where she sat. I wish I could just let her grieve in peace, [MASK] thought wearily. But we need answers.
DarkCorners	52	12212	12211	12263	Emily	"[MASK] was…she was passionate about everything she did. Her friends meant the world to her, and she would do anything to help them. She was involved in all sorts of community projects—organizing food drives, tutoring underprivileged kids, advocating for affordable housing."
DarkCorners	56	12347	12347	12403	Claire	[MASK] wiped her eyes, determination filling her expression. "Politics was her lifeblood. It started in college when she joined the student government. After graduation, she became a community organizer for Citizens for Social Justice. She led campaigns for better education funding, healthcare reform, and clean energy initiatives.
DarkCorners	50	12411	12374	12424	Claire	After graduation, she became a community organizer for Citizens for Social Justice. She led campaigns for better education funding, healthcare reform, and clean energy initiatives. But most of all" – here [MASK]'s voice rose in intensity – "she fought for government transparency.
DarkCorners	47	12497	12469	12516	Emily	The fight for government transparency was not without its enemies—people in power who would do anything to protect their secrets. It seemed increasingly plausible that [MASK]'s murder had been politically motivated. Still, they couldn't rule out a more personal connection.
DarkCorners	46	12597	12559	12605	Claire	"Even the kindest people, though, can fall under criticism. Did she have any enemies that you know of? Anyone who might have held a grudge against her because of her work?" [MASK] shook her head, her brow furrowing.
DarkCorners	46	12656	12616	12662	Dana	She was so kind-hearted and always tried to understand people's perspectives, even if they didn't agree with her. Honestly, I don't think she had a malicious bone in her body." [MASK] nodded, not really surprised.
DarkCorners	51	12701	12682	12733	Dana	"Sorry to interrupt, but do you mind if I use your bathroom?" His eyes met [MASK]'s for a brief moment, and she had the distinct impression that he wasn't really interested in using the bathroom. He just wanted an excuse to poke around.
DarkCorners	43	12771	12763	12806	Emily	"To answer your question, no, [MASK] wasn't seeing anyone. She's been single for a while. Liked to say she didn't have the time or energy for a relationship, not with all her activism work.
DarkCorners	47	12846	12807	12854	Claire	But she did have close friends within her organization, people who understood her passion and supported her in every way possible." "And you're sure she would tell you about something like that?" [MASK] smiled sadly. "Oh, yes.
DarkCorners	42	13044	13026	13068	Claire	"Thanks for letting me use your bathroom," he said. "Of course," [MASK] replied, dabbing at her eyes with a tissue. The emotional weight of the conversation had clearly taken its toll on her.
DarkCorners	50	13128	13099	13149	Claire	Would you mind if we took a quick look? It might help us understand her better and figure out who could have done this to her." [MASK] hesitated, her eyes darting toward the hallway. She clearly didn't want to disturb her sister's belongings.
DarkCorners	51	13206	13178	13229	Claire	"We'll be respectful, I promise. We just need any information we can get to help solve this case." After a moment, [MASK] nodded, acquiescing to their request. "Okay. But, please, try not to move things around, okay?
DarkCorners	44	13246	13214	13258	Dana	"Okay. But, please, try not to move things around, okay? I want to keep everything the way she did, at least for now." [MASK] smiled gently. "We understand. We'll be careful.
DarkCorners	41	13279	13279	13320	Claire	[MASK] paused, as if gathering her will. Then, with a deep breath, she pushed the door open. The early afternoon sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a warm, golden glow upon the room.
DarkCorners	42	13388	13387	13429	Dana	As [MASK] walked around the room, she took note of the details: a worn pair of running shoes by the door, a yoga mat rolled up in the corner, and an open notebook on a small wooden desk.
DarkCorners	53	13577	13577	13630	Claire	[MASK] thought for a moment, then said, "Well, she did have a habit of going for long runs when she felt overwhelmed or stressed. It helped clear her mind. And she practiced yoga almost daily. Other than that, I can't think of anything specific.
DarkCorners	48	13632	13606	13654	Dana	It helped clear her mind. And she practiced yoga almost daily. Other than that, I can't think of anything specific." [MASK] nodded, taking in the information. Every detail mattered, no matter how insignificant it might seem in the moment.
DarkCorners	49	13715	13698	13747	Claire	she asked, gesturing at the book. "Yes, she journaled almost daily," [MASK] said with a nod. "She found writing therapeutic and believed it helped her process her thoughts and feelings." "Would you happen to know the combination?"
DarkCorners	49	13751	13751	13800	Claire	[MASK] hesitated as she stared at the journal. "No, I don't. And, to be honest, I'm not sure if I should share my sister's private thoughts. Even if it might help the investigation, it just feels...wrong.
DarkCorners	56	13859	13834	13890	Claire	"However, there might be something in this journal that could lead us to her killer. Isn't that more important?" [MASK] sighed, her shoulders slumping. "You're right," she said. "If there's any chance it could help, then we have to try.
DarkCorners	51	13892	13891	13942	Claire	" [MASK] picked up the journal and began attempting various combinations, murmuring to herself as she did so. She tried significant dates, favorite numbers, and other meaningful sequences, but none of them seemed to work. Frustration crept into her expression as she shook her head.
DarkCorners	44	13989	13979	14023	Claire	"What were her passions, her inspirations?" [MASK] paused, deep in thought. Then, suddenly, her face brightened. "Of course!" she exclaimed, quickly dialing in a new combination and successfully unlocking the journal.
DarkCorners	53	14037	13996	14049	Emily	Then, suddenly, her face brightened. "Of course!" she exclaimed, quickly dialing in a new combination and successfully unlocking the journal. "It's 1789, the year the U.S. Constitution was adopted. [MASK] was so passionate about constitutional rights—it makes perfect sense.
DarkCorners	41	14205	14192	14233	Dana	"Most of it seems to be related to her activism," [MASK] replied, her finger tracing the ink on the page as she continued to read. "I'm not sure we'll find anything useful here.
DarkCorners	59	14269	14244	14303	Dana	There was no sound but the turning pages and the distant hum of traffic outside the window. With each entry that proved fruitless, [MASK] couldn't help but feel a growing sense of frustration and doubt. Just as she was beginning to lose hope, however, an entry from a month ago caught her eye.
DarkCorners	56	14328	14323	14379	Emily	According to the journal, [MASK] had seen him multiple times before, always watching her intently. She'd run into him several times around town – at the grocery store, the park, and the library – and had completely changed her routine because of him, avoiding all three of those locations.
DarkCorners	47	14559	14550	14597	Petra	Even with the windows rolled up, some of [MASK]'s words managed to reach the man's ears. "Freedom of speech is our most powerful weapon," she cried with impassioned zeal. "It's the very essence of our democracy!"
DarkCorners	49	14757	14729	14778	Petra	He had followed her to events like this one, listening intently and taking mental notes, always staying just far enough away to avoid detection. As [MASK] continued her speech, the man rolled down his window, allowing the crisp autumn air to fill his car.
DarkCorners	51	14932	14895	14946	Petra	The fervor with which they clung to her every word, the adoration in their eyes as they gazed at her like a modern-day messiah. "Change is coming, my friends!" [MASK] continued. "You bet your ass it is," he thought.
DarkCorners	46	15154	15121	15167	Petra	Despite the festive atmosphere around him, he had a job to do—a mission that would not be deterred by sentimentality or distraction. "Remember, my friends," [MASK]'s voice rang out, amplified by the speakers surrounding the stage.
DarkCorners	49	15212	15168	15217	Petra	"Freedom of speech is not just a right—it is a responsibility! We must use our voices to speak out against injustice, to hold those in power accountable!" The crowd roared with approval, clapping and cheering as [MASK] continued her impassioned plea.
DarkCorners	50	15274	15274	15324	Petra	[MASK] cried, waving a hand through the air with vigor. "Together, we can create change and build a brighter future for everyone!" "Bravo!" the man called out, forcing a smile onto his face as he joined the throng of people.
DarkCorners	58	15347	15306	15364	Petra	the man called out, forcing a smile onto his face as he joined the throng of people. He clapped along with them, mimicking their enthusiasm, though inwardly seething with disgust. He kept his eyes locked on [MASK] as she stood tall on the stage, basking in the adoration of her misguided followers.
DarkCorners	47	15385	15365	15412	Petra	"And let us not forget those who have fought and died for our right to speak freely," [MASK] said, her tone solemn now. "Their sacrifices will never be forgotten, and it is our duty to continue their fight for freedom.
DarkCorners	51	15472	15434	15485	Petra	The man took advantage of the quiet moment to inch closer to the stage, his movements slow and deliberate so as not to draw any unwanted attention. "Thank you all for coming today," [MASK] said, her green eyes scanning the sea of faces before her.
DarkCorners	53	15538	15493	15546	Petra	Let's make our voices heard!" The crowd erupted into thunderous applause, their cheers reverberating through the square like a triumphant battle cry. The man, however, did not cheer. He simply stood there, his eyes fixed on [MASK] as the smile fell from his face.
DarkCorners	45	15555	15547	15592	Petra	"Thank you, thank you," [MASK] said, stepping down from the stage and into the throngs of her supporters. She shook hands, posed for photographs, and exchanged pleasantries with the people who had come to see her speak.
DarkCorners	54	15604	15571	15625	Petra	She shook hands, posed for photographs, and exchanged pleasantries with the people who had come to see her speak. The man entered the queue of those waiting to speak with [MASK]. He could feel the sweat beginning to form on his brow as he shuffled forward, inch by inch.
DarkCorners	47	15645	15626	15673	Petra	The rhythmic chatter of the crowd filled his ears, a cacophony of voices united in their support for [MASK]'s cause. The man forced a grin onto his face as though he shared their enthusiasm. His heart, however, held nothing but contempt.
DarkCorners	52	15685	15664	15716	Petra	His heart, however, held nothing but contempt. "Thank you so much for your kind words," [MASK] said to the woman in front of the man, clearly touched by the outpouring of support. She beamed at the woman before turning her attention to the man.
DarkCorners	51	15740	15704	15755	Petra	She beamed at the woman before turning her attention to the man. "Hello," she said warmly, extending her hand. "Thank you for coming today." "Hi, [MASK]," the man replied, taking her hand and looking into her eyes.
DarkCorners	51	15783	15777	15828	Petra	" "Thank you," [MASK] said with a practiced smile. That smile, however, faltered ever so slightly as the man held onto her hand for a moment too long. He made sure to maintain eye contact, watching her discomfort grow, reveling in it.
DarkCorners	52	15890	15871	15923	Petra	" "Thanks again," he said finally, releasing her hand. "Of course," [MASK] replied, trying to regain her composure as she turned to greet the next person in line. Her eyes darted back to the man, suspicions stirred but not fully awakened.
DarkCorners	51	15976	15947	15998	Petra	With practiced ease, he flicked off the protective cap and allowed it to drop to the ground, unnoticed. Seizing his opportunity, the man brushed past [MASK] as if making toward the street on the far side of her, feigning a stumble as he bumped into her.
DarkCorners	50	16036	16024	16074	Petra	He quickly withdrew the needle, his movements fluid and inconspicuous. [MASK] absently slapped at her arm, as if thinking a bug had bitten her. "Sorry," the man murmured, avoiding eye contact as he backed away, his head lowered in faux embarrassment.
DarkCorners	51	16378	16364	16415	Petra	As he drove away, he cast a final glance toward the stage where [MASK] continued to speak with her supporters. She rubbed her arm, frowning in confusion or perhaps discomfort. A thrill of anticipation coursed through the man as he imagined the poison coursing through her veins.
DarkCorners	45	16499	16492	16537	Julia	She could almost hear the sound of [MASK]'s voice resonating through the air, her words full of conviction as the crowd clapped and cheered in response. "Hard to believe it was just a week ago," she muttered to herself.
DarkCorners	53	16630	16604	16657	Sam	A chill in the air hinted at winter's approach, and the gentle rustling of leaves provided an unsettling soundtrack. "Here," [MASK] said, pointing to his phone screen, which displayed the crime scene photos. "The stage was set up near that cluster of bushes.
DarkCorners	46	16696	16658	16704	Julia	The crowd gathered mainly on this side, closer to the street." He gestured toward a patch of trampled grass and scattered debris, remnants of the horde that had once filled the area. "[MASK] collapsed right there, by that lamppost.
DarkCorners	51	16872	16834	16885	Sam	"Let's expand our search," she said, her gaze sweeping over the park. "Check the areas surrounding the stage and the crowd." "What are we looking for?" [MASK] asked. She shook her head, her lips pressed tightly together.
DarkCorners	52	16891	16875	16927	Dana	She shook her head, her lips pressed tightly together. "Anything." As [MASK] walked, she took note of the park's features: the winding pathways, clusters of benches, and a small playground tucked away in a corner, now devoid of laughter and play.
DarkCorners	43	16964	16928	16971	Dana	She moved methodically, her eyes scanning every inch for potential evidence. She spotted a trash can and, donning a pair of latex gloves, she began pawing through it. "Hey, [MASK], come look at this!"
DarkCorners	42	17060	17031	17073	Dana	The carving looked recent, the wood beneath the bark still fresh and pale, contrasting starkly with the dark outer layer. "Another coded message?" [MASK] asked, eyebrows furrowing in concentration as she studied the enigmatic sequence.
DarkCorners	46	17202	17165	17211	Sam	"Give me a moment," she murmured, mentally rearranging the letters. Her eyes widened as she suddenly realized the message. "Peaceably to assemble," she said, looking up at [MASK]. "It's another First Amendment quote.
DarkCorners	47	17293	17248	17295	Sam	"The killer is trying to send us a message. He's targeting activists and leaving First Amendment quotes behind. But why? What is he trying to achieve?" "Maybe it's his way of challenging the system," [MASK] suggested.
DarkCorners	43	17359	17332	17375	Julia	"Look, we're not getting anywhere with these coded messages alone," he said. "We need to speak with someone who knew [MASK]. Maybe they can provide some insight into her life and why she was targeted.
DarkCorners	47	17384	17361	17408	Dana	Maybe they can provide some insight into her life and why she was targeted." "Probably a good idea," [MASK] said. "Because whatever message the killer is sending, we'd better crack it quick—before anyone else gets hurt.
DarkCorners	51	17413	17387	17438	Dana	"Because whatever message the killer is sending, we'd better crack it quick—before anyone else gets hurt." * * * [MASK] watched the older woman playing with the toddler in the fenced-off yard, her gray hair pinned up in a loose bun.
DarkCorners	44	17506	17505	17549	Julia	"[MASK]'s grandmother. According to the website, she's been running this daycare for almost a decade now." The small playground outside the modest house buzzed with the energy of children, their laughter and shouts filling the air.
DarkCorners	43	17807	17799	17842	Julia	She could see the resemblance between her and [MASK]. The afternoon sun, only a few hours from setting, cast a warm glow on the playground as leaves drifted lazily from the trees, scattering in shades of orange and gold.
DarkCorners	44	17847	17809	17853	Julia	The afternoon sun, only a few hours from setting, cast a warm glow on the playground as leaves drifted lazily from the trees, scattering in shades of orange and gold. "Were you and [MASK] close?" she asked.
DarkCorners	50	17920	17905	17955	Julia	"We used to bake cookies every Sunday. It was our little tradition. [MASK] loved trying out new recipes, and we'd spend hours in the kitchen laughing and making a mess." Her gaze shifted back to the children playing, watching over them protectively.
DarkCorners	47	18035	18029	18076	Cherish	"Off and on," [MASK] admitted. "She had a few boyfriends over the years, but nothing serious. She was so focused on her career and making a difference in the world, she didn't want anything to hold her back.
DarkCorners	47	18148	18124	18171	Cherish	"Were any of them involved in politics or activism like her?" "Most of her friends shared her interests," [MASK] said, her eyes scanning the playground as a child's laughter rang out. "They met through college or work.
DarkCorners	55	18192	18192	18247	Cherish	[MASK] shook her head. "No, I don't think so," she replied. "She was passionate about her causes, but she never went out of her way to make enemies. If anything, people admired her dedication and willingness to stand up for what she believed in.
DarkCorners	49	18253	18230	18279	Dana	If anything, people admired her dedication and willingness to stand up for what she believed in." As they spoke, [MASK] watched the same toddler she'd noticed before wobble unsteadily across the playground. The little boy tripped over a protruding tree root and fell.
DarkCorners	47	18306	18301	18348	Cherish	"Excuse me," [MASK] said, her voice full of concern as she hurried over to the crying child. She scooped him up into her arms, soothing him with gentle words. "We'd better head inside and take care of this.
DarkCorners	54	18408	18373	18427	Cherish	The walls were adorned with family photos and children's artwork, creating a warm atmosphere. A well-worn couch sat opposite a sturdy wooden coffee table littered with toys and books. [MASK] settled the boy on the couch and carefully rolled up his pant leg, revealing the skinned knee.
DarkCorners	47	18457	18428	18475	Batman	She moved with practiced ease, wetting a soft cloth in a nearby sink and dabbing at the wound to clean it. "You're as brave as [MASK]," she said, causing the boy's face to brighten suddenly. "Really?"
DarkCorners	54	18670	18668	18722	Julia	It depicted [MASK] during a heated debate with a young man in his twenties. He was tall and lean, with a mop of curly dark hair that seemed to have a life of its own. His eyes were intense, narrowed in concentration, his hands gripping the podium like vises.
DarkCorners	49	18964	18922	18971	Dana	It was uncalled for, and I could tell it deeply hurt her. She tried to brush it off, but I know my granddaughter—she was affected." "Then why did she have it framed?" [MASK] asked. "She didn't.
DarkCorners	50	19131	19083	19133	Sam	" "Of course. Please…just find out what happened to my granddaughter. She didn't deserve this." The older woman's gaze was firm, but there was a slight tremble to her mouth. "We will, ma'am," [MASK] said.
DarkCorners	42	19263	19232	19274	Dana	"And vocal, too. Got into a number of heated political arguments. Want to guess the name of one of the people he argued with most?" [MASK] paused, thinking about it. Then it hit her.
DarkCorners	52	19395	19370	19422	Sam	The house was shrouded in darkness, offering no clues to its occupant's whereabouts. "He's gotta be home," [MASK] said, gesturing toward an old sedan parked haphazardly near the garage, its tired paint chipping away. "Someone must be home, anyway.
DarkCorners	47	19496	19471	19518	Dana	The lawn was unkempt, overgrown weeds snaking their way across the property, a testament to the owner's reclusive nature. Just as [MASK] was about to knock on the door for the third time, she heard a voice call out from behind them.
DarkCorners	50	19545	19519	19569	Eichmann	She turned her head and saw a middle-aged man, slightly balding with a graying beard, leaning over a wooden fence that separated [MASK]'s house from his neighbor's. His eyes were a piercing blue that seemed to hold a mixture of curiosity and concern.
DarkCorners	48	19633	19617	19665	Sam	" "Is he in some sort of trouble?" "No trouble," [MASK] said with a disarming smile. "Just need to speak with him about an acquaintance of his. Is he home?" "Yes, I imagine so."
DarkCorners	50	19729	19702	19752	Dana	He's become quite a recluse. Doesn't talk much to anyone, not even to me, and we used to be close." [MASK] was intrigued. "Do you know what changed?" The neighbor sighed, running a hand through his thinning hair.
DarkCorners	49	19808	19761	19810	Sam	He's always been a bit eccentric, but it's gotten worse over the past few months. He's become increasingly paranoid, jumping at shadows and the like." "Do you think you could get him to talk to us?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	48	19849	19811	19859	Dana	The neighbor made a regretful face, his eyes full of sympathy. "I doubt it. The last time I tried to speak with him, he practically slammed the door in my face." [MASK] nodded, doing her best to hide her disappointment.
DarkCorners	49	19921	19883	19932	Sam	My wife's got a doctor's appointment, and I promised her I'd be there." He gave them a final nod before disappearing back into his yard. "Thanks, anyway!" [MASK] called, then dropped the smile and shook his head.
DarkCorners	42	19993	19964	20006	Sam	"We need a new approach," she said. "Banging on the door clearly isn't working. Do you have any other ideas?" [MASK] shrugged. "Kick down the door? Claim we smelled smoke?
DarkCorners	44	20012	19996	20040	Dana	"Kick down the door? Claim we smelled smoke?" A sudden idea struck [MASK]. "Worth a shot," she muttered to herself. Pulling out her badge, she raised it in front of one of the windows.
DarkCorners	49	20070	20057	20106	Dana	We know you're home." At first nothing happened. Then [MASK] heard the sound of movement from within the house. The door creaked open a few inches, revealing a suspicious pair of eyes peering out at them from beneath a mop of unkempt hair.
DarkCorners	45	20265	20237	20282	Dana	"It was nothing," he muttered, still holding the door partially closed. "Just a discussion about politics." "Really?" [MASK] asked, her keen eyes picking up on the minute ticks in his expression and posture.
DarkCorners	54	20305	20283	20337	Eichmann	"Our sources mentioned that you made it personal." "I don't know who your sources are," [MASK] said, his eyes narrowing, "but they're clearly misinformed. I never attacked her personally. We disagreed, sure, but that's what debates are for.
DarkCorners	49	20356	20356	20405	Eichmann	[MASK]'s jaw clenched, and he took a deep breath before saying, "Look, I don't have to answer any more of your questions. I want you both off my property, now." With that, he started to close the door.
DarkCorners	43	20507	20499	20542	Sam	"What are you talking about?" [MASK] took a deep breath with an air of reluctance, as if hating to share a piece of bad news. "This can go one of two ways, as I see it.
DarkCorners	53	20658	20626	20679	Eichmann	You'll have news vans watching your every move, reporters hounding you for interviews, and your life will be an open book. Is that what you want?" [MASK]'s face paled, and he hesitated for a long moment before finally sighing and stepping back from the door.
DarkCorners	55	20734	20734	20789	Eichmann	[MASK] led them into a small living room cluttered with old newspapers, takeout containers, and empty beer cans. He gestured for them to take a seat on a lumpy couch before perching on an armchair across from them. "Okay," he said, his gaze darting nervously between them.
DarkCorners	48	20866	20856	20904	Eichmann	You didn't argue about anything in particular?" [MASK] shifted in his seat. "We talked about a lot of things—the Constitution, mainly. She was a big supporter of the document, while I thought it could use some...changes.
DarkCorners	43	20913	20872	20915	Sam	"We talked about a lot of things—the Constitution, mainly. She was a big supporter of the document, while I thought it could use some...changes." "What kind of changes?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	41	20957	20922	20963	Julia	"Nothing drastic," he said finally. "Just some amendments to reflect the current state of our society. Like gun control laws, for example." "And how did [MASK] respond to your proposals?"
DarkCorners	43	20979	20967	21010	Eichmann	"She didn't agree with me, of course," [MASK] said with a bitter laugh. "She was always so...righteous. Thought she knew what was best for everyone." "What do you mean?"
DarkCorners	50	21052	21017	21067	Dana	"I don't know. She just had this way of talking down to people, like she was better than them. It got on my nerves, to be honest." [MASK] made another note in her book. "And did your conversation turn heated?
DarkCorners	54	21069	21060	21114	Eichmann	"And did your conversation turn heated?" [MASK] hesitated again before nodding. "Yeah, I guess you could say that. We raised our voices a bit. But it wasn't anything serious—just a disagreement." "Then why did you send her the photograph?"
DarkCorners	49	21115	21115	21164	Sam	[MASK] asked. "It was supposed to be a peace offering, you know? A way to smooth things over. I would have delivered it in person, but I was in a rush, so I left it in a box on the front step.
DarkCorners	50	21179	21131	21181	Dana	A way to smooth things over. I would have delivered it in person, but I was in a rush, so I left it in a box on the front step." "And did you ever see her again after the debate?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	56	21182	21182	21238	Eichmann	[MASK] shook his head. "Nope. That was the last time we spoke." He leaned forward, his eyes intent. "I know she was murdered, and I'm guessing from what you said about a 'double homicide' that you're here because there was a second murder.
DarkCorners	49	21250	21250	21299	Eichmann	[MASK], however, seemed to take their silence as confirmation. He leaned back, rubbing his chin nervously. "I didn't kill her," he said in a flat voice. "Where were you that day, since you bring it up?"
DarkCorners	48	21300	21262	21310	Sam	He leaned back, rubbing his chin nervously. "I didn't kill her," he said in a flat voice. "Where were you that day, since you bring it up?" [MASK] asked. "Last Wednesday morning, I mean.
DarkCorners	48	21362	21316	21364	Dana	I was at home," he said, his voice wavering slightly. "I had a deadline for a project I was working on, so I didn't leave the house all day." "What were you working on?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	49	21568	21553	21602	Eichmann	"Ever meet her, talk with her face-to-face?" [MASK] shook his head. "I don't even recognize the name, but I believe you if you say it. That's the nature of social media, isn't it?
DarkCorners	47	21738	21737	21784	Eichmann	" [MASK] shifted uncomfortably, his gaze flicking down to his shoes as if contemplating whether or not to divulge such personal information. Finally, he let out a sigh and spoke. "I...I've always had a fear of open spaces and crowds.
DarkCorners	56	21844	21794	21850	Dana	Recently, though, my mother passed away, and with the onset of depression..." He shook his head and closed his eyes tight. "The point is, I'm doing my best to manage it. But it's a work in progress." [MASK] nodded, studying him closely.
DarkCorners	41	21886	21871	21912	Eichmann	"I think we're done here. Thank you for your time." [MASK] nodded, looking relieved. "Sure. And...I hope you catch whoever did this," he added, his voice softening.
DarkCorners	50	22096	22088	22138	Sam	" "Unfortunately, I agree," [MASK] said, his eyes cutting up the street, which was growing darker by the moment as the sun disappeared behind the trees in a blaze of orange. "I'm beginning to suspect our killer is a chameleon."
DarkCorners	51	22187	22169	22220	Dana	She turned her attention to her own door. Home sweet home, she thought ironically. As [MASK] slipped into the room and closed the door behind her, she breathed a sigh of relief. Her muscles ached, and she felt the fatigue settling deep into her bones.
DarkCorners	54	22252	22206	22260	Dana	Her muscles ached, and she felt the fatigue settling deep into her bones. It had been a long day, and all she wanted was a chance to relax and unwind. After dropping her duffel bag by the foot of the bed, [MASK] took in the hotel room around her.
DarkCorners	50	22356	22327	22377	Dana	Across from the bed, an old television sat atop a wooden dresser, probably filled with pay-per-view movies she wouldn't bother watching. [MASK] walked over to the mini-fridge concealed within the dresser, hoping for a snack or a cold drink.
DarkCorners	41	22504	22495	22536	Dana	As she watched the world outside her window, [MASK] thought about how her father had nurtured her intellect and critical thinking skills during those long hours on the road, instilling in her a deep respect for the U.S. Constitution.
DarkCorners	46	22589	22567	22613	Aurora	Those memories were bittersweet, tainted by the knowledge that her father was gone and that her relationship with her mother, [MASK], remained strained. The two women clashed often, their strong personalities and differing opinions making it difficult to find common ground.
DarkCorners	53	22623	22614	22667	Dana	But even in the face of their disagreements, [MASK] couldn't help yearning for some sort of connection with her mother—especially in moments like this, when she felt so alone and weighed down by the burdens of her job. You're thinking too much, she chided herself.
DarkCorners	50	22706	22692	22742	Dana	As the mellow strains of a Beethoven piano concerto filled the hotel room, [MASK] felt her tense muscles begin to relax. She opened her duffel bag, pulling out a pair of shorts and a soft cotton shirt that would be comfortable enough for a night's sleep.
DarkCorners	49	22797	22770	22819	Dana	The worn edges and creased corners spoke of the countless times she had gone through the pages, revisiting the details of her father's murder. [MASK] hesitated, feeling her heart constrict at the thought of reopening those wounds. Forget about it, she told herself.
DarkCorners	49	22866	22836	22885	Dana	Then, pausing her music, she reached for the remote control on the nightstand. The TV flickered to life, illuminating the room with its artificial glow. [MASK] flipped through the channels, hoping to stumble upon something that could occupy her mind for a while.
DarkCorners	49	22910	22910	22959	Dana	[MASK]'s jaw clenched as she continued to search, stopping briefly at a nature documentary before deciding that images of predators stalking their prey wouldn't help her mood either. A sitcom caught her eye, and she smirked at the absurdity of the characters' antics.
DarkCorners	48	23058	23052	23100	Dana	With the TV now off, [MASK] lay back on the crisp hotel sheets, her mind speeding up despite the exhaustion creeping through her body. She closed her eyes, seeking the solace of sleep, but images of her father's murder haunted her thoughts.
DarkCorners	48	23197	23158	23206	Dana	She reached for it, hoping someone might have messaged her – a friend, or even her mother – but there were no notifications. A pang of loneliness shot through her chest. "Enough," [MASK] whispered to herself, determination creasing her brow.
DarkCorners	50	23283	23274	23324	Dana	As she began to leaf through the file, [MASK]'s fingers hesitated over the sleeve containing the most disturbing photos: images of her father's lifeless body, sprawled across the hotel floor. She'd seen them before, but tonight she decided against pulling them out.
DarkCorners	59	23348	23325	23384	Dana	She didn't need to see his broken form to remember; the pain was etched permanently in her heart. Instead, [MASK] focused on the other crime scene photographs—the angles of the room, the placement of furniture, any overlooked detail that could offer her a shred of insight into her father's killer.
DarkCorners	44	23419	23407	23451	Aurora	That was when she stumbled upon a statement from her mother, [MASK], taken during the initial police investigation. The words on the page seemed distant and detached, a stark contrast to the passion that usually colored her mother's writing.
DarkCorners	44	23667	23661	23705	Dana	Scanning through the recent articles, [MASK] found one penned by her mother. Titled "The Fight for Equality: A Never-Ending Battle," the piece delved into the ongoing struggle for civil rights and the importance of continued activism.
DarkCorners	48	23710	23675	23723	Dana	Titled "The Fight for Equality: A Never-Ending Battle," the piece delved into the ongoing struggle for civil rights and the importance of continued activism. As she read, [MASK] found herself reluctantly admiring her mother's unwavering commitment to social justice.
DarkCorners	50	23736	23724	23774	Aurora	History has shown us that progress is never achieved without resistance, [MASK] wrote. But we cannot afford to grow complacent or discouraged. We must continue to fight for what is right, to ensure that every individual can live a life free from discrimination and oppression.
DarkCorners	46	23775	23739	23785	Dana	But we cannot afford to grow complacent or discouraged. We must continue to fight for what is right, to ensure that every individual can live a life free from discrimination and oppression. [MASK] felt a sudden yearning for her mother's presence.
DarkCorners	51	23892	23848	23899	Dana	The darkness enveloped the room, offering her no solace as she lay back on the pillow, her thoughts still occupied by her father's unsolved murder and the unspoken need for her mother's support. As sleep finally claimed her, [MASK] found herself in a vivid dream.
DarkCorners	56	23993	23941	23997	Dana	Her heartbeat quickened as she approached the hotel's entrance, her eyes darting nervously to every shadow, every passerby—searching for danger, even though she knew it was just a dream. Once inside the hotel, the polished marble floors and ornate chandeliers did little to stifle [MASK]'s growing anxiety.
DarkCorners	48	24054	24032	24080	Dana	The sound of her own voice seemed to echo down the hallway, doing nothing to assuage her fears. Finally, [MASK] arrived at the door of her father's hotel room. Hesitating for a moment, she steeled herself before raising her hand to knock.
DarkCorners	47	24148	24136	24183	Dana	"Please, just let me know you're okay!" [MASK] screamed, beating the door with both fists, the sound of her voice rising, thickening, filling her ears– She woke to the sound of her phone vibrating on the nightstand.
DarkCorners	47	24276	24274	24321	Dana	CHAPTER TEN [MASK] leaned back in her seat, gazing out past the wipers, which were hurrying back and forth in a feeble attempt to divert the cascade of rain running down the windshield, at the place where another innocent woman had breathed her last.
DarkCorners	52	24354	24322	24374	Dana	The area was cordoned off by yellow caution tape, the blue and red lights of the cruisers casting strange shadows on the abandoned stage and the rows of empty chairs. [MASK] could see forensic technicians in white coveralls working diligently, combing through the scene for any trace of evidence.
DarkCorners	48	24393	24375	24423	Dana	In the distance, a small group of detectives huddled under umbrellas, speaking in hushed tones. [MASK] felt a wave of nausea wash over her. The dream about her father's murder still clung to her like a cobweb, making it hard to breathe.
DarkCorners	51	24442	24403	24454	Sam	The dream about her father's murder still clung to her like a cobweb, making it hard to breathe. And now, another life had been stolen, another family shattered. She suddenly became aware that [MASK], sitting in the passenger seat, was staring at her.
DarkCorners	44	24508	24495	24539	Sam	"Just tired and under-caffeinated," she lied, hoping [MASK] would buy it. She didn't want to talk about her dream, not now. He would express understanding, yes; he would be empathetic and attentive.
DarkCorners	46	24569	24540	24586	Sam	But he couldn't really understand what she was going through, couldn't really share the burden. It was easier to just not talk about it. [MASK] didn't seem entirely convinced by her explanation, but he chose not to press further.
DarkCorners	45	24589	24587	24632	Dana	Just as [MASK] was about to open her door, a sudden knock on the window startled her. She quickly rolled it down, coming face-to-face with an officer whose dark hair was plastered to her forehead from the rain.
DarkCorners	44	24715	24691	24735	Dana	"Sorry for startling you. Just thought you might want these." She held up a pair of yellow rain slickers. [MASK] smiled gratefully—she had a waterproof jacket, but it wasn't nearly as protective as a slicker.
DarkCorners	45	24894	24862	24907	Dana	"Well, yesterday afternoon, I suppose—it's past midnight now. Anyway, shortly after she finished, she suddenly collapsed." "This afternoon?" [MASK] asked, surprised. "Why weren't we called in sooner?
DarkCorners	43	24969	24934	24977	Sam	"She had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It's a heart condition that can cause sudden death, especially during physical exertion." "And how did you determine foul play was involved?" [MASK] asked, his brow furrowing in concern.
DarkCorners	52	25234	25220	25272	Dana	"He'd at least attempt to hide it." Just then, [MASK] spotted a small piece of parchment, tucked inside a plastic bag and wedged between the roots of a nearby tree. She probably wouldn't have noticed it if she hadn't been looking for it.
DarkCorners	58	25299	25257	25315	Sam	She probably wouldn't have noticed it if she hadn't been looking for it. Donning a pair of latex gloves, she reached in and pulled the bag free, revealing a series of letters scribbled across it. "[MASK], I've found another code," she said, holding up the bag.
DarkCorners	48	25375	25354	25402	Sam	It had to be another quote from the First Amendment. Perhaps– "'Make no law,'" [MASK] said suddenly, his eyes lighting up with recognition. "That's what it says—'make no law.' Another line from the First Amendment.
DarkCorners	42	25404	25386	25428	Dana	"That's what it says—'make no law.' Another line from the First Amendment." [MASK] studied the parchment as she tried to discern the killer's motives. "Three victims, three quotes from the First Amendment.
DarkCorners	54	25437	25418	25472	Dana	"Three victims, three quotes from the First Amendment. But what does it all mean?" [MASK] couldn't shake the feeling that there was a deeper meaning behind the killer's choice of words, a connection she was missing. What was he trying to say with these quotes?
DarkCorners	50	25586	25579	25629	Sam	" "Worth a shot," [MASK] said, and together they crossed the street. They knocked on the heavy wooden door, which creaked open to reveal a middle-aged woman with short, curly brown hair and glasses perched on the edge of her nose.
DarkCorners	49	25665	25653	25702	Dana	"Hello, ma'am. We're with the FBI," [MASK] said, showing her badge. "We were wondering if the gentleman upstairs watched the rally earlier today. He might have seen something important." The caretaker hesitated, worry creasing her forehead.
DarkCorners	51	25915	25903	25954	Dana	It's been quite an adjustment, but we manage." [MASK] glanced at her, noting the slight slump in the caretaker's shoulders and the tired lines around her eyes. "It must be incredibly hard work," she said, genuine admiration in her voice.
DarkCorners	51	26132	26105	26156	Esmerelda	He had a thin, white beard that accentuated his high cheekbones, and his hands rested on a knitted blanket draped across his lap. "[MASK]," he said, "wheel me inside, would you? This cold is going to be the death of me.
DarkCorners	41	26158	26146	26187	Esmerelda	This cold is going to be the death of me." [MASK] did so. Then she shut the balcony doors and retreated to the far side of the room, folding laundry while keeping an eye on the agents.
DarkCorners	50	26226	26226	26276	Dana	[MASK] asked, getting straight to the point. "Watched the whole thing, yes. Not as good as being there in person, but it's all I can do these days. Beats watching the boob-tube until my brains ooze out my ears."
DarkCorners	58	26291	26291	26349	Dana	[MASK] asked. "I saw her collapse, if that's what you mean. Called an ambulance, too, though I can't guarantee I was the first one to do so. I may be old, but I'm not blind," he said, a hint of humor in his voice.
DarkCorners	57	26362	26307	26364	Sam	Called an ambulance, too, though I can't guarantee I was the first one to do so. I may be old, but I'm not blind," he said, a hint of humor in his voice. "Did you see anyone approach her shortly before that?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	49	26450	26405	26454	Dana	"Not that I recall, no. But I was a little distracted, to be fair—I was watching the man on the other side of the street." "The man on the other side of the street?" [MASK] repeated, intrigued.
DarkCorners	50	26576	26542	26592	Dana	Couldn't see his face too well because of the sunglasses and hoodie, but I remember he had a tattoo on his right hand. Looked like a snake, maybe?" [MASK] scribbled down the details in her notebook. "Have you ever seen him before?
DarkCorners	46	26639	26625	26671	Krenshaw	"There's a man who lives just down the street from here—[MASK], I think his name is. I've bumped into him a few times when I'm out running errands. He works night shifts at the local paper mill.
DarkCorners	48	26692	26681	26729	Esmerelda	"It's called the South Landry Paper Mill." [MASK] nodded. "Yes, that's right." She paused, looking like she had more to say but wasn't sure if she wanted to share it. "What is it?"
DarkCorners	57	26733	26733	26790	Esmerelda	[MASK] pursed her lips. "He's…he can be a real creep, you know? There was another rally here a while back, and as I was on my way back from the laundromat, I saw him standing at the back of the crowd, making these gestures at the woman talking.
DarkCorners	58	27005	27005	27063	Dana	[MASK] spotted a man working alone near one of the large rollers, his back to her. His sleeves were rolled up, his bare arms smudged with some kind of grease. He seemed to be adjusting some dials on the machine, fine-tuning the pressure on the paper that fed through the rollers.
DarkCorners	48	27064	27039	27087	Dana	He seemed to be adjusting some dials on the machine, fine-tuning the pressure on the paper that fed through the rollers. [MASK] approached the man, raising her voice to be heard above the roaring machinery. "Excuse me!" she shouted.
DarkCorners	49	27096	27085	27134	Krenshaw	she shouted. "I'm looking for a man named [MASK]!" The man turned around, clearly startled by her sudden appearance. He raised an eyebrow, unable to hear her properly. "What?" he asked, straining to catch her words.
DarkCorners	51	27140	27099	27150	Krenshaw	The man turned around, clearly startled by her sudden appearance. He raised an eyebrow, unable to hear her properly. "What?" he asked, straining to catch her words. "I'm looking for [MASK]!" she said. "Is he here?
DarkCorners	48	27177	27166	27214	Krenshaw	He seemed to be amused by something. "Yeah, [MASK]'s here," he said, raising his voice to be heard over the cacophony of machinery. "You'll find him on the other side of the mill, working the drying rollers.
DarkCorners	51	27220	27215	27266	Dana	" "Thanks," [MASK] replied, her gaze lingering on his greasy arms for a moment before she turned and headed toward the other side of the mill. As she walked, however, she began to feel a nagging suspicion gnawing at the back of her mind.
DarkCorners	49	27368	27368	27417	Dana	[MASK] spun around, ready to confront the man again, but he was gone. In the distance, she caught a glimpse of him disappearing through a doorway leading into another part of the mill. The door swung shut behind him, cutting off her view.
DarkCorners	53	27418	27384	27437	Dana	In the distance, she caught a glimpse of him disappearing through a doorway leading into another part of the mill. The door swung shut behind him, cutting off her view. [MASK]'s surroundings blurred as she sprinted after the man, her focus solely on the rapidly closing door.
DarkCorners	56	27449	27438	27494	Krenshaw	The cacophony of machinery and paper processing drowned out any sound [MASK] might make. Overhead pipes groaned as they pumped water into the enormous vats that turned raw pulp into usable paper. The floor was slick with a mixture of water and wood fibers that made traction difficult and threatened to send her sprawling.
DarkCorners	51	27496	27472	27523	Dana	The floor was slick with a mixture of water and wood fibers that made traction difficult and threatened to send her sprawling. As [MASK] raced toward the doorway, she spotted a narrow passage between two stacks of massive paper rolls at the mouth of a dark, cavernous room.
DarkCorners	52	27606	27600	27652	Dana	Emerging from the claustrophobic passage, [MASK] found herself in a dimly lit room. Shadows danced on the walls, cast by the flickering bulbs overhead. Pallets were stacked haphazardly around the room, waiting to be loaded with reams of finished paper and whisked away to their final destinations.
DarkCorners	53	27679	27628	27681	Krenshaw	Pallets were stacked haphazardly around the room, waiting to be loaded with reams of finished paper and whisked away to their final destinations. Despite the chaos of the paper mill outside, this room felt eerily still, almost as if time had slowed to a crawl. "[MASK]!"
DarkCorners	55	27766	27753	27808	Dana	"Don't make this harder than it has to be." [MASK]'s eyes narrowed as she focused on the small gap between a stack of pallets and the factory wall. It was an ideal hiding spot—just enough room for a person to squeeze in and remain concealed from view.
DarkCorners	46	27955	27931	27977	Dana	Then, a sudden noise behind her snapped her back to full alertness—the sound of footsteps rapidly approaching. Whirling around, [MASK] barely had time to register the figure charging toward her before he slammed into her, knocking her off her feet.
DarkCorners	52	28341	28312	28364	Sam	How had he known they wanted to speak to him about a murder, since they hadn't mentioned anything about it? "Look at him," [MASK] said, joining her by the mirror. "Just sitting there like he's waiting for a bus or something."
DarkCorners	58	28478	28458	28516	Dana	Then, with a deep breath, she opened the door and stepped out into the police precinct hallway. [MASK] found herself enveloped in a heavy silence that permeated the air. The atmosphere was stagnant, weighed down by the lateness of the night and the exhaustion of the officers who still lingered about their duties.
DarkCorners	51	28644	28630	28681	Dana	he asked nonchalantly, as if this were all just a minor inconvenience. [MASK] raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "We haven't even talked with you yet." He shrugged, leaning back in his chair. "I'm innocent, so what does it matter?
DarkCorners	50	28844	28844	28894	Krenshaw	[MASK] hesitated for a moment before grabbing a tissue from the box on the table. He scrubbed at the grease coating his arms, revealing the snake tattoo beneath. Its body coiled around his forearm, its head poised as if ready to strike, fangs bared menacingly.
DarkCorners	46	28900	28860	28906	Dana	He scrubbed at the grease coating his arms, revealing the snake tattoo beneath. Its body coiled around his forearm, its head poised as if ready to strike, fangs bared menacingly. "Interesting choice," [MASK] said, studying the tattoo.
DarkCorners	45	28981	28960	29005	Krenshaw	" "Power should belong to the people, not to those who claim they're better than us," [MASK] said, his eyes glowing with passion. "Too many politicians ignore the needs of their constituents while lining their own pockets.
DarkCorners	49	29129	29125	29174	Sam	"Look," [MASK] said with a tired sigh. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way. But trust me, it's in your best interest to cooperate and tell us what you know." "Oh, yeah?"
DarkCorners	53	29175	29136	29189	Krenshaw	"We can do this the easy way or the hard way. But trust me, it's in your best interest to cooperate and tell us what you know." "Oh, yeah?" [MASK] asked with a flicker of defiance. "What's the hard way?
DarkCorners	53	29238	29223	29276	Krenshaw	We're here to get to the truth, not to harm you." [MASK] snorted. "The truth? You think you can handle the truth? You're just glorified interrogators, trying to get a confession out of me because you've got nothing else to go on.
DarkCorners	50	29278	29241	29291	Dana	"The truth? You think you can handle the truth? You're just glorified interrogators, trying to get a confession out of me because you've got nothing else to go on." [MASK] leaned back in her chair, her arms crossed over her chest.
DarkCorners	50	29410	29409	29459	Krenshaw	" [MASK] hesitated a moment longer, looking like he might lie just to spite them. Then, relaxing, he sighed and looked down at the table. "Fine. Yes, I was at the rally." "And what were you doing there?"
DarkCorners	54	29530	29511	29565	Dana	"No. I changed my mind and left before I could even get close to her." [MASK] studied his face, trying to determine if he was telling the truth or not. There was something about his demeanor that suggested he might be hiding more than he was letting on.
DarkCorners	50	29654	29619	29669	Krenshaw	"If you're innocent, then you have nothing to hide. Tell us why you wanted to speak with her." "We dated a few months ago, okay?" [MASK] said, bitterness creeping into his voice. "It didn't end well.
DarkCorners	52	29829	29821	29873	Krenshaw	"No, of course not!" [MASK] exclaimed, his voice rising. "I would never do something like that. She was just trying to save face, to come up with a good excuse to break up with me because she couldn't handle having a relationship.
DarkCorners	51	29908	29883	29934	Sam	He shook his head, clearly still bitter about it. "I would've thought you two would have that in common," [MASK] said. "That's what I thought at first, too. But she was as by-the-book as they come.
DarkCorners	46	29955	29911	29957	Dana	"That's what I thought at first, too. But she was as by-the-book as they come. I'm more of a free thinker." "Is that why you went to the rally?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	47	30100	30075	30122	Krenshaw	"I think you jabbed her with a needle and poisoned her. A perfect way to get your revenge without anyone noticing." [MASK]'s face flushed with anger, and his fists clenching on the table. "I would never kill her!"
DarkCorners	51	30145	30123	30174	Dana	he shouted, his voice cracking with emotion. "I was hurt, but I wouldn't do that!" [MASK] regarded him closely, searching for any sign of deception in his words or body language. His reaction seemed genuine, but she needed more information nonetheless.
DarkCorners	47	30219	30182	30229	Krenshaw	"Let's assume you're telling the truth. There's still the matter of you running from us when we confronted you at the paper mill. Care to explain that to us?" [MASK] slumped back in his chair, his shoulders sagging.
DarkCorners	43	30292	30262	30305	Dana	I don't have an alibi to prove I didn't kill her, and I didn't want to get framed for something I didn't do." [MASK] scrutinized his reaction, searching for any sign that he was lying.
DarkCorners	42	30338	30306	30348	Petra	But his calm demeanor and unwavering confidence seemed genuine, and she found herself believing him. Still, he had – by his own admission – been at the rally where [MASK] was killed. How could she rule him out?
DarkCorners	42	30403	30403	30445	Krenshaw	[MASK]'s eyes were vague for a moment. "I was at home, sleeping. I work the night shift at the mill, so I usually sleep during the day." "Can anyone else confirm that?"
DarkCorners	51	30449	30449	30500	Krenshaw	[MASK] nodded. "Yeah, my neighbor saw me coming home just before seven a.m. He usually sits outside drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette, so he saw me pull up in my car. He can tell you I didn't go anywhere until the afternoon, too.
DarkCorners	50	30513	30465	30515	Dana	He usually sits outside drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette, so he saw me pull up in my car. He can tell you I didn't go anywhere until the afternoon, too." "What about last Wednesday, around nine a.m.?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	50	30528	30516	30566	Krenshaw	"I was out with some coworkers from the mill," [MASK] replied, gaining confidence now. "We were grabbing breakfast at a diner close to the plant. I sat with my supervisor and another coworker, and we talked about some work-related stuff.
DarkCorners	49	30574	30535	30584	Dana	"We were grabbing breakfast at a diner close to the plant. I sat with my supervisor and another coworker, and we talked about some work-related stuff. They'll vouch for me." [MASK] sat back in her chair, deep in thought.
DarkCorners	54	30720	30667	30721	Petra	"He's got alibis for two of the three murders, and I really don't think we're dealing with multiple killers here. We can keep him on ice for now, but unless we discover a syringe with his fingerprints on it, I don't think he killed [MASK].
DarkCorners	49	30792	30790	30839	Dana	CHAPTER THIRTEEN [MASK]'s heart was heavy as she watched the woman usher two sleepy-looking kids into a minivan while a man – her husband, presumably – looked on from the open garage, the leash of a medium-sized dog wrapped around one hand.
DarkCorners	43	31108	31081	31124	Rafael	We'd like to speak with you about her, if that's all right. May we come inside?" "Of course," [MASK] said, motioning for them to follow him through the garage and into the house.
DarkCorners	45	31132	31125	31170	Dana	As they passed through the garage, [MASK] couldn't help but notice how it seemed to tell the story of a loving family. Tools were neatly organized on pegboards along the walls, and several bikes of varying sizes stood in a row.
DarkCorners	52	31194	31150	31202	Petra	Tools were neatly organized on pegboards along the walls, and several bikes of varying sizes stood in a row. She spotted a half-finished birdhouse on a workbench, surrounded by wood shavings and paint cans, clearly a project that [MASK]'s younger siblings had been working on.
DarkCorners	47	31618	31580	31627	Sam	" His voice was filled with pride, but also tinged with sorrow. "We never expected that her dedication to free speech and standing up for what's right would put her in danger." [MASK] leaned forward, elbows resting on his knees.
DarkCorners	47	31737	31710	31757	Petra	"That man...he was bad news from the start. Their relationship was toxic, and we could see the toll it was taking on [MASK]. He was possessive, paranoid, and he had a volatile temper." "How so?"
DarkCorners	54	32007	32006	32060	Petra	"[MASK] always believed that everyone should have the right to express their opinions, no matter how unpopular or controversial they might be." He let out a heavy sigh. "We encouraged her to stand up for what she believed in, to use her voice to make a difference.
DarkCorners	50	32076	32039	32089	Rafael	"We encouraged her to stand up for what she believed in, to use her voice to make a difference. She took that to heart, and it became her life's mission." [MASK] checked the time on his watch and sighed, his shoulders slumping.
DarkCorners	47	32180	32156	32203	Rafael	Thank you for your time and cooperation. If we have any further questions or information, we'll be in touch." [MASK] nodded, his eyes glassy as he prepared himself for the difficult task ahead. "Thank you," he said.
DarkCorners	49	32330	32314	32363	Sam	What about the toxicology report on the poison? Any word from the lab?" [MASK] pulled out his phone and shook his head. "Haven't heard anything yet." As they climbed into the SUV, the darkness of the car interior felt suffocating.
DarkCorners	47	32364	32347	32394	Dana	" As they climbed into the SUV, the darkness of the car interior felt suffocating. [MASK]'s mind raced with unanswered questions and leads that seemed to go nowhere. Just as she turned the key in the ignition, however, her phone rang.
DarkCorners	47	32506	32477	32524	Michaels	"Wait...why? What's going on?" "We might've just gotten a big break, that's what's going on," [MASK] said. "The killer sent us a message." CHAPTER FOURTEEN "He's taunting us
DarkCorners	48	32527	32509	32557	Sam	"The killer sent us a message." CHAPTER FOURTEEN "He's taunting us," [MASK] muttered, his jaw set in a tight line as he stared at the handwritten message they'd been shown upon arriving at the Liberty Bell Tribune's headquarters.
DarkCorners	47	32568	32567	32614	Dana	" [MASK] studied the message under the harsh fluorescent lights of the conference room. The killer's handwriting was awkward and stilted, as if he had worked very hard to make it legible. The note read: I like you serve a higher power.
DarkCorners	49	32635	32603	32652	Dana	The note read: I like you serve a higher power. My mission is divine my plans unstoppable. Get in my way, and you will only be crushed. [MASK] leaned back, thinking about the message and the killer's decision to send it here.
DarkCorners	54	32715	32678	32732	Dana	Known for its investigative journalism and political commentary, it made sense that the killer would choose this publication as a platform to communicate with law enforcement. The conference room buzzed with a tense energy as [MASK] scanned the faces of the task force members, each one present for their unique expertise.
DarkCorners	44	32902	32896	32940	Leslie	"It was our secretary, [MASK]. She's just a temp, really, but she's the one who came across it first thing this morning. I don't think she realized the gravity of what she'd found."
DarkCorners	54	32949	32904	32958	Leslie	She's just a temp, really, but she's the one who came across it first thing this morning. I don't think she realized the gravity of what she'd found." His tone suggested that he didn't consider [MASK] particularly significant in the grand scheme of things.
DarkCorners	53	33262	33240	33293	Sam	It was just lying there, right next to my computer." "What time did you come in?" [MASK] asked. "Six o'clock. I was the first one here." She colored a little. "Have to get the coffee started early, you know.
DarkCorners	51	33295	33265	33316	Dana	"Six o'clock. I was the first one here." She colored a little. "Have to get the coffee started early, you know." [MASK] felt a stirring of sympathy for this young woman who had unknowingly stumbled into the middle of a murder investigation.
DarkCorners	51	33397	33385	33436	Leslie	"And did you notice anything else unusual this morning?" [MASK] furrowed her brow, thinking. "Not really. It was pretty quiet, just like any other morning. Although..." She hesitated, as if unsure whether to continue. "Although what?"
DarkCorners	53	33464	33457	33510	Leslie	"Don't be cryptic." [MASK] bit her lip nervously. "Well, I did notice that the front door was unlocked when I came in. That's never happened before. I thought maybe one of the delivery people forgot to lock up after dropping off the papers.
DarkCorners	53	33512	33493	33546	Dana	I thought maybe one of the delivery people forgot to lock up after dropping off the papers." [MASK] frowned. "Did you see anyone around?" "No, but I didn't really look either. I just assumed it was a mistake and locked the door myself.
DarkCorners	43	33619	33599	33642	Frank	"Have you had any break-ins before?" she asked. "Break-ins?" [MASK] frowned. "No, not that I recall." "What about any disgruntled employees you might've fired?"
DarkCorners	50	33775	33768	33818	Frank	Thank you for your help." [MASK] lingered a few seconds longer. It was clear he didn't like being dismissed. He couldn't very well demand to be part of an ongoing federal investigation, however. He ducked his head. "Of course."
DarkCorners	48	33826	33782	33830	Dana	It was clear he didn't like being dismissed. He couldn't very well demand to be part of an ongoing federal investigation, however. He ducked his head. "Of course." As he retreated to the door, [MASK] called to him.
DarkCorners	51	33916	33871	33922	Sam	" "Of course," he said again with a greasy smile. "There won't be a peep, not from anyone here." With that, he slipped out and closed the door behind him. "Alright," [MASK] said, clearing his throat.
DarkCorners	41	34040	34001	34042	Sam	" He leaned forward. "We know he's bold enough to break into a newspaper office and leave a letter behind. What if we use that to our advantage?" "How so?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	52	34123	34101	34153	Sam	"How so? If it doesn't work out, what's the harm?" "The harm," [MASK] said, "is that we've raised awareness about this creep, which is exactly what he wants: to put himself in the public's eye."
DarkCorners	51	34154	34154	34205	Sam	[MASK] shook his head and leaned back. "No, we can't just give him what he wants. It'll only make him bolder." "Maybe he's part of some underground hate group," suggested a young officer from the corner of the room.
DarkCorners	51	34248	34206	34257	Sam	"We should look into known extremist organizations." "Or it could be more than one person working together," another chimed in. "This kind of operation might require a team." "Enough," [MASK] said, his voice cutting through the speculation.
DarkCorners	46	34301	34258	34304	Sam	"Let's not jump to conclusions without any evidence. Our killer has been precise and calculated so far; we have no reason to believe there's a whole group behind this." The room fell silent as they considered [MASK]'s words.
DarkCorners	53	34368	34363	34416	Dana	" All eyes shifted toward [MASK], waiting for her insight. She looked up from the letter, feeling the weight of their expectations. Taking a deep breath, she spoke slowly and deliberately. "The messages we've received so far have all focused exclusively on the First Amendment.
DarkCorners	45	34570	34545	34590	Fall	"And how do you know him?" "Attended a few lectures he gave on the Constitution for law enforcement officers," [MASK] explained. "The man knows his stuff, and he's got a way of making it relatable.
DarkCorners	42	34610	34573	34615	Dana	"The man knows his stuff, and he's got a way of making it relatable. I think he could help us understand what we're dealing with here." "Alright," [MASK] said, taking charge.
DarkCorners	45	34665	34646	34691	Dana	"What do we do, sit on our hands?" "That's one option," [MASK] said mildly. "Or you can get busy. Check the lock and see how the killer got in—did he pick it?
DarkCorners	54	36282	36252	36306	Dana	It was as if he were invisible, free to move about unnoticed, undetected. And best of all, free to strike again. CHAPTER SIXTEEN Meanwhile, [MASK] drove down the busy Philadelphia streets, her eyes scanning the road ahead while her mind churned with the details of the case.
DarkCorners	55	36345	36345	36400	Dana	[MASK], piloting the unmarked SUV down the busy Philadelphia streets, glanced over at him, eyebrows raised in curiosity. "What are you talking about?" "Someone leaked details about the letter left at the Liberty Bell Tribune," he said, scrolling through the article on his screen.
DarkCorners	44	36420	36414	36458	Dana	" "Damn it," [MASK] muttered under her breath, gripping the steering wheel a little tighter. This was exactly what she'd intended to avoid. She didn't want the killer to play on the fears of the public.
DarkCorners	54	36518	36496	36550	Sam	Sometimes, these killers became as popular as Hollywood celebrities. "Media's always looking for a catchy name," [MASK] said, his voice tinged with disdain. "It doesn't matter how many lives are at stake or how much harder they make our jobs by sensationalizing the crimes.
DarkCorners	51	36611	36605	36656	Sam	"Listen to this," [MASK] went on, shaking his head in disbelief. "'Beware, citizens, the Constitution Killer is lurking in the shadows, ready to strike at any moment. Be vigilant, be prepared, and most importantly, be afraid.'
DarkCorners	53	36664	36621	36674	Dana	"'Beware, citizens, the Constitution Killer is lurking in the shadows, ready to strike at any moment. Be vigilant, be prepared, and most importantly, be afraid.'" "That's awful," [MASK] said, disgusted by the blatant fear-mongering.
DarkCorners	50	36726	36684	36734	Sam	I wanted to control the narrative about the case, not let it spiral out of control like this." "Unfortunately, once the media gets their hands on something, there's not much we can do," [MASK] said, his tone sympathetic yet resigned.
DarkCorners	46	36787	36743	36789	Sam	"I just worry about what could happen now. It might make it even more difficult for us to catch the killer. And what if it inspires copycat killers?" "Guess it's out of our hands now," [MASK] said.
DarkCorners	51	36883	36852	36903	Dana	They passed a football field where a group of high school students were practicing. The sound of their cheers and the thud of their bodies colliding filled the air. [MASK] felt a pang of sadness as she watched them, wondering if they knew how fragile life really was.
DarkCorners	50	36941	36914	36964	Dana	"I never asked you, did you ever play any sports growing up?" he asked. "Uh, yeah, actually," [MASK] replied, slightly surprised by the sudden shift in conversation. "I played soccer and ran track in high school."
DarkCorners	50	36999	36953	37003	Sam	"I played soccer and ran track in high school." A small smile formed on her face as memories of her athletic days returned to her. "Why do you ask?" "Really? You must have been fast," [MASK] said, chuckling.
DarkCorners	51	37024	37010	37061	Dana	It wasn't the best, but I enjoyed it." Absently, [MASK] tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. "Quarterback?" He shook his head. "Cornerback. I was too small to play quarterback, but I had a mean tackle."
DarkCorners	49	37081	37034	37083	Dana	"Quarterback?" He shook his head. "Cornerback. I was too small to play quarterback, but I had a mean tackle." He laughed. "I miss those days sometimes, you know? Things were simpler then." [MASK] nodded.
DarkCorners	47	37145	37105	37152	Sam	"I hear you," she said, her voice wistful. "Sometimes I wish I could go back to being that carefree teenager again." "But then we wouldn't be doing this," [MASK] said, gesturing to their surroundings.
DarkCorners	48	37190	37185	37233	Sam	There was something alluring about [MASK]. His sense of humor, his caring nature, and his unwavering support throughout their partnership had forged a strong bond between them—and in moments like these it felt like it might develop into something more than just friendship.
DarkCorners	53	37234	37192	37245	Sam	His sense of humor, his caring nature, and his unwavering support throughout their partnership had forged a strong bond between them—and in moments like these it felt like it might develop into something more than just friendship. [MASK] broke the stare, instead gazing ahead through the windshield.
DarkCorners	44	37267	37246	37290	Dana	"Looks like we're here," he said, pointing. "Don't miss your turn." [MASK], her face feeling a bit warm, moved into the left lane and turned at the light, entering the campus.
DarkCorners	52	37428	37421	37473	Sam	"Couldn't be more different, [MASK]. I practically lived in the library, poring over law books and political theories. I didn't have much time for parties." "Ah, so you were one of those students," he teased, nudging her playfully.
DarkCorners	50	37499	37474	37524	Sam	"But hey, look where that dedication got you. You're one of the best agents out there." "Thanks, [MASK]. And your social skills have certainly come in handy on the job as well." He waved a dismissive hand at her.
DarkCorners	51	37631	37626	37677	Dana	"Excuse me," [MASK] said as she approached a young woman sitting on a nearby bench, the woman's fingers tapping away at her laptop. The student looked up, her dark hair tied in a messy bun and thick-rimmed glasses perched on her nose.
DarkCorners	41	37692	37692	37733	Dana	[MASK] asked. "Sure," the student replied, pausing her typing to give them directions. "Take the stairs to the second floor, turn left, and it'll be the third classroom on your right.
DarkCorners	53	37941	37929	37982	Dana	"The class should end soon." As they waited, [MASK] observed the professor's teaching style. It was clear he had an infectious passion for the subject, his enthusiasm spreading through the room like wildfire. She hoped this energy would translate into helpful insights for their case.
DarkCorners	47	37985	37949	37996	Dana	It was clear he had an infectious passion for the subject, his enthusiasm spreading through the room like wildfire. She hoped this energy would translate into helpful insights for their case. Just as [MASK] had predicted, the class ended a few minutes later.
DarkCorners	46	38336	38329	38375	Abrams	" "Is that so?" [MASK] rubbed his chin thoughtfully, the corners of his mouth tugging upwards. "Well, I must admit, constitutional murder mysteries are not exactly within my purview, but I do enjoy a good intellectual puzzle.
DarkCorners	47	38390	38350	38397	Dana	"Well, I must admit, constitutional murder mysteries are not exactly within my purview, but I do enjoy a good intellectual puzzle." "Then perhaps you can help us make sense of this," [MASK] said, pulling out her notepad.
DarkCorners	47	38460	38442	38489	Dana	"At each crime scene, the killer left a scrambled quote from the First Amendment,” [MASK] continued. “Unscrambled, the quotes are 'abridging the freedom of speech,' 'peaceably to assemble,' and 'make no law.'
DarkCorners	45	38495	38463	38508	Abrams	“Unscrambled, the quotes are 'abridging the freedom of speech,' 'peaceably to assemble,' and 'make no law.'" "Curious," [MASK] murmured, his eyes narrowing as he mentally sifted through the information.
DarkCorners	51	38674	38670	38721	Abrams	"Perhaps," [MASK] began, "the killer is making a statement about the erosion of these fundamental rights. The quotes could be his way of highlighting political suppression or the government's intrusion on personal freedoms." He paused, rubbing his chin again before continuing.
DarkCorners	49	38759	38722	38771	Dana	"Or maybe it's more personal than that. The victims were all politically active, after all. The killer might see them as symbolically representing the ideals he believes are being violated." [MASK] nodded, feigning polite interest, but inwardly she was disappointed.
DarkCorners	51	38791	38790	38841	Abrams	Then [MASK]' eyes lit up with a realization. "In fact, this reminds me of something I came across recently." He opened his laptop and typed rapidly, searching for the information he needed. "Ah, here it is," he said triumphantly.
DarkCorners	55	38884	38842	38897	Sam	"There's an online forum called Constitution Crusaders where people discuss their radical interpretations of the Constitution. Some of these individuals have very extremist views, often promoting violent action against the government." "Violent action?" [MASK] asked, leaning in to get a closer look at the screen.
DarkCorners	51	38902	38898	38949	Abrams	"Indeed," [MASK] replied, turning the laptop around so they could view the headlines of the forum posts. "For example, this thread discusses the need to overthrow the government by any means necessary, even suggesting that bloodshed is required to ignite a new revolution.
DarkCorners	50	38951	38920	38970	Dana	"For example, this thread discusses the need to overthrow the government by any means necessary, even suggesting that bloodshed is required to ignite a new revolution." [MASK]'s eyes narrowed as she scanned through the various posts, taking in the intensity of their rhetoric.
DarkCorners	58	39018	38971	39029	Dana	She noticed one post that detailed how certain politicians should be "silenced" for their infringement upon free speech. Another argued that peaceful assembly was no longer enough to effect change, and that forceful action was the only solution. Could the killer, [MASK] wondered, be one of these "Constitutional Crusaders"?
DarkCorners	47	39122	39089	39136	Dana	One post featured a crudely drawn caricature of a politician with a dagger plunged into his heart, captioned with the chilling words: "The only way to be heard." [MASK] felt a surge of intrigue as she cautiously delved deeper into his profile.
DarkCorners	45	39259	39243	39288	Dana	" He sighed and scooted closer, rubbing tired eyes before focusing on the screen. [MASK] pointed at the man's profile. "See how he's posing with firearms in almost every picture? And these aggressive captions...it's unsettling.
DarkCorners	44	39299	39267	39311	Sam	"See how he's posing with firearms in almost every picture? And these aggressive captions...it's unsettling." "He does look like bad news," [MASK] agreed grudgingly. "What's his connection to the rallies?
DarkCorners	53	39318	39312	39365	Dana	" "Look here," [MASK] said, clicking through the man's photos. "He's been attending a lot of political events, just like our victims. He could be our guy." "Has he been to any of the rallies where the murders took place?
DarkCorners	48	39466	39466	39514	Sam	[MASK] checked his watch and cursed under his breath. "I forgot I was supposed to meet with the chief in ten minutes, give him an update on things." He paused. "Only problem is, we've just got the one vehicle.
DarkCorners	46	39516	39476	39522	Dana	"I forgot I was supposed to meet with the chief in ten minutes, give him an update on things." He paused. "Only problem is, we've just got the one vehicle." [MASK] looked at him, surprised.
DarkCorners	52	39579	39551	39603	Sam	Either that or he feels the need to micromanage us. "Is there a reason I'm not invited to this meeting?" she asked. [MASK] glanced away and bit his lip, looking uncomfortable. "It wasn't my idea." Suddenly, it made sense.
DarkCorners	47	39604	39590	39637	Dana	"It wasn't my idea." Suddenly, it made sense. [MASK] clenched her jaw, frustrated at being deliberately cut out. "What's his problem with me, anyway?" she asked. "Does he feel threatened by me?
DarkCorners	49	39720	39698	39747	Sam	"How generous of him." She reached into her pocket, meaning to dig out the SUV keys, but [MASK] shook his head suddenly. "You know what?" he said. "You might need wheels. I'll just take a cab.
DarkCorners	49	39785	39748	39797	Dana	" "You sure?" He nodded, already moving away. "Touch base after!" With that, he hurried out of the restaurant. Alone now in the nearly empty restaurant, [MASK]'s shoulders slumped and her eyes stared blankly at the table.
DarkCorners	51	39798	39798	39849	Michaels	[MASK], she thought, shaking her head bitterly. It was probably for the best, though. The less she saw of him, the better. What was she supposed to do now, though? Keep looking at that forum, investigating the backgrounds of other users?
DarkCorners	49	40159	40143	40192	Dana	Not at all. What can I do for you?" As they spoke, [MASK] noticed the faint sounds of birds chirping in the background. The melodic songs were light and uplifting, a pleasant contrast to the heavy weight of the case on her mind.
DarkCorners	47	40218	40193	40240	Nolan	Curious, she asked, "What's with the birds?" "Ah, I'm in the mountains right now," [MASK] explained, his voice full of warmth. "Just me and my camera." "Really? Photography?"
DarkCorners	57	40275	40271	40328	Nolan	"Absolutely," [MASK] replied with enthusiasm. "You know, I've always enjoyed exploring the great outdoors, but taking photographs adds a whole new dimension to the experience. It's not just about being active; it's about capturing the beauty of the world around us in a single frame.
DarkCorners	44	40330	40305	40349	Dana	It's not just about being active; it's about capturing the beauty of the world around us in a single frame." [MASK] considered his words for a moment, nodding. "That's a lovely way to put it.
DarkCorners	51	40437	40391	40442	Dana	And don't even get me started on sunsets." He chuckled. "But I also enjoy capturing the subtle details: the patterns on a butterfly's wings or the dewdrops on a spider's web." "Sounds fascinating," [MASK] murmured, genuinely impressed.
DarkCorners	49	40512	40491	40540	Nolan	" She hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath. "I'm working on a case, [MASK]—a serial killer. And I feel like I've hit a dead end." Her voice trembled slightly, betraying her frustration and exhaustion.
DarkCorners	49	40547	40530	40579	Nolan	Her voice trembled slightly, betraying her frustration and exhaustion. "Tell me more," [MASK] said, his tone shifting to one of concern. "Well, he's taken three lives so far, all of the victims young women who are political activists.
DarkCorners	45	40652	40621	40666	Nolan	She paused. "And, if that's not enough, he just left a message at a local newspaper, taunting us." "Very interesting," [MASK] murmured. "What did it say?" "Nothing of substance.
DarkCorners	51	40704	40655	40706	Dana	"What did it say?" "Nothing of substance. Just that we would never catch him, that he was the real supporter of the Constitution—that kind of thing." "Any theories so far on why he's doing this?" [MASK] sighed.
DarkCorners	55	40777	40761	40816	Nolan	" "I wonder why the killer is so focused on the First Amendment," [MASK] mused. "If his goal is to draw attention to the Constitution – to show how he's a true supporter of the Constitution, that is – then why limit himself to one of the Amendments?
DarkCorners	48	40832	40817	40865	Dana	His quotes should be all over the place, don't you think?" [MASK]'s eyebrows pulled together in a frown. "I hadn't really thought about that." She sighed. "Honestly, there's probably a lot I'm missing.
DarkCorners	50	41007	40991	41041	Nolan	"That case nearly drove me insane." "But it didn't," [MASK] said. "You persevered, relentless, piecing together the cryptic poems he left with each victim, refusing to give up. Your intuition and persistence led us straight to him.
DarkCorners	52	41116	41070	41122	Dana	"No, but you were instrumental," he said. "And let's not forget about the other serial killers you've brought to justice since then. My point is that you're more than capable of handling this new case, [MASK]. Don't doubt yourself.
DarkCorners	51	41181	41156	41207	Nolan	She knew he was right; she had faced seemingly insurmountable challenges before, and she would do so again. "Thank you, [MASK]," she said softly, grateful for his unwavering faith in her abilities. "Of course." He paused for a moment.
DarkCorners	42	41300	41268	41310	Nolan	She didn't like knowing she was so close to the Bard. "I'll think about it," she said. There was a beat of silence. Then [MASK] spoke, a note of concern entering his voice.
DarkCorners	52	41312	41311	41363	Dana	"[MASK], I have to ask—are you taking care of yourself? You sound very tired." "I'm fine," she replied a bit too quickly, brushing off his concern. "Just a little worn out from the case, that's all.
DarkCorners	47	41536	41528	41575	Nolan	"I have to run now," [MASK] said apologetically. "Got a photography workshop up here in the mountains I need to attend. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything." "Will do.
DarkCorners	47	41580	41540	41587	Dana	"Got a photography workshop up here in the mountains I need to attend. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything." "Will do. Thanks again," [MASK] said, hanging up the phone.
DarkCorners	46	42021	42009	42055	Dana	"Is it really necessary to have so many guards?" [MASK] asked, brushing a strand of brown hair out of her face. One of the guards, a man in his forties with a neatly-trimmed mustache, glanced at her.
DarkCorners	44	42117	42084	42128	Dana	"Just last month, he managed to stab one of our guards with a makeshift shiv he'd fashioned from a toothbrush. The poor guy almost bled to death." [MASK] swallowed hard, wondering what she'd gotten herself into.
DarkCorners	45	42177	42172	42217	Morgan	Within moments they'd reached [MASK]'s cell, a small, barren space with only a narrow cot, a toilet, and a sink to call its own. The air inside was stale, heavy with the scent of confinement and despair.
DarkCorners	43	42395	42384	42427	Morgan	Two of the guards moved into the room first, securing [MASK] to a table in the center with handcuffs and leg restraints. The remaining two positioned themselves strategically around the room, their weapons at the ready should anything go awry.
DarkCorners	56	42640	42586	42642	Morgan	He hadn't changed much since she last saw him—still tall and lean, his dark hair graying at the temples. His eyes seemed to bore into her soul, a hint of a smile playing at the corners of his lips. "Long time, no see," [MASK] said.
DarkCorners	53	42711	42710	42763	Dana	" [MASK] glanced away, hating the feel of his eyes on her. "Why did you taunt the police with those letters?" she asked. "You took a risk, exposing yourself like that. You could still be a free man if you had been more cautious.
DarkCorners	48	42765	42724	42772	Morgan	"Why did you taunt the police with those letters?" she asked. "You took a risk, exposing yourself like that. You could still be a free man if you had been more cautious." [MASK] remained silent, his expression unreadable.
DarkCorners	55	42866	42859	42914	Morgan	She sensed that admitting the truth to [MASK] would give him some power over her, and she couldn't afford to do that—not now, not ever. She also sensed, however, that she wouldn't get anything from him so long as he believed she was lying to him.
DarkCorners	54	42915	42890	42944	Dana	She also sensed, however, that she wouldn't get anything from him so long as he believed she was lying to him. [MASK] swallowed the lump in her throat, hesitating to reveal the true purpose of her visit. She felt cornered, but there was no turning back now.
DarkCorners	41	42952	42933	42974	Morgan	She felt cornered, but there was no turning back now. Taking a deep breath, she looked [MASK] directly in his cold, calculating eyes and said, "I need your help on a case I'm working.
DarkCorners	48	42992	42990	43038	Dana	He studied [MASK] with a predatory intensity, as if he were a wolf examining its prey. The cruel glint in his eyes was unmistakable; he relished her vulnerability, savoring every word she spoke. "Well, well," he drawled, smirking.
DarkCorners	50	43125	43081	43131	Morgan	"The person I'm looking for has been leaving quotes from the First Amendment at crime scenes," she said. "And this morning, he left a note at the headquarters of a newspaper." "Really?" [MASK] asked, raising an eyebrow.
DarkCorners	58	43193	43151	43209	Morgan	"And what did the note say, pray tell?" "The note basically stated that the killer has the 'right' to do whatever he wants, and nobody can stop him." "Ah," [MASK] murmured, tapping his fingers on the table, his restraints clinking with each movement.
DarkCorners	46	43285	43263	43309	Dana	"Don't you have a whole department of FBI agents to help you figure that out?" he asked. [MASK] wasn't going to take any more crap from him. "Do you want to go back to staring at the wall?
DarkCorners	45	43413	43394	43439	Morgan	"You're asking for a personal secret in exchange for professional aid?" "Exactly," [MASK] said, the corner of his mouth quirking up into an infuriating smirk. His eyes roved over her face, watching her reaction closely.
DarkCorners	43	43454	43447	43490	Morgan	Every instinct told her not to trust [MASK], not to give him anything. But she also knew she needed his insight. The weight of the case was pressing heavy on her shoulders, and she was running out of time.
DarkCorners	52	43501	43491	43543	Morgan	Swallowing her pride, she stiffened her spine and met [MASK]'s gaze head-on. "Fine," she said in a low voice. "When I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut. I dreamed about space instead of princesses and fairy tales.
DarkCorners	48	43572	43572	43620	Morgan	[MASK] stared at her, his smirk fading. "An astronaut," he mused, sounding disappointed. "So what stopped you?" "The realization that my head was better suited for solving puzzles on the ground rather than floating among the stars.
DarkCorners	51	43622	43581	43632	Morgan	"An astronaut," he mused, sounding disappointed. "So what stopped you?" "The realization that my head was better suited for solving puzzles on the ground rather than floating among the stars." [MASK] laughed at that. "That's quite amusing.
DarkCorners	45	43666	43665	43710	Dana	" [MASK] clenched her jaw, a flare of anger igniting in her chest. "Look," she said, her words sharp. "If you want me to spill out all my secrets, then you've got another thing coming.
DarkCorners	46	43712	43680	43726	Morgan	"Look," she said, her words sharp. "If you want me to spill out all my secrets, then you've got another thing coming." [MASK] chuckled, leaning back in his chair with a self-satisfied smirk.
DarkCorners	45	43759	43733	43778	Dana	I'm not asking for your deepest, darkest fears. Yet." He paused, his gaze fixating on her with unsettling intensity. [MASK] felt like a bug under a microscope, each layer of her being unraveled under his scrutinizing eyes.
DarkCorners	49	43788	43787	43836	Dana	" [MASK] bristled but swallowed her indignation. "All right," she said, her voice husky with suppressed emotion. She took a deep breath, exhaled, and then laid her soul bare. "I've never been in love. Not really."
DarkCorners	51	43850	43810	43861	Morgan	She took a deep breath, exhaled, and then laid her soul bare. "I've never been in love. Not really." She had been engaged, but that wasn't the same thing. [MASK]'s eyes widened briefly before he quickly masked his surprise.
DarkCorners	53	43914	43906	43959	Morgan	"Focused." "Hmmm..." [MASK] murmured, tapping on the table again. His smirk returned, albeit softer this time around, a glimmer of curiosity in his eyes. "That's more like it." "Can we get back to the case now?"
DarkCorners	47	43960	43923	43970	Dana	His smirk returned, albeit softer this time around, a glimmer of curiosity in his eyes. "That's more like it." "Can we get back to the case now?" [MASK] asked, a hint of irritation punctuating her question.
DarkCorners	48	44117	44079	44127	Dana	I sent my own letters to the police because it reminded them of their inadequacy. It created fear and chaos. And as we both know, there's something undeniably...satisfying in that." [MASK] gritted her teeth, forcing herself to remain composed.
DarkCorners	48	44175	44148	44196	Morgan	Why do you think he's leaving quotes from the First Amendment?" "Ah, yes." A slow, sinister smile spread across [MASK]'s face. "The First Amendment—freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, and petition.
DarkCorners	51	44255	44215	44266	Dana	Perhaps they believe they are above the law, that their actions are justified by some twisted interpretation of these rights." "Or perhaps they're trying to provoke the authorities, baiting them into action," [MASK] added, her mind racing as she considered the possibilities.
DarkCorners	50	44320	44288	44338	Dana	Just like the one we played. But this time, your killer has upped the stakes. And it seems you're the one who has to play." Before [MASK] could respond, the guard with the neatly-trimmed mustache stepped forward, his voice firm.
DarkCorners	52	44360	44347	44399	Dana	We need to keep to the schedule." "Wait," [MASK] protested. "I have more questions." "Sorry, but we can't make an exception," the guard said, his expression resolute. "We need to maintain order and control here.
DarkCorners	50	44401	44363	44413	Dana	"I have more questions." "Sorry, but we can't make an exception," the guard said, his expression resolute. "We need to maintain order and control here." [MASK] took a deep breath, her frustration boiling beneath the surface.
DarkCorners	49	44453	44414	44463	Morgan	She knew he was right, but it didn't make leaving any easier. "Very well," she said, rising from her seat. The guards quickly escorted her out of the cell, uncuffed [MASK], and closed the heavy steel door behind her.
DarkCorners	46	44614	44578	44624	Dana	"I'd get the last laugh, and it looks like I'm still laughing!" "Ignore him," the guard with the neatly-trimmed mustache urged, his hand on [MASK]'s shoulder. "The man's a lunatic.
DarkCorners	55	44674	44637	44692	Dana	And worst of all, she couldn't think of anything useful she'd gleaned from speaking with him. Had this whole trip been a waste? As they reached the end of the corridor, [MASK]'s phone rang. She quickly pulled it from her pocket, glancing at the caller ID.
DarkCorners	44	44800	44780	44824	Dana	"On the front steps of city hall, where the latest victim's body is." CHAPTER NINETEEN [MASK]'s heart sank as she pulled up to city hall, the site of the latest murder. Not again, she thought.
DarkCorners	43	44885	44852	44895	Dana	Spectators had gathered behind the barriers, gawking at the gruesome sight—a crumpled body covered with a white sheet, sprawled out on the steps. A heavy feeling settled in [MASK]'s chest, a mixture of guilt and despair.
DarkCorners	45	44917	44896	44941	Blaze	She felt like she had let this woman down by not catching the killer sooner. "Get it together, [MASK]," she mumbled to herself, taking a deep breath as she parked her car. "You can't save everyone.
DarkCorners	50	45015	45000	45050	Dana	There's a needle mark on her arm." "Damn it," [MASK] muttered, clenching her fists at her sides. She felt a pang of anger welling up inside her, but also a renewed determination to find the person responsible for these heinous crimes.
DarkCorners	54	45147	45131	45185	Sam	If temporarily banning these gatherings saves a single life, it's worth it." [MASK] nodded, his eyes telling her he knew better than to argue. "I'll make the call." He pulled out his phone and began tapping the screen, taking a few steps away.
DarkCorners	54	45212	45194	45248	Dana	The sun hung high in the sky, casting stark shadows across the steps of city hall as [MASK] studied the faces of the onlookers. She searched for any sign of recognition or guilt, but they all seemed to be united in their shock and horror at the senseless loss of life.
DarkCorners	47	45274	45249	45296	Sam	The air was crisp with the promise of an early autumn, carrying the distant scent of decaying leaves. A few moments later, [MASK] put his phone away and sighed. "I talked to the mayor, and he seemed to understand the urgency.
DarkCorners	51	45314	45282	45333	Dana	"I talked to the mayor, and he seemed to understand the urgency. He's going to make it happen as quickly as possible." "Good," [MASK] said, nodding. She cleared her throat, turning her attention back to the crime at hand.
DarkCorners	51	45356	45334	45385	Sam	"So what about this murder? Any leads so far? Physical evidence? Witnesses?" "Nothing," [MASK] replied, his voice heavy with frustration. "No witnesses, no physical evidence. We haven't found a quote from the First Amendment, either.
DarkCorners	50	45387	45365	45415	Dana	"No witnesses, no physical evidence. We haven't found a quote from the First Amendment, either." [MASK] furrowed her brow, surprised by this revelation. The killer had left quotes from the First Amendment near the other victims, so why not now?
DarkCorners	41	45449	45416	45457	Sam	Was it possible that they were dealing with a copycat? Or maybe the killer was trying to throw them off course? "Are you ready to see the body?" [MASK] asked, pulling her from her thoughts.
DarkCorners	48	45458	45458	45506	Dana	[MASK]'s stomach churned at the prospect, but she nodded, steeling herself for what lay ahead. "Let's do it." Together, they ascended the city hall steps, moving past the uniformed officers and forensic technicians working diligently at the scene.
DarkCorners	41	45596	45567	45608	Dana	Her raven-black hair framed her delicate features, and her dark eyes were closed, hiding the intelligence and determination that had once shone through them. [MASK] took a deep breath, swallowing the lump in her throat.
DarkCorners	56	45907	45853	45909	Sam	As she pulled out a small, folded piece of paper, she realized it was yet another quote from the First Amendment, just like those found with the previous victims. She glanced briefly at the quote, unscrambling the letters in mere seconds. "What does it say?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	46	45975	45963	46009	Dana	On that, you have my word." * * * [MASK]'s fingers clenched the crumpled quote from the First Amendment, her expression a mixture of frustration and disgust. With a swift motion, she threw it onto the desk before her.
DarkCorners	51	46248	46244	46295	Sam	" Just then, [MASK]'s phone rang. He answered quickly, his brow furrowing as he listened intently to the person on the other end. "That's great news," he said, a note of relief in his voice. "Thanks for the update.
DarkCorners	48	46311	46272	46320	Dana	"That's great news," he said, a note of relief in his voice. "Thanks for the update. We'll be in touch." As he hung up, he looked at [MASK] with a glimmer of hope in his eyes.
DarkCorners	48	46337	46331	46379	Dana	" "Tell me," [MASK] said, leaning forward in anticipation. "According to the report, the killer injected his victims with a rare poison called tetrodotoxin. It's found in some species of pufferfish and can be lethal even in small doses.
DarkCorners	52	46407	46397	46449	Dana	" "Where could he have gotten it?" [MASK] asked, her mind racing as she tried to piece together this new information. "It's not exactly something you pick up at your local pharmacy. If we can find the poison, we'll find the killer.
DarkCorners	41	46451	46423	46464	Sam	"It's not exactly something you pick up at your local pharmacy. If we can find the poison, we'll find the killer." [MASK] sighed and rubbed his face wearily. "That's just it.
DarkCorners	50	46498	46481	46531	Dana	The only way to obtain it is through illegal means, like the black market." [MASK]'s frustration deepened, but she refused to give up. "Then we start looking into the black market. We have to find where this killer got the poison from.
DarkCorners	53	46626	46581	46634	Dana	If that doesn't pan out, I'm more than happy to make some calls and see if we can't figure out who's been selling tetrodotoxin on the black market, and more importantly, who their recent customers were." [MASK] nodded, on board with this plan.
DarkCorners	45	46698	46681	46726	Michaels	She rose and stepped out into the hallway, bracing herself for the conversation ahead. "[MASK]," she answered, her voice steady despite the knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. Talking with her boss never seemed to go well.
DarkCorners	52	46780	46748	46800	Dana	"I told you I wanted frequent updates on this case, so why haven't I heard from you?" "I apologize for not being more communicative," [MASK] replied, clenching her free hand into a fist. "The good news is we're making progress.
DarkCorners	46	46837	46801	46847	Michaels	We just found out that the killer used tetrodotoxin to poison his victims. It's a substance found in a number of fish and land animals, notably pufferfish—" "Pufferfish?" [MASK] cut her off, his voice rising in anger.
DarkCorners	46	46882	46867	46913	Dana	Real progress! The mayor is breathing down my neck, demanding answers!" [MASK] gritted her teeth, trying to keep her frustration in check. "We're doing everything we can, sir. We're exploring new leads as we speak.
DarkCorners	43	46935	46895	46938	Dana	"We're doing everything we can, sir. We're exploring new leads as we speak." "Maybe your best isn't good enough," he snapped, the words stinging like a slap to [MASK]'s face.
DarkCorners	51	47191	47188	47239	Michaels	She understood that [MASK] was under immense pressure, with the mayor breathing down his neck for answers, but it didn't excuse the way he treated her. It felt like a constant battle just to prove herself, even after all her accomplishments and dedication to her work.
DarkCorners	44	47356	47356	47400	Dana	[MASK] appreciated his support more than she could say. In the face of adversity, their partnership had always been her anchor. Together, they had overcome countless obstacles and solved some of the most complex cases the FBI had ever seen.
DarkCorners	49	47401	47380	47429	Dana	Together, they had overcome countless obstacles and solved some of the most complex cases the FBI had ever seen. [MASK]'s gaze returned to the derelict building, its crumbling bricks and shattered windows a stark contrast to the autumn sunlight filtering through the trees around them.
DarkCorners	45	47545	47520	47565	Dana	"Isn't that what makes our jobs so much fun? Finding the answers to questions like that?" Rolling her eyes, [MASK] opened the car door and stepped out, inhaling the crisp air as she tried to calm her nerves.
DarkCorners	56	47570	47566	47622	Sam	Together, she and [MASK] walked toward the decaying building, each step loud in the silent street. A woman with unkempt hair and a tattered coat appeared from around a corner, moving toward the building with her shoulders hunched. Her eyes darted furtively about, as if expecting trouble at any moment.
DarkCorners	49	47687	47659	47708	Sam	"I don't think someone like our killer, who can blend in so well with crowds, would live here." "Or," [MASK] said, "it could be the perfect place for him to hide. Low profile, plenty of distractions.
DarkCorners	50	47774	47769	47819	Sam	She exchanged a glance with [MASK] before pushing the door open, steeling herself for whatever lay beyond. The scene that greeted them was straight out of a nightmare. A haze of smoke hung heavy in the air, carrying the acrid scent of burnt plastic and chemicals.
DarkCorners	46	47842	47820	47866	Dana	Bodies sprawled across the floor and dilapidated furniture, some twitching in the throes of a high while others lay motionless. [MASK]'s instincts screamed at her to leave this godforsaken place, but she knew they couldn't afford to dismiss any potential leads.
DarkCorners	45	47903	47880	47925	Dana	The pair moved cautiously through the dimly lit room, stepping over discarded needles and avoiding the dazed stares of the inhabitants. [MASK] couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for these lost souls trapped in a cycle of addiction and despair.
DarkCorners	41	47949	47926	47967	Dana	The desperation hanging in the air was palpable, each person lost within their own private hell. "Excuse me," [MASK] called out to a gaunt woman slumped against the wall, her glassy eyes staring into nothingness.
DarkCorners	47	48056	48039	48086	Dana	The man mumbled something unintelligible and drifted back into his stupor. "Damn it," [MASK] muttered under her breath, feeling like they were chasing ghosts. But just as she was about to give up hope, a deep voice interrupted their search.
DarkCorners	52	48098	48092	48144	Dana	That would be me." [MASK] spun around to find herself face-to-face with a tall, balding man sporting a faded tattoo of the Constitution on his left forearm. His eyes were clear and alert, standing in stark contrast to the dazed expressions surrounding them.
DarkCorners	49	48205	48194	48243	Zimmerman	We'd like to ask you a few questions." [MASK] arched an eyebrow, seemingly unfazed by their presence. "Well, I don't have much of a choice, do I?" "Can you tell us what you're doing here?"
DarkCorners	47	48306	48286	48333	Milo	"I can imagine it's even harder when you're a registered sex offender." At that, [MASK]'s façade of nonchalance wavered, and he shifted uncomfortably on his feet. "That was a long time ago," he muttered defensively.
DarkCorners	59	48428	48379	48438	Dana	"You two were friends at one point, is that correct?" "I hardly knew her," he replied defensively, his voice cracking slightly. "Look, I've got to go." He glanced at the door, then back at [MASK], who stood between him and his escape route.
DarkCorners	53	49080	49071	49124	Michaels	"With all due respect, sir—" [MASK] cut her off. "It's been a taxing case already, so it just makes sense to share the load. Wouldn't want you getting burned out." He chuckled, but there was no humor in the sound.
DarkCorners	49	49401	49400	49449	Zimmerman	" [MASK] shifted uncomfortably in his chair, beads of sweat forming on his brow. "Yeah," he muttered reluctantly. "We were friends. That's all it was, though." "But then things went sour, didn't they?"
DarkCorners	47	49450	49424	49471	Strickland	"We were friends. That's all it was, though." "But then things went sour, didn't they?" [MASK] continued, pushing harder. "She rejected you, and you didn't take that well, did you?
DarkCorners	53	49494	49456	49509	Zimmerman	"She rejected you, and you didn't take that well, did you? You started stalking her, obsessing over her every move." "Look, I was angry, okay?" [MASK] snapped, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape.
DarkCorners	48	49571	49544	49592	Zimmerman	"And as it turns out, you have access to that very same substance through your work at the aquarium, don't you?" [MASK]'s face paled further, his eyes widening in fear. "That doesn't mean I used it!"
DarkCorners	49	49713	49713	49762	Dana	[MASK] doubted he would've been so cheerful if she'd been the only person in the room with him. She needed to set that grievance aside, however. What mattered most was the case. Her jaw tightened as she continued to watch the interrogation unfold.
DarkCorners	49	49765	49763	49812	Zimmerman	Something about [MASK]'s reaction left her feeling uneasy. "I don't think we've really proven anything," she said quietly, voicing her doubts. "Just because he had access to the poison doesn't mean anything by itself. It's circumstantial.
DarkCorners	45	49859	49828	49873	Dana	"He was harassing two of the victims, and we have a picture of him at a third victim's rally." "It looks that way," [MASK] corrected. "It's not clear. It could be someone else.
DarkCorners	48	49891	49874	49922	Dana	" "Regardless, where there's smoke, there's fire." He smiled at [MASK] in a way that was both paternal and patronizing. "Don't overthink things. You've done your part; now it's time to take a break.
DarkCorners	51	49987	49987	50038	Dana	[MASK] pressed her lips together as she weighed her answer. "I don't know," she said. "He's suspicious, for sure…" She trailed off, unsure exactly how to voice her doubts. It was more a gut feeling than anything else.
DarkCorners	48	50049	50008	50056	Dana	"He's suspicious, for sure…" She trailed off, unsure exactly how to voice her doubts. It was more a gut feeling than anything else. "I think a jury will buy it." [MASK] stared at her partner, surprised.
DarkCorners	41	50157	50144	50185	Dana	The one in your head?" "Look at him." [MASK] gestured at the mirror. "The person we're after is cunning, methodical—someone who always seems to be a step ahead of us.
DarkCorners	52	50186	50163	50215	Zimmerman	"The person we're after is cunning, methodical—someone who always seems to be a step ahead of us. [MASK], on the other hand, has shown nothing but impulsivity and desperation." She paused, her eyes narrowing as she studied the man in question.
DarkCorners	45	50225	50202	50247	Kim	She paused, her eyes narrowing as she studied the man in question. "He may very well have wanted to hurt [MASK], but is he really the kind of guy who'd sneak up on her and jab her with a needle?
DarkCorners	50	50274	50257	50307	Michaels	Then he turned and placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Whatever the case, [MASK] has made his decision, so it's out of our hands now. You've done your part. Just take the boss's advice and get some rest for once.
DarkCorners	47	50415	50409	50456	Dana	Stepping out into the hallway, [MASK] glanced at the clock on the wall—noon already. Sunlight filtered through the windows, casting a warm glow on the bustling police station. She could hear laughter up ahead, and the sound drew her closer.
DarkCorners	46	50457	50427	50473	Michaels	Sunlight filtered through the windows, casting a warm glow on the bustling police station. She could hear laughter up ahead, and the sound drew her closer. [MASK] stood with a group of officers, his stern expression momentarily replaced by a grin.
DarkCorners	48	50545	50527	50575	Dana	The smile on his face suggested he was trying to put the tension between them aside. But [MASK] wasn't in the mood for camaraderie or jokes. She waved him off and slipped into another room, closing the door behind her with a quiet click.
DarkCorners	53	50576	50576	50629	Dana	[MASK] stood in the dark conference room, her gaze fixated on the case files strewn across the table. The sound of laughter from the hallway outside seemed distant and hollow as she mulled over the details of the investigation. She clenched her fists, her knuckles turning white with determination.
DarkCorners	52	50810	50773	50825	Maria	He admired the way she gestured animatedly while chatting with her friends, the easy grace of her movements. There was something undeniably alluring about her, which only served to fuel his obsession further. [MASK] was a journalist—passionate, ambitious, and unafraid to tackle controversial issues.
DarkCorners	51	50872	50864	50915	Maria	For weeks, the man had been watching [MASK]—observing her habits, learning her schedule, and even eavesdropping on her conversations when he could. He'd become so familiar with her routine that it felt like he knew her intimately, even though they'd never spoken.
DarkCorners	52	50948	50925	50977	Maria	Today, he planned to introduce himself in a way she would never forget. As the man contemplated his upcoming meeting with [MASK], a bell tinkled, announcing the arrival of a new patron. A uniformed police officer entered the cafe, and the man's body stiffened involuntarily.
DarkCorners	47	51330	51313	51360	Maria	Just as the man allowed himself a brief moment of respite, however, he noticed that [MASK] was getting up from her seat, preparing to leave the cafe. The man's heart skipped a beat—he couldn't let her slip away now.
DarkCorners	47	51386	51344	51391	Maria	The man's heart skipped a beat—he couldn't let her slip away now. Trying not to draw attention to himself, he hastily got up and headed for the door, ensuring his gaze wasn't fixed on [MASK] as he did so.
DarkCorners	41	51397	51392	51433	Maria	Once outside, he spotted [MASK] walking down the city street, engrossed in a conversation on her cell phone. Keeping a safe distance, the man followed her like a shadow, trying his best not to look suspicious.
DarkCorners	52	51503	51459	51511	Maria	"Stay calm," he reminded himself. "Just blend in. Nobody knows what you've done or what you're about to do." As he trailed her, the man couldn't help but marvel at how innocently [MASK] seemed to trust the world around her.
DarkCorners	50	51565	51536	51586	Maria	It only fueled his desire to claim her as his next victim, an innocent lamb led to the slaughter by her own naivety. "Get ready, [MASK]," the man thought, his fingers twitching with anticipation. "You have no idea what's coming.
DarkCorners	46	51594	51578	51624	Maria	"You have no idea what's coming." As the man continued to follow [MASK], his curiosity grew. Where was she going? He racked his brain, recalling every detail he'd learned about her routine over the past few weeks.
DarkCorners	48	51692	51688	51736	Maria	" Just then, [MASK] turned and cut through an alley, still talking animatedly on her phone. The alleyway was narrow, flanked by brick walls adorned with graffiti and grime. A shiver of anticipation shot through the man—it was the perfect opportunity.
DarkCorners	49	51863	51815	51864	Maria	"Patience," the man told himself, clenching his fist around the needle. "Wait for the right moment." He took a deep breath, feeling the cold autumn air fill his lungs, and forced himself to keep a safe distance from [MASK].
DarkCorners	52	51937	51937	51989	Maria	[MASK] finally reached the front door of her house, her keys jingling in her trembling hand as she fumbled to find the right one. The man hid behind a parked car a short distance away, his eyes scanning the quiet street and the surrounding houses for any potential witnesses.
DarkCorners	49	52106	52092	52141	Maria	With every passing second, he grew more convinced that he could get to [MASK] here, undetected, and escape before anyone noticed what had happened. "Time to finish what I started," he whispered to himself, his heart pounding fiercely in his chest.
DarkCorners	42	52156	52142	52184	Maria	Seizing the opportunity, the man sprang from his hiding spot and rushed toward [MASK]. His plan was simple: jab her with the needle and pretend it had been an accident, all while wearing a mask of innocent concern.
DarkCorners	51	52193	52158	52209	Maria	His plan was simple: jab her with the needle and pretend it had been an accident, all while wearing a mask of innocent concern. But as he neared her, something alerted [MASK] to his presence, and she turned just in time to see him closing in.
DarkCorners	54	52265	52232	52286	Maria	The sound shattered the calm afternoon air like a hammer on glass, surely alerting anyone within earshot. Panicked, the man abandoned any pretense of innocence and lunged forward, backing [MASK] against the front door of her home. He loomed over her, the needle held menacingly in his hand.
DarkCorners	55	52297	52274	52329	Maria	He loomed over her, the needle held menacingly in his hand. Just before he could plunge the needle, however, [MASK] kicked out, her shin connecting with his groin. The man let out a pained grunt, doubling over involuntarily as the sharp and sudden pain radiated through his body.
DarkCorners	49	52344	52344	52393	Maria	[MASK] tried to slip past him. The man, however, reached out an arm, tackling her to the ground. She was screaming, swiping at his face with her fingernails like a wild animal as the man's hand pawed blindly around for the needle.
DarkCorners	45	52500	52490	52535	Maria	All he had to do was plunge the needle into [MASK]'s arm and then get out of here as quickly as possible. But he hesitated. It wasn't supposed to go this way—none of it should have gone this way.
DarkCorners	53	52611	52577	52630	Maria	"I'll just have to take her, then leave her somewhere else, somewhere public." Capping the needle and returning it to his pocket, he slipped one hand beneath [MASK]'s legs and the other behind her shoulders. He hefted her, surprised how light she was.
DarkCorners	46	52673	52631	52677	Maria	It would take time to figure out the location...but until then, he would just have to keep her on ice. "Looks like you're coming home with me", he thought as he staggered away from [MASK]'s front door.
DarkCorners	54	53177	53177	53231	Emily	[MASK] had written that she'd encountered this stranger throughout her routine: at the grocery store, the library, and the park. Unfortunately, this wasn't much to go on—there was no physical description, and the locations were common enough that anyone could've been at them.
DarkCorners	47	53274	53232	53279	Emily	Then again, we know we're dealing with someone highly educated and familiar with the Constitution. Maybe, just maybe, someone at the library will remember him. First, however, she needed to figure out which library [MASK] had been talking about.
DarkCorners	48	53379	53375	53423	Dana	Using her phone, [MASK] looked up the library. She scrolled through the pictures, the events page, and finally landed on the staff page. All the staff, however, were either young women or old men, none of whom fit the profile.
DarkCorners	47	53433	53424	53471	Dana	Sighing and not knowing what else to do, [MASK] began skimming the library's old blog posts. Most of them were about author readings and other local events, but one jumped out at her. The title was 'Turning a New Leaf.'
DarkCorners	44	53851	53843	53887	Sam	She glanced at her phone, noticing that [MASK] hadn't responded to the text she'd left on her way out of the police station. Taking a deep breath, she hit the call button and waited for him to pick up.
DarkCorners	52	53893	53870	53922	Sam	Taking a deep breath, she hit the call button and waited for him to pick up. "Hey, it's [MASK]. I can't take your call right now, but leave me a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
DarkCorners	42	54014	53997	54039	Dana	The building was an architectural relic, nestled between modern skyscrapers and busy city streets. As [MASK] approached, she admired the grand archway above the entrance, its intricate carvings showcasing the importance of knowledge and free thought throughout history.
DarkCorners	44	54047	54040	54084	Dana	Pushing open the heavy wooden doors, [MASK] entered the library and was met with the comforting scent of old books and polished wood. She paused for a moment, taking in the vast expanse of shelves that stretched toward the high ceiling.
DarkCorners	47	54111	54110	54157	Dana	As [MASK] strolled deeper into the library, she felt a sense of reverence for this temple of learning. Amidst the hushed whispers and rustling pages, she could almost hear the echoes of past debates and intellectual pursuits that had taken place within these walls.
DarkCorners	53	54196	54189	54242	Dana	a gentle voice interrupted her thoughts. [MASK] turned to see a middle-aged librarian with short, wavy gray hair and a pair of wire-rimmed glasses perched on her nose. The woman's warm, brown eyes displayed genuine concern as she offered a small, polite smile.
DarkCorners	43	54335	54316	54359	Dana	What do you need to know?" "Could you tell me what he was like?" [MASK] asked, studying the woman's expression for any hints of insight. The librarian sighed, the memories clearly painful to recall.
DarkCorners	48	54361	54349	54397	John	The librarian sighed, the memories clearly painful to recall. "[MASK] was a very intelligent man, no doubt about that. But he was also quite...intense. He had a strong passion for constitutional laws, especially those pertaining to freedom of speech.
DarkCorners	48	54419	54373	54421	Dana	But he was also quite...intense. He had a strong passion for constitutional laws, especially those pertaining to freedom of speech. Unfortunately, that passion often led to heated arguments with other employees and patrons." "How so?" [MASK] asked.
DarkCorners	55	54510	54479	54534	Dana	He became so angry that he threatened the other employee, saying he'd make sure they never worked in a library again." "Obsession with perfection," [MASK] mused aloud. It fits the profile. The librarian nodded solemnly. "Yes, that's one way to put it.
DarkCorners	43	54656	54631	54674	Miller	Frustration bubbled within her, mingled with concern for her partner. However, she couldn't wait any longer; she had to confront [MASK] on her own. "Anything else I can help you with?" the librarian asked.
DarkCorners	48	54982	54944	54992	Dana	Pedestrians rushed past her, their faces buried in phones or lost in thought, completely oblivious to the fact that a serial killer could be living right under their noses. As she reached the pawnshop, [MASK] noticed a neon OPEN sign flickering in the window.
DarkCorners	56	55053	55022	55078	Dana	The dim lighting cast long shadows across the dusty shelves and cluttered display cases. It seemed like a place lost in time, untouched by the busy streets outside. [MASK] didn't see any other people in the shop, but she could feel the weight of countless stories behind each item on display.
DarkCorners	59	55185	55139	55198	JFK	As she wandered deeper into the store, her gaze was drawn to a collection of controversial historical items. A tarnished silver pocket watch engraved with a Confederate flag caught her eye, and next to it, a tome written about the assassination of [MASK] with the dubious title, The Last, Final Protest Against Tyranny.
DarkCorners	44	55212	55199	55243	Dana	Whoever owns this place must have a very strange sense of patriotism, [MASK] thought to herself with a shudder. In one corner, she noticed a glass case containing a set of antique dueling pistols alongside a tattered copy of the Constitution.
DarkCorners	46	55282	55244	55290	Dana	A handwritten note beside the pistols claimed they had once belonged to a prominent Southern gentleman who had used them to defend his honor during the Civil War. "Such a bizarre combination of items," [MASK] mused, trying to suppress her uneasiness.
DarkCorners	56	55358	55348	55404	Dana	A faint sound from the depths of the shop caught [MASK]'s attention, breaking her contemplation of the peculiar collection. "Hello?" she called out. "Is anyone there?" As if in response, a sleek black cat emerged from the shadows, its green eyes fixed on her.
DarkCorners	45	55416	55416	55461	Dana	[MASK] crouched down and scratched behind the cat's ears, feeling a sense of comfort in its presence amidst the unsettling atmosphere. "Where's your owner, huh?" she asked softly, noticing how the cat seemed to crave affection.
DarkCorners	47	55492	55449	55496	Dana	she asked softly, noticing how the cat seemed to crave affection. It purred as it rubbed against her hand before turning its attention to a nearby unmarked door. The cat meowed and scratched insistently at the door, clearly wanting [MASK] to open it.
DarkCorners	56	55501	55497	55553	Dana	"Alright," [MASK] murmured, growing curious. "Let's see what's behind door number one." With a deep breath, she turned the handle and opened the door. The moment she did so, the cat darted through the doorway and disappeared down a flight of dark steps.
DarkCorners	47	55554	55519	55566	Dana	With a deep breath, she turned the handle and opened the door. The moment she did so, the cat darted through the doorway and disappeared down a flight of dark steps. [MASK] hesitated, her heart pounding as she peered into the gloom.
DarkCorners	49	55624	55593	55642	Dana	"Damn it," she muttered, torn between her desire for answers and her uneasiness about descending into the unknown. Ultimately, her investigative instincts won out. [MASK] carefully took one step at a time, the creaking wooden steps seeming to protest her intrusion.
DarkCorners	53	55720	55686	55739	Dana	As she reached the bottom of the stairs, the musty odor intensified. The dirt floor beneath her feet was uneven, littered with dust and debris that crunched under her boots. [MASK] swept the beam of light from her phone around the basement, revealing an eerie scene before her.
DarkCorners	48	55790	55787	55835	Dana	The nape of [MASK]'s neck prickled as she examined the other objects: a life-sized mannequin dressed in tattered clothing, a collection of old dolls with cracked porcelain faces and unblinking eyes, stacks of yellowed newspapers that seemed to chronicle decades of tragedy.
DarkCorners	50	55913	55866	55916	Dana	I'm not sure which items are less appealing, the ones upstairs or the ones down here. While she was still studying this strange assortment of items, she heard a groaning sound overhead. The sound was faint, yet distinct enough to catch [MASK]'s attention.
DarkCorners	52	56036	55995	56047	Dana	They were large, their abdomens swollen and covered with fine hairs that shimmered in the dim light. Long, spindly legs extended from their bodies, clinging to the pipes and walls. Despite her training and experience, [MASK] couldn't help but shudder at the sight of them.
DarkCorners	49	56132	56102	56151	Dana	Two bowls rested there, one empty and the other half-filled with murky water. A bag of cat food lay nearby, its contents strewn about. [MASK] knelt down and opened the bag, only to find that the food inside was moldy and inedible.
DarkCorners	51	56168	56152	56203	Dana	"Whoever works here doesn't give a damn about you, do they?" [MASK] murmured to the cat, a pang of sympathy rising within her. She knew that the state of the cat's living conditions could be a reflection of the person responsible for them.
DarkCorners	50	56361	56361	56411	Dana	[MASK] set the cat down, whispered, "Stay here," and crept cautiously toward the noise. She noticed a tarp hanging on the wall, billowing ever so slightly. Grasping the edge of the tarp, she pulled it back, revealing a hidden doorway.
DarkCorners	55	56412	56381	56436	Dana	She noticed a tarp hanging on the wall, billowing ever so slightly. Grasping the edge of the tarp, she pulled it back, revealing a hidden doorway. [MASK] stepped through the doorway, letting the tarp fall limp behind her, and began feeling along the wall for a light switch.
DarkCorners	43	56438	56437	56480	Dana	When [MASK] at last found the light switch and flicked it on, she was pleasantly surprised to discover that it worked. The room revealed by the overhead fluorescents was starkly different from the cluttered, musty basement she had just left.
DarkCorners	51	56520	56481	56532	Dana	It was cleaner, more organized, with a refrigerator humming quietly in one corner, a table with a few chairs, and a functional cot pressed against the far wall. A sense of unease settled in [MASK]'s gut—it was clear someone had been living here.
DarkCorners	58	56533	56533	56591	Dana	[MASK]'s eyes continued to scan the room, her heart pounding in her ears as she took in every detail. The photographs tacked haphazardly to the walls caught her attention—they were chillingly familiar. As she moved closer, realization struck her like a bolt of lightning: these were the killer's victims.
DarkCorners	46	56677	56647	56693	Dana	No, that seemed unlikely, since the killer hadn't made any efforts to hide the bodies. More likely, they were the killer's next victims. [MASK]'s breath hitched in her throat, her pulse quickening with every picture she studied.
DarkCorners	48	56699	56694	56742	Dana	On a nearby table, [MASK] spotted a stack of handwritten notes on constitutional law, their margins filled with feverish scribblings. A cold shiver ran down her spine as she noticed political pins stuck to the wall, pins taken from the victims' public rallies.
DarkCorners	50	56774	56743	56793	Dana	Farther along the wall, a number of news clippings, which must have come hot off the press, considering the recency of the murders. With growing urgency, [MASK] hurried over to the refrigerator and pulled the door open. A wave of nausea rolled over her.
DarkCorners	43	56888	56882	56925	Dana	CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE Looking around, [MASK] noticed a small door in the wall, almost like a closet. With her gun drawn, she cautiously approached the door, her senses heightened. "Who's there?" she called.
DarkCorners	44	56943	56917	56961	Dana	"Who's there?" she called. In response, she heard a muffled voice that sounded like it was pleading with her. [MASK] thought the voice was female, and her heart clenched with a mixture of dread and determination.
DarkCorners	50	57007	56979	57029	Dana	The door was secured, though, with a thick padlock, its rusty metal surface contrasting with the otherwise clean surroundings. "Damn it," [MASK] muttered under her breath, frustrated by the obstacle standing between her and possibly rescuing the killer's next intended victim.
DarkCorners	51	57066	57054	57105	Dana	In the movies, people often shot padlocks to open them. [MASK] knew, however, there was a good chance that doing so would result in a ricochet, and in such a confined space, a ricochet could be deadly. "Are you okay in there?"
DarkCorners	43	57140	57109	57152	Dana	"I'm here to help." "Please... hurry," came the weak reply from behind the door. The desperation in the woman's voice fueled [MASK]'s urgency, and she racked her brain for a solution.
DarkCorners	51	57158	57153	57204	Dana	"Stay calm," [MASK] said. "I'm going to get you out of there." She racked her brain for a safer way to open the padlock without resorting to gunfire. Her eyes darted around the room, searching for something that could help her.
DarkCorners	51	57223	57205	57256	Miller	On a nearby table, she spotted a set of lock picking tools, probably the very ones [MASK] had used to break into the Liberty Bell Tribune. She grabbed them and knelt down in front of the door, carefully inserting the tension wrench and pick into the keyhole.
DarkCorners	44	57353	57348	57392	Dana	"Got it," [MASK] whispered, relief washing over her as she removed the padlock and swung the door open. Inside the small, dimly-lit space, a woman huddled in the corner, her eyes wide with terror.
DarkCorners	50	57469	57450	57500	Dana	"I thought I was going to die." "That's not going to happen," [MASK] said, her voice calm and steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins. "Because I'm going to get you out of here. Are you okay?
DarkCorners	52	57518	57485	57537	Maria	"Because I'm going to get you out of here. Are you okay? Are you injured?" "He hit me in the head with a brick…" [MASK] swallowed hard, remembering. "It's kind of numb, but I think I'm okay.
DarkCorners	58	57742	57695	57753	Miller	She glanced behind her, wondering if the cat might have gone back upstairs, but the cat was still in the next room, watching curiously. Someone else must be upstairs. But who? Maybe a customer who had wandered in? "Or [MASK]," she thought darkly, preparing for the worst.
DarkCorners	42	57784	57780	57822	Dana	With frenzied haste, [MASK] worked to finish freeing the woman. Her hands were shaking as she sliced through the last of the restraints, the heavy rope feeling like it was mocking her desperate efforts. "Please hurry!"
DarkCorners	53	57970	57955	58008	Dana	The air in the basement felt colder than it had before, oppressive even. [MASK]'s mind raced, sorting through a lifetime of training and experience as she tried to anticipate the killer's next move. Would he burst through the tarp, his eyes wild and filled with rage?
DarkCorners	52	58135	58108	58160	Miller	"If he's on the other side of that tarp, he must see that the light's on in here. Someone as meticulous as [MASK] would remember whether or not he left the light on." Whatever the case, she didn't have to do this alone.
DarkCorners	51	58179	58161	58212	Sam	Careful not to take her eyes off the hidden doorway, she pulled out her phone and called [MASK]. Nothing happened. Glancing at the screen, she saw that she had no signal—not a great surprise, considering all the steel and copper running over her head.
DarkCorners	51	58228	58213	58264	Maria	"Damn it," she murmured, putting the phone away. She and [MASK] were trapped in this musty basement, disconnected from the outside world—and somewhere nearby, perhaps waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike, was a merciless murderer. "No backup?"
DarkCorners	43	58268	58268	58311	Dana	[MASK] glanced at the woman, who was still crouched behind the refrigerator. Her face was pale, her dark eyes wide with fear. She looked to be in her early thirties, her long brown hair disheveled after her ordeal.
DarkCorners	48	58326	58282	58330	Dana	Her face was pale, her dark eyes wide with fear. She looked to be in her early thirties, her long brown hair disheveled after her ordeal. Despite her terror, however, she appeared determined not to break down. [MASK] shook her head.
DarkCorners	52	58550	58519	58571	Dana	"You're a survivor," she said. "You're going to make it through this." A car horn honked on the street outside, jolting [MASK] back to the reality of how close they were to the world outside, yet how far away help seemed.
DarkCorners	54	58653	58620	58674	Dana	"I was supposed to have one just yesterday, but I was told I would have to postpone for a few weeks—something about a public emergency. Why?" [MASK] felt a surge of relief for having insisted they take measures to prevent any other political rallies in the city.
DarkCorners	42	58876	58868	58910	Dana	As they traversed the dimly lit basement, [MASK] couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. She glanced around, taking in the cracked porcelain dolls, tarnished silverware, and other forgotten items covered in plastic that surrounded them.
DarkCorners	50	59032	59027	59077	Dana	"Almost there," [MASK] murmured. Her hand tightened around the grip of her gun as they drew closer to the staircase—their only way out. The air in the basement felt heavy and oppressive, as if the very walls were closing in on them.
DarkCorners	44	59135	59126	59170	Dana	As they neared the foot of the stairs, [MASK] paused, her gaze drawn to a familiar tableau: cracked porcelain dolls with vacant eyes, a monkey wearing a red cap, a stack of yellowed newspapers bound together by fraying twine.
DarkCorners	52	59195	59195	59247	Dana	[MASK] was still puzzling over this discrepancy when something brushed against her legs, making her jump. She looked down to see the cat weaving between her ankles. It moved with a sinuous grace, its fur sleek and black. The cat's presence was both comforting and disconcerting.
DarkCorners	52	59254	59225	59277	Dana	It moved with a sinuous grace, its fur sleek and black. The cat's presence was both comforting and disconcerting. Then the cat moved away from [MASK], walking toward the mannequin. The cat brushed against the mannequin's legs, back and forth, back and forth.
DarkCorners	53	59285	59261	59314	Dana	The cat brushed against the mannequin's legs, back and forth, back and forth. Through the mannequin's tattered clothing, [MASK] could see patches of skin, and they weren't the ghostly white she had seen earlier. No, this mannequin's skin was much more human.
DarkCorners	45	59323	59304	59349	Dana	No, this mannequin's skin was much more human. Too human. Just as realization dawned on [MASK], the mannequin began to move. It lunged at her, the plastic cover hissing over the figure's head as it pushed forward.
DarkCorners	41	59350	59350	59391	Dana	[MASK] tried to raise her gun, but before she could do so, the figure – a man whose eyes burned with a fiery intensity, as she could now clearly see – collided with her, knocking her back.
DarkCorners	48	59428	59418	59466	Dana	And then the world went black. CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN [MASK]'s eyelids fluttered open, her vision hazy and unfocused. As consciousness returned, she registered the chill of the concrete floor beneath her. Her ears were filled with the frantic tempo of her heart.
DarkCorners	47	59541	59532	59579	Dana	In a flash, it all came back to [MASK] and she tried to sit up. She quickly discovered, however, that she was bound as well: her wrists connected by her own handcuffs, her ankles tied with a coil of rough rope.
DarkCorners	59	59625	59601	59660	Dana	"He doesn't know you're awake, and the longer you can keep it that way, the better." As [MASK] tried to think of a way to free herself from her restraints, she recalled a trick she had learned during her time at the FBI academy for opening handcuffs using a bobby pin.
DarkCorners	53	59801	59773	59826	Dana	With an almost imperceptible click, the handcuff released its grip on her wrist, and she exhaled in relief. After quietly setting the handcuffs aside, [MASK] wasted no time in attacking the ropes that bound her legs. Her fingers worked quickly, despite the lingering numbness from her captivity.
DarkCorners	41	59856	59853	59894	Dana	Panic surged through [MASK], and she made a snap decision to pretend she was still tied up and unconscious. She hastily placed the now-open handcuffs back around her wrists, ensuring they weren't actually clipped together.
DarkCorners	48	59915	59874	59922	Miller	She hastily placed the now-open handcuffs back around her wrists, ensuring they weren't actually clipped together. Closing her eyes, she willed her body to go limp and her breathing to slow, hoping to convince [MASK] that she was still out cold.
DarkCorners	46	59979	59956	60002	Miller	As he drew nearer, she dared to peek through her barely opened eyes, straining to get a glimpse of him. [MASK] was a tall, imposing figure, with disheveled hair and a wild look in his eyes that betrayed his unhinged mind.
DarkCorners	57	60029	60003	60060	Dana	His face, illuminated by the pale glow of the screen of the phone he held, looked gaunt and haggard. It suddenly occurred to [MASK] that after staring at the bright screen for so long, it would be difficult for him to see anything in the dark room, giving her a potential advantage.
DarkCorners	59	60297	60248	60307	Miller	She knew that she would have to get close to him and disarm him before he had a chance to draw the weapon. Just then, a rustling sound caught her attention. It sounded like the cat was scratching at its bag of cat food nearby. [MASK] turned his head toward the noise, momentarily distracted.
DarkCorners	52	60386	60340	60392	Miller	Her body collided with his, their forms crashing together with a resounding thud that filled the room. The impact was greater than she had anticipated, but she didn't have time to dwell on the pain that shot through her shoulder as she [MASK] slammed into the grinning monkey.
DarkCorners	48	60761	60736	60784	Maria	Could she hit him? She was an excellent shooter, and she could see the pale glow of the man's face hovering over [MASK]'s shoulder like an evil moon. If this were practice, she would've bet good money on making the shot.
DarkCorners	42	60885	60854	60896	Dana	"I'll give you three seconds, and if you don't drop the gun by then, she dies." "We can work this out," [MASK] said, still hoping she might get a good shot.
DarkCorners	41	61119	61106	61147	Maria	"Now we're going to take a little ride, you and [MASK] here." A sinister grin spread across his face, making him look even more menacing. "I have big plans for both of you.
DarkCorners	48	61150	61138	61186	Dana	"I have big plans for both of you." As [MASK] fought to control her fear, she noticed that her phone was no longer where it had fallen earlier. Confused, she scanned the basement, trying to figure out where it could be.
DarkCorners	54	61191	61171	61225	Maria	Confused, she scanned the basement, trying to figure out where it could be. Her gaze landed on [MASK], whose eyes were wide with terror—but no, that wasn't quite right. There was something else in the woman's eyes, too, something more...controlled.
DarkCorners	56	61459	61415	61471	Miller	" "Why did you leave quotes from the First Amendment at your crime scenes?" She hoped that by engaging him in a discussion about constitutional law, she could exploit his ego and obsession long enough for help to arrive. [MASK] sneered, his eyes narrowing as he regarded her with disdain.
DarkCorners	55	61537	61491	61546	Dana	His face was gaunt and pale, as if he hadn't taken care of himself in several days, yet there was an unsettling intelligence behind his eyes that suggested he was capable of far more than appearances suggested. "Try me," [MASK] said, meeting his gaze head-on.
DarkCorners	56	61547	61547	61603	Miller	[MASK] hesitated for a moment before his lips curled into a grim smile. "Alright then," he said, seemingly unable to resist the urge to debate. "I left those quotes to make a point about the importance of the Constitution, about how this country treats it like a joke.
DarkCorners	42	61785	61754	61796	Dana	Nobody has a damn clue what freedom is—certainly not you and your nosy, oversized agency." "You're trying to teach me a lesson?" [MASK] asked, trying to hide the shock in her voice.
DarkCorners	50	61809	61797	61847	Miller	"There's a war going on in our country," [MASK] said, his eyes lighting up, "a war between those who understand the Constitution and those who don't. I'm just helping the people who do to find the traitors who don't.
DarkCorners	42	61865	61832	61874	Dana	I'm just helping the people who do to find the traitors who don't." "So you're saying that the people you've killed weren't innocent?" [MASK] asked, trying to keep the conversation going.
DarkCorners	57	61882	61875	61932	Miller	"They were...traitors?" [MASK] shook his head, as if disgusted with her. "You're clueless, blind to the truth! Those women pretended to know the Constitution, but they watered it down, turned it into something that couldn't keep this country standing, let alone thriving.
DarkCorners	53	61962	61933	61986	Dana	That's why they had to go. They were fakes, spreading lies and stupidity!" "You talk about the importance of the Constitution," [MASK] said, "and yet you break the law by murdering. How do you reconcile those two?" He smiled grimly.
DarkCorners	52	62001	61987	62039	Dana	"The Constitution doesn't say anything about murder." It occurred to [MASK] that he was right—the only crime defined in the Constitution was treason. She was still thinking of how to reply when she heard a muffled sound from upstairs—a distant knock, perhaps.
DarkCorners	48	62058	62017	62065	Miller	She was still thinking of how to reply when she heard a muffled sound from upstairs—a distant knock, perhaps. Her pulse quickened. Was it possible that help had arrived? She knew she needed to keep [MASK] distracted for as long as possible.
DarkCorners	48	62095	62081	62129	Miller	She racked her brain for another question about the murders as she looked into [MASK]'s eyes, which were filled with a dangerous mix of anger and self-righteousness. "Tell me," she said, trying to sound casual despite her racing heart.
DarkCorners	42	62167	62130	62172	Miller	"If you think these victims didn't truly understand the Constitution, what makes you so sure that you do?" "Because I serve a higher power who really gets the Constitution," [MASK] said with unassailable confidence.
DarkCorners	49	62233	62221	62270	Miller	"You didn't strike me as the religious type." [MASK] opened his mouth as if ready to answer, but then he closed it again. His eyes narrowed shrewdly, as if he had just figured out a trick that had been played on him.
DarkCorners	53	62302	62271	62324	Dana	"Stalling me, huh?" he said with a dark chuckle. "Well, you've had your fun. Now put on the cuffs." Before [MASK] could do so, however, she heard the distinct creak of the door at the top of the stairs opening.
DarkCorners	52	62484	62464	62516	Dana	"Show yourself!" he bellowed up the stairs, his voice reverberating off the damp basement walls. [MASK] watched him, tense and alert. She knew that he was losing control, becoming more desperate and unpredictable by the second—which would only make him more dangerous.
DarkCorners	44	62521	62492	62536	Miller	She knew that he was losing control, becoming more desperate and unpredictable by the second—which would only make him more dangerous. A moment later, [MASK] fired several shots up the stairs, the deafening sound reverberating through the basement.
DarkCorners	44	62983	62943	62987	Maria	His eyes narrowed with fury, his finger tightening on the trigger. But before he could squeeze off a shot, two deafening explosions rang out, filling the room with the smell of gunpowder and the sound of [MASK]'s terrified screams.
DarkCorners	53	63573	63534	63587	Dana	But there was something else nagging at her mind—a feeling of unease, as if perhaps something remained unresolved. She frowned, trying to pinpoint the source of her disquiet. "He's dead, [MASK]," she told herself. "And he's not coming back.
DarkCorners	49	63628	63615	63664	Dana	"Are you feeling okay? You seem a bit spacey." [MASK] hesitated, rubbing the back of her head where a dull ache persisted. "I hit my head pretty hard earlier and blacked out for a moment, but I'll be fine."
DarkCorners	46	63674	63643	63689	Sam	"I hit my head pretty hard earlier and blacked out for a moment, but I'll be fine." She forced a smile, not wanting to worry [MASK] any further. His concern deepened as he took in her slightly pale complexion.
DarkCorners	48	63744	63718	63766	Sam	"I'm fine, really. I'll see one of the medics later. I just want to be here for this." [MASK] sighed, as if to say there was nothing he could do about her stubbornness, and then crossed his arms.
DarkCorners	43	63837	63813	63856	Dana	I should've taken your calls earlier, though—I'm sorry about that." His voice was tinged with guilt, but [MASK] waved it away. "You had no idea what I was up against," she said.
DarkCorners	41	63950	63920	63961	Miller	"What is that?" The scientist glanced at her, then at the notebook. "It appears to be some kind of journal. Found it among [MASK]'s things." "Can I see it?"
DarkCorners	56	63985	63965	64021	Dana	"Sure," the scientist replied, handing her a pair of latex gloves. Once properly gloved, [MASK] took the journal and examined it. The cover was tattered, and the pages were yellowed with age. It had an air of chaos, much like the man who had penned it.
DarkCorners	54	64022	64006	64060	Dana	It had an air of chaos, much like the man who had penned it. [MASK]'s eyes scanned the pages, her brow furrowed in concentration. The handwriting was a tangled mess of loops and jagged lines, as if the author had been in the throes of a manic episode.
DarkCorners	44	64087	64077	64121	Sam	"Can you make any sense of it?" [MASK] asked, leaning in to get a better look at the journal. His brown hair fell into his eyes, and he absently brushed it away with the back of his hand.
DarkCorners	45	64475	64444	64489	Sam	"I want you to know that I spoke with the mayor, and I personally mentioned both your names." "Thank you very much, sir," [MASK] said in a voice that sounded half-pleased, half-uninterested.
DarkCorners	43	64561	64553	64596	Sam	She wished she could just leave and let [MASK] handle the rest. All she wanted was to return to the hotel and get some sleep. The exhaustion weighed heavily on her body, and each passing minute felt like an eternity.
DarkCorners	49	64598	64580	64629	Dana	The exhaustion weighed heavily on her body, and each passing minute felt like an eternity. As [MASK] leaned against a table for support, the cat that had been lingering nearby stretched up on her leg, its tiny claws scratching at the notebook she was holding.
DarkCorners	49	64687	64644	64693	Dana	In the bottom corner of the cover, partially obscured by a smear of ink, was a faint series of lines that resembled a hastily scribbled message. It was difficult to read the writing, but two words stood out to [MASK]: 'higher power.'
DarkCorners	48	64699	64694	64742	Miller	They reminded her of something [MASK] had said earlier: 'He makes the rules. I am just his soldier.' She felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up. "He never answered my question about religion," she thought.
DarkCorners	48	64754	64717	64765	Miller	She felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up. "He never answered my question about religion," she thought. Now that she considered it, it occurred to her that [MASK] had been far more…unhinged than she'd expected.
DarkCorners	49	64853	64841	64890	Sam	"You look pale." "It's not over, [MASK]," she said in a hollow voice. "It's not over." He frowned, gazing at her as if he must be missing something. "What are you talking about?
DarkCorners	48	64891	64869	64917	Miller	" He frowned, gazing at her as if he must be missing something. "What are you talking about? [MASK] is dead—and don't you dare suggest we got the wrong guy." "It's not that," she said.
DarkCorners	41	64956	64927	64968	Dana	She paused, choosing her words carefully. "I'm just not convinced he was working alone." "You think he had a partner?" [MASK] glanced down at the notebook again and took a tentative breath.
DarkCorners	58	64981	64981	65039	EPILOGUE	[MASK] "This should be interesting," the Admiral muttered as he sat down in his plush armchair, swirling a glass of whiskey. He reached for the remote and turned on the television, which immediately sprang to life on a news station—no great surprise, since the Admiral watched very little else.
DarkCorners	54	65190	65178	65232	Miller	"Authorities are still scouring the premises for evidence, and while [MASK] is now dead, investigators are determined to uncover the full extent of his crimes," the reporter continued, his voice grave. The Admiral took another sip of his whiskey, his eyes flickering lazily across the screen.
DarkCorners	57	65269	65247	65304	Miller	It was the same evidence he had made sure was removed long before anyone could find it—anything that would suggest [MASK] hadn't been acting alone. The reporter continued, "It is believed he killed four women, and nearly two more – including an FBI agent – before he was finally stopped.
DarkCorners	55	65314	65276	65331	Tom	The reporter continued, "It is believed he killed four women, and nearly two more – including an FBI agent – before he was finally stopped." "Such a tragic loss of life, [MASK]," the news anchor said from his desk at the studio, his expression somber.
DarkCorners	48	65469	65446	65494	Miller	As the screen cut back to the newsroom, the Admiral frowned, feeling a growing sense of irritation. It wasn't [MASK]'s death that bothered him; rather, it was the fact that his former pawn hadn't managed to get his message across.
DarkCorners	55	65539	65531	65586	Miller	The Admiral chided himself for ever having recruited [MASK] in the first place. "Next time," he muttered beneath his breath, "I will have higher standards." He turned off the television, plunging the room into darkness save for the faint glow of the city outside his window.
DarkCorners	45	65631	65628	65673	Miller	No matter how [MASK]'s story ended, the wheels were already in motion for something far greater. The Admiral rose from his chair, the weight of his frustrations momentarily lifting as he took a long sip from the glass in his hand.
DarkCorners	53	65855	65814	65867	Miller	The skyline was a jagged silhouette against the inky sky, daring him to confront the challenges that lay ahead. "The next one will do better," the Admiral murmured above the hum of the city. "[MASK]'s failure only serves to prove how vital my message is.
