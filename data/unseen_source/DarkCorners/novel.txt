PROLOGUE




The crisp morning air of early autumn nipped at Emily Haven's cheeks as she stood at the edge of the stage, which had been set up across from the Fifth Circuit Courthouse in downtown Philadelphia, not far from the Liberty Bell. It was an ideal setting for the rally she had spent months organizing.

This is it, she thought, nearly trembling with anticipation. This is your big moment.

She could feel the energy buzzing around her as hundreds of people began to gather, their voices a mix of anticipation and excitement. Could this really be happening? Or was she only dreaming?

She took a deep breath and closed her eyes. In her mind, she visualized herself stepping onto the stage with confidence, addressing the crowd with passion and conviction. She focused on the cause that had brought her here: lobbying for government transparency and fighting to hold those in power accountable for their actions. As a community organizer for Citizens for Social Justice, she knew firsthand the importance of grassroots activism and giving a voice to the disenfranchised.

"Emily! Are you ready?" called out Ben, a fellow organizer and friend. He stepped up next to her, his warm hand on her shoulder, and smiled encouragingly. "It's time to show them what we're made of."

Emily opened her eyes and glanced at him, nodding. "Let's do this," she said, her voice steady despite the nerves fluttering in her stomach.

The stage loomed before her, sturdy wooden planks creaking underfoot as she made her way up the steps. The noise from the gathering crowd slowly grew into a cacophony of cheers and applause, the sound washing over her like a wave. Her heart racing, Emily briefly scanned the faces in the sea of people, all of them eager to listen to her words and support the cause she held dear.

"Good morning, Philadelphia!" she cried out into the microphone, her voice strong and clear. The crowd responded enthusiastically, further fueling her excitement. "Today, we stand united in our fight for government transparency! We demand accountability from those who claim to represent us, and we will not be silenced!"

As she spoke, Emily felt the weight of her responsibility and the importance of her message. She thought of the countless meetings, op-eds she had written, and the long hours spent organizing events like this one. The countless conversations with people who had shared their stories and struggles fueled her desire to make a difference in their lives.

"Too often, our government operates in the shadows, making decisions that impact all of us without our knowledge or consent," Emily continued. "Together, we will shine a light on these hidden actions and hold our elected officials accountable!"

The crowd roared in approval, their fervor mirroring her own. As she looked out upon the sea of faces – young and old, from all walks of life – Emily felt a surge of pride and determination.

This was her purpose: to be a catalyst for change and to empower others to join her in the fight for social justice.

"But we cannot do this alone," Emily said, her voice ringing out over the crowd. "We need the support of every citizen who believes in the power of transparency and accountability. We need to come together as a community, and as a nation, to demand change."

She paused, taking a deep breath and gathering her thoughts. She had been working towards this moment for so long, it was almost surreal to be standing here, speaking to so many people who shared her passion. But there was still so much work to be done.

"We must remember that change does not come easy," Emily said, her tone serious. "It takes perseverance, dedication, and most importantly, unity. We must stand together to fight for what we believe in, for the betterment of our society and the world we live in."

The crowd erupted in a thunderous applause, their cheers filling the air and energizing Emily. She felt a renewed sense of purpose and determination, knowing that this was only the beginning of a long and arduous journey. But with the support of her fellow activists and the community at large, she was ready to lead the charge toward a more just and equitable world.

With a determined smile, Emily stepped down from the stage and began to walk through the crowd. The energy was palpable, and she could feel the shared passion for change emanating from the diverse group of people gathered before her.

"Excuse me," Emily said gently as she approached a teenage girl standing near the front of the crowd. "May I ask you a question?"

The girl looked surprised but nodded, her eyes wide with curiosity. Handing her the microphone, Emily asked, "Why are you here today? What brings you to this rally?"

The girl hesitated briefly before replying, "I'm here because I want to be part of the change. I don't want to just sit back and watch as our government keeps secrets from us. I want to have a say in what happens to my future."

Emily smiled warmly at the girl, feeling a sense of pride swelling within her chest. "Thank you for being here," she said. "It's so important that even the very young have a voice in our society. Your presence here today shows that you are committed to making a difference, and together, we can fight for the transparency and accountability we deserve."

As the crowd erupted in cheers once more, Emily returned to the stage, feeling the support of every person present.

"Let us not forget that it is through the collective efforts of every individual, no matter their age or background, that we can create meaningful change," Emily declared. "Together, we have the power to challenge the status quo and demand a better world for ourselves and future generations."

As Emily spoke, she sensed that they were on the cusp of something monumental—a turning point in their fight for government transparency and accountability. The road ahead would be long and filled with challenges, but with the support of her fellow activists and the community at large, she knew they could make a difference.

Just then, she became aware of an odd, slightly uncomfortable sensation in her arm. Had a bee stung her?

"However, we must not let ourselves be deterred by the obstacles in our path," Emily continued, her voice wavering slightly. She tried to ignore the sensation in her arm, attributing it to adrenaline and nerves. "History has shown us time and time again that change is possible when we stand united in our convictions."

As she spoke, she noticed her vision beginning to blur at the edges, but she fought to focus on the faces of the passionate individuals who had come together for this cause. The crowd was hanging on her every word, their expressions resolute and determined. She couldn't falter now.

"Remember," Emily cautioned, her voice growing weaker, "it's not enough to simply demand transparency; we must also hold our elected leaders accountable for their actions. We cannot allow them to hide behind closed doors and make decisions that impact our lives without our input."

The dizziness she felt intensified, and her legs began to feel weak beneath her. Despite her determination to continue, Emily became disoriented, struggling to maintain her balance as the world swirled around her.

She pressed on, trying to hold onto her train of thought. "We...we have the power to shape our own futures, and we must use that power wisely. Let us stand together and fight for the transparency we deserve!"

Suddenly, unable to bear the weight of her own body any longer, Emily's legs gave out, and she crumpled to the stage floor. The microphone slipped from her grasp and clattered against the wooden platform, sending a wave of confusion rippling through the shocked crowd.

"Emily!" Ben cried out, rushing to her side. Concerned murmurs erupted among the audience.

"Is she okay?" someone else asked.

"Just a little light-headed," she said with a queasy smile.

Ben's face loomed over her. It was clear he wasn't buying her explanation.

"You need to finish the speech," she whispered to him. "We can't...lose this opportunity."

"Emily—" he started to protest, but she cut him off with a shake of her head.

"I'll be fine," she said, grabbing his arm and pulling herself to her feet. She turned to face the crowd. "Too much caffeine," she said loudly. There were a few relieved chuckles, though others continued to murmur, confused.

Emily stumbled off the stage. Ben made to follow her, but she waved him back, chastising him with her eyes.

"Go on," she mouthed, gesturing to the microphone.

Ben hesitated for a moment, then nodded. He picked up the microphone and cleared his throat before addressing the crowd. "As Emily was saying, we have the power to shape our own futures…"

Emily's vision swam as she stepped down from the stage and into the crowd. She tried to focus on putting one foot in front of the other, but each step felt heavier than the last. Her body wasn't responding the way it should, and an overwhelming sense of confusion engulfed her.

"Are you okay?" a concerned woman asked as Emily stumbled past her.

"Fine...just need some air," Emily managed, forcing a weak smile.

The woman didn't seem convinced but allowed her to continue. Emily pressed on, her strength rapidly fading, and the hum of Ben's voice grew fainter behind her. She needed to find a quiet place, somewhere to collect her thoughts and figure out what was happening to her.

A secluded alley caught her eye, mere steps away from the rally. The narrow passage offered a temporary refuge from the concerned stares and questions. As she entered, she leaned against the cold brick wall, fighting to stay conscious. The world seemed to spin around her, and her head throbbed with pain.

She couldn't make sense of it. Was it just nerves? Adrenaline? Or was it something more sinister? Emily struggled to think clearly, but her thoughts were muddled, elusive. She couldn't even remember what she had eaten for breakfast that morning.

"Get it together, Emily," she whispered to herself, taking deep breaths in an attempt to calm her racing heart. "You've got this." Then, without warning, Emily's chest tightened painfully. This couldn't simply be nerves or adrenaline; something was seriously wrong. She fumbled for her phone in her jeans pocket, determined to call for help. The cold metal of the device felt like a lifeline in her trembling hands.

"Come on, come on..." she muttered, trying to unlock the screen and dial 911. Her vision blurred, her fingers barely able to find the right buttons.

Please, don't fail me now, she thought, but her body betrayed her. Her legs gave out for a second time, and she collapsed to the ground, her phone slipping from her grasp.

In the distance, she could still hear Ben speaking into the microphone, his voice peppered with humor that elicited laughter from the crowd. They had no idea what was happening to Emily less than a hundred feet away.

"Help...please, someone help me," Emily whispered. But the sound was drowned by the cheers and laughter of the rally attendees. Darkness crept in at the edges of her vision, threatening to consume her entirely.

The last thing she saw before losing consciousness was the smiling faces of the crowd, their joy contrasting sharply with the terror gripping her heart.

And then she succumbed to the darkness. 

 

 

 

CHAPTER ONE
 

 

"Look, the Fourth Amendment clearly states that people have the right to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures," Dana said, warming to the argument by the second. "A warrantless search in this case would be an infringement upon that right."

The morning sun filtered through the blinds of the FBI headquarters, casting narrow beams of light across the room. Dana Blaze stood by a whiteboard covered in notes and annotations on constitutional law, her brown eyes flicking between her colleagues as they debated fiercely. The scent of fresh coffee mingled with the sharp tang of dry erase markers filled the air. She was only consulting on this case, but that didn't diminish her passion for the law in the slightest.

"Except when there's reasonable suspicion or probable cause," retorted one of her colleagues, a bespectacled agent named Mark. "We're dealing with a serial killer here. We can't afford to let them slip through our fingers over a technicality."

"Technicality?" Dana repeated, crossing her arms over her chest and arching an eyebrow. Her sinewy muscles tensed as she planted her feet firmly on the ground, ready to defend her point. "You might want to brush up on your constitutional history, Mark. The Founding Fathers didn't put these protections in place for kicks. They recognized the potential for abuse of power and sought to create a system of checks and balances."

As she spoke, she could almost feel her father's presence in the room, his deep-rooted beliefs about the sanctity of the Constitution instilled in her since childhood. He'd been a senator, a true servant of the people and a man who treated upholding the law as a high calling, never taking it for granted or using his position for his own ends.

Damn, how she missed him. She hoped he was proud of the woman she'd become.

Mark rolled his eyes, preparing another rebuttal, but was interrupted by the shrill ring of Dana's phone. She glanced at the display, recognizing the coded number as a signal of an urgent case. Her heart rate quickened, the debate momentarily forgotten.

"Sorry, folks, duty calls," she said, stepping away from the whiteboard and her colleagues' prying eyes. "We'll have to finish this debate another time." Her dark, wavy hair swayed as she moved, a few loose tendrils framing her face.

Dana paused at the door, her gaze lingering on Mark for a moment. "At the end of the day, Mark," she said, "it's your case. But a word of advice? Doing the right thing never came back to haunt anybody."

Mark rolled his eyes, looking unimpressed, but Dana didn't stay to hear his rebuttal. She didn't have time right now to debate hypotheticals—she was needed in the field.

Out in the hallway, Dana made her way to the office of her boss, Agent Gerry Michaels. She and Michaels had never gotten along particularly well. She sensed that her intellectualism threatened Michaels, who was an old school, blue-collar type who seemed to look down on anyone less senior than he was. Still, he was her boss, and she couldn't exactly go around avoiding him all the time.

Dana reached his office and knocked on the door. There was no response. She tried calling Michaels, but the call went to voicemail.

Where is he? she wondered. She considered heading to the gym for a Krav Maga session – it was one of her favorite ways of loosening up – but it felt irresponsible to do so now, with a new case looming. She wanted to get started, to hit the ground running. It wasn't her style to dilly-dally and take her time.

And yet, if Michaels wasn't in his office and wouldn't answer his phone…

Dana turned away from the door and started walking, hoping to find someone who might be able to help her locate her boss. As she did so, she found her mind wandering – as it often did when it had room to wander – to her father, who had been strangled to death eight years ago in a D.C. hotel, a crime the police had never solved.

Her father had been a prominent politician, and Dana remembered long evenings spent at the dinner table discussing the intricacies of constitutional law with him. His passion for justice and his deep respect for the U.S. Constitution had fueled her own intellectual curiosity and ultimately led her to join the FBI. In many ways, she was continuing his legacy by upholding the law.

Dana's mother, Aurora, was another story altogether. A successful journalist, she had always been more interested in chasing stories than nurturing family bonds, leading to frequent absences from the home that in turn fostered in Dana a sharp fear of abandonment. Dana had always felt herself tugged between her parents' personalities: one advocating duty and responsibility, the other advocating freedom and discovery.

Lost in these thoughts, Dana nearly missed the call. Her phone buzzed, and she quickly answered it, recognizing Agent Gerry Michaels' number.

"Blaze," she said, her voice all business.

"Agent Blaze," Michaels said, "I trust you've been notified about the case?" Dana couldn't help noticing the lack of a personal touch in Michaels' communications with her. There was no smalltalk, not even a question about how she was doing. That was just fine with her, though. She harbored no illusions about them ever becoming friends.

"I saw the message, yes," she said. "I was actually just at your office."

"Just got out of a meeting with the mayor," Michaels said, answering Dana's unspoken question. "He's very concerned—it's a bad look, these deaths."

Dana felt a stirring of unease. It wasn't often the mayor got involved in their investigations. Why had this case drawn his attention?

"What's the case about?" she asked.

Michaels cleared his throat. Dana could hear background noise, murmurs of passing conversation and the clipping of footsteps, as if Michaels were walking down a busy sidewalk.

"Two women in their early twenties," he said, "both of them political activists, have been found dead in Philadelphia, one a week ago and the other this morning. The manner of their deaths is suspicious, to say the least, and I need you to head there and investigate further."

"I'll make arrangements to head to Philadelphia immediately," she said.

"Good. I hope I don't have to stress how important this is. These were young women in the prime of their lives, pillars of their communities. There's going to be a wave of public outrage when someone connects the dots, which is why it's crucial we figure out what's going on as soon as possible—and bring any responsible parties to justice."

"Understood, sir."

"Good. Agent Harris is en route—he'll meet you there."

"Agent Harris?" Dana had heard the name, but she couldn't quite remember who he was.

"Sam Harris. I'm sure you've brushed elbows before. He's a Philly kid, born and raised, so he knows the terrain. I'm trusting you two to get this done."

"Of course, sir."

Sam Harris, she thought. She had a fleeting image of hazel eyes and a sharp, clean-shaven jawline. She had bumped into him once or twice, but they'd never worked together on a case before.

"Keep me informed of your progress, Agent Blaze," Michaels said. And with that, he hung up.

As Dana stared at her phone, her thoughts swirled around the case. Why were these women targeted? Was it politically motivated, or was there something more personal at play?

Whatever the case, Dana knew that time was of the essence. She hurried to her office to pack her gear for the trip to Philadelphia. As she zipped up her go-bag, Jake, a fellow agent who had often been her sparring partner, appeared in her doorway, holding a file.

"Hey," he said, extending the folder toward her. "Michaels wanted me to give you this."

"Just leave it on the desk there," Dana said, pointing. As curious as she was to read the file, she needed to focus on getting everything ready before her flight. She would have plenty of time to read about the case while in the air.

Jake hesitated, lingering.

"Is there something else?" Dana asked.

"It's just…" He paused. "Seems like the kind of case that can make or break your career, you know? I don't know the details, but I heard a few of the agents talking about it."

Dana nodded, unsure what to say.

"Well," Jake said, thrusting his hands into his pockets, "just be careful out there, okay? And I'm not just talking about your career."

Dana smiled and placed a hand on Jake's arm. "I'll be careful. No need to worry."

He grinned, looking relieved. "Good. Wouldn't want to lose my sparring partner."

"That would be a shame."

Jake retreated a few steps, then turned back. "Give 'em hell, Dana."

Dana smiled at him. "Always do."

With that, Jake disappeared, leaving Dana to finish packing.

With her bag packed and slung over her shoulder, Dana left the FBI headquarters, making her way to the airport. Once on board the plane, she settled into her seat and pulled out the file Jake had given her. It was time to delve deep into the case and mentally prepare herself for the investigation ahead.

As the plane took off from D.C., Dana flipped open the file and began absorbing every minute detail about the two victims and the circumstances surrounding their deaths. She learned that the first victim, Julia Bennett, had been a twenty-four-year-old social media strategist for a progressive political consultancy firm called Catalyst Consulting. She had been found dead a week ago, around eleven in the morning, while helping organize a large public event about free speech in Carronade Park in Philadelphia.

Dana frowned as she read through Julia's background. Was there a connection between the two victims beyond their activism? She made a mental note to investigate any possible links.

Her focus shifted back to the file, and she studied the details of Emily Haven's life.

Emily had been a twenty-six-year-old community organizer for a non-profit organization called Citizens for Social Justice, which focused on social justice causes. She had been found dead that very morning at a rally across from the Fifth Circuit Courthouse in downtown Philadelphia. The circumstances of both Emily's and Julia's deaths were suspicious, to say the least.

What made their deaths suspicious was not the presence of any damning physical evidence, but rather the lack of it. By all appearances, both women had simply fallen dead—which was particularly odd given that neither had any underlying health conditions that would make them susceptible to such an event.

Dana couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more at play here. She mulled over the information, her brow furrowed as she tried to make sense of it all. These women, both so young and passionate about their work, had become targets—but why?

And had they been killed by the same person? 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWO
 

 

Dana's mind was still clouded with questions as she arrived at the crime scene, a deserted alley behind a temporary stage made of plywood and scaffolding. The area had been cleared by the police, and the bright yellow crime scene tape fluttered in the wind. Across the street, Dana could see the white marble columns of Philadelphia's Fifth Circuit Courthouse, its bright and clean exterior a sharp contrast to the darkness of the dingy alley.

That's where justice is served, Dana thought. I don't know what happened here, but it sure wasn't justice.

Passing traffic slowed as drivers rubbernecked to see what was going on. As Dana got out of the car and approached the alley on foot, Sam Harris broke away from a conversation with a police officer wearing thick-rimmed glasses to meet Dana.

"Hell of a way to start a day, huh?" Sam asked, his striking hazel eyes looking green one moment, brown the next. At thirty-three, Sam was three years Dana's junior. He was, in many ways, Dana's opposite: street-smart where she was cerebral, pragmatic where she was idealistic, intuitive where she was analytical. Whether those differences would help or hinder them as a team, however, remained to be seen.

"Always is," Dana said, forcing a smile to mask her unease. "Good to see you, Sam. What have we got?"

"Emily Haven," Sam said, turning and nodding toward a body in the alley behind him, which was covered with a white sheet. "She was giving a speech on free speech when she suddenly felt faint, left the stage, and stumbled into this alley. Her friend, Ben Spears, took over for her, then found her about ten minutes later after he wrapped up the speech."

"Any witnesses?" Dana asked, her eyes scanning the scene for potential clues.

"Unfortunately, no," Sam replied. "Her last moments were spent alone in this alley."

Together, they moved closer to the body. As Sam lifted the sheet, Dana braced herself for what lay beneath. Emily's lifeless face stared back at them, her once-bright blue eyes now dull and vacant. Her blonde hair splayed around her head like a halo, framing her deathly pale complexion.

"Odd..." Dana murmured, her gaze sweeping over the body. "No signs of struggle, no injuries."

"Exactly," Sam said. "No bruises, no cuts, nothing."

As Dana studied the scene, her keen eyes caught a glimpse of something out of place—a phone, partially hidden beneath a discarded cardboard box. Its screen was cracked, and it lay in a small puddle of murky water near the wall. It seemed that nobody else had noticed it yet.

"Sam, look at this," she said, pointing to the phone. She pulled on a pair of gloves and carefully retrieved it from its hiding spot. "Could be Emily's."

"Nice catch," Sam said, leaning in for a closer look. "If it is, she might have been trying to call for help when she died."

Dana nodded. "We'll need to have the tech team analyze it for any recent activity."

Before they could discuss further, Dana heard a man clear his throat behind them. She turned around to see a tall, lean man with a mop of curly brown hair and an apprehensive expression.

"Ben, this is Agent Dana Blaze," Sam said. "We're just going over the scene now."

"Hey," Ben said, his voice shaky and his eyes darting uncomfortably toward Emily's body, then away again. "I just wanted to see if there was anything I could do to help. I feel so...useless, you know?"

"Actually, we were hoping you could tell us more about what happened during the rally," Dana said, rising. "We need to piece together Emily's final moments as best we can."

"Of course," Ben replied, swallowing hard. "Well, Emily was delivering her speech when she suddenly collapsed. She told me she was light-headed and said something about caffeine, but I..." He took a quick, anxious breath. "I knew better. I should've taken her to the hospital right then. But the show must go on, right?" His smile was clouded with bitter self-condemnation.

"What happened next?" Dana asked gently.

Ben shrugged, looking suddenly detached. "She insisted on leaving the stage, so I took over for her. We worked really hard to set this event up, and neither of us wanted to lose the opportunity. After I finished speaking, I came back here to check on her...and found her like this."

"Did you notice anything unusual during the event?" Sam asked, his brow furrowing. "Anything that might help us understand what happened?"

"Nothing really," Ben admitted, shaking his head. "The rally was going well, and Emily seemed fine up until the moment she collapsed. It all just happened so fast."

"Did she have any health concerns?" Dana asked. "Allergies, anything like that?"

"No, I don't think so. She was as healthy as a clam, as she liked to say. She got her idioms mixed up sometimes." He pressed his lips together in a sad smile.

"Did you notice any suspicious individuals in the crowd?" Sam asked. "Anyone you thought you needed to keep an eye on?"

Ben looked puzzled. "What are you asking? Are you suggesting someone…" He paused, as if he couldn't quite figure out how to frame what he was thinking.

"We don't know," Dana said gently. "We're considering all possibilities. This could have been some kind of accident…"

"Or what? Someone murdered her?"

Dana stared back, saying nothing. She watched as Ben's face, which had slowly transformed from shock to grief, now turned back to shock again.

"I didn't see anybody suspicious, no," he said in a quiet voice. "These were kind, well-intentioned people. True patriots."

"And she didn't have any enemies? Anyone who might've wanted to harm her?"

"Enemies? Sure, there were people who didn't like her political views, but to think someone would go as far as to harm her..." Ben trailed off, shaking his head again. "I can't imagine it."

"Thank you, Ben," Dana said, deciding they'd asked him enough questions. "We'll be in touch if we need anything else. In the meantime, try to get some rest."

"Sure thing," Ben replied, his eyes looking hollow. He forced a weak smile before retreating from the scene.

As Ben left, Sam turned to Dana. "I'm going to call someone about getting this phone examined. Maybe we'll find something useful on it."

"Good idea," Dana replied, watching him step away to make the call. She turned her attention back to Emily's body, feeling an intense need to uncover what had happened to the young activist.

Dana studied the body more closely, her eyes scanning every inch of exposed skin for any clues. As she carefully examined Emily's arm, she noticed something hidden underneath the sleeve. Gently lifting the fabric, Dana discovered a small puncture wound that was barely visible to the naked eye.

"Sam," she called out quietly, not wanting to disturb his phone conversation. He looked over at her, noticing the urgency in her gaze.

"Hold on a minute," he said into the phone. Then he cradled the phone against his shoulder and raised his eyebrows expectantly at Dana.

"Look at this," she said, pointing to the puncture wound. "What do you make of it?"

Sam studied the tiny mark, his expression growing serious. "It could be from a needle. A very fine one."

"I was thinking the same thing," Dana said. "If someone used a needle like this to inject poison rapidly into Emily's bloodstream, they could've killed her without anyone noticing. It would explain the lack of struggle and other physical injuries."

"An assassin hiding in plain sight during the rally?" Sam mused, looking troubled. "That's a chilling thought."

Dana nodded, growing thoughtful as she considered the possibilities. Anyone could've found out that Emily would be speaking here. But who had gotten close enough to prick her with a needle?

"Let me finish this call, and we'll go over everything we've found so far," Sam said, lifting his phone to his ear once more.

As Sam continued talking on the phone, Dana decided to search the alley once more. This time, she explored every inch of it, her eyes scrutinizing the ground for any overlooked clues. Toward the far end of the alley, she spotted an inconspicuous piece of parchment wedged between a trash can and the brick wall of a building.

Dana carefully retrieved the parchment, turning it over in her gloved hands. On it, written in a careful, cursive hand, was a collection of letters without any apparent meaning: "epghdfeforsdahtbomceiiernge."

Dana stared at the letters, trying to make sense of them. What did they mean? Anything? Or was it nonsense?

She pulled out her phone and, entering the letters into her phone, began moving them around, looking for patterns, her Ivy League intellect hard at work.

Then, suddenly, a word jumped out at her: "freedom." That left her with "pghfsdahtboceiiernge." Making an educated guess, she also eliminated "the," leaving her with "pghfsdabociiernge."

What does it mean? she wondered, stumped. She kept toying with the letters, moving around, searching for a way to make sense of what seemed to be completely nonsensical. Was she on the right track, or were "freedom" and "the" incorrect? How was she to know?

Behind her, she heard Sam pacing back and forth as he spoke with a lab technician about the phone. She felt a sudden urge to solve this puzzle before he joined her—it was in her nature to be competitive.

Thinking about where she was and what had happened here, she managed to extract another word: "speech." That left her with "gfdaboiirng," which was far more manageable. It only took her a few moments more to crack the rest and then piece it all together.

"'Abridging the freedom of speech,'" she said aloud.

"What are you talking about?" Sam asked as he joined her.

"Take a look at this," Dana said, holding out the parchment for him to see. "It's a quote from the First Amendment. It could be our killer's signature."

Sam studied the parchment. "How'd you crack this so quickly?"

She shrugged modestly. "Played a lot of Scrabble as a kid."

"The First Amendment," Sam murmured. "Can't be a coincidence that Emily Haven was talking about free speech." He shook his head, his hazel eyes narrowing in thought. "A signature—you know what this means, right?"

"It means," Dana said, "that our killer has an agenda. And he'll probably strike again." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER THREE
 

 

Dana sighed, staring through the cold glass of the morgue window and out into the hallway as she and Sam waited for the coroner to arrive to examine Emily Haven's body. She was still thinking about the parchment she'd found in the alley where Emily died, still wondering what its cryptic reference to the First Amendment could mean.

What is the killer telling us? she wondered.

"Dr. Wilson should be here any moment," Sam said, breaking the silence. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other. "Let's hope we're able to figure out more about that needle mark."

Dr. Gregory Wilson was the chief medical examiner in Philadelphia, and Dana had known him since her early days in the FBI. They'd worked together on several high-profile cases, and Dana respected his meticulous nature and expertise in forensic pathology. He was in his mid-fifties, with salt-and-pepper hair, and he wore round glasses that gave him an air of intelligence and approachability.

As if on cue, the doors opened. "Ah, Agent Blaze, Agent Harris," Dr. Wilson said, entering the room wearing blue scrubs and latex gloves. "Thank you for your patience. I was just finishing up another case."

Dana and Sam nodded in greeting.

"Let's get started then," Dr. Wilson said, approaching the examination table. "Time is of the essence in cases like this."

He pulled the sheet back from Emily's body and began to examine the needle mark on her arm. Dana watched intently, taking mental notes as Dr. Wilson worked.

"It appears to be a small-caliber needle, possibly a diabetic needle," he said after a few moments. "Visual examination won't tell us what substance was injected, but we'll run tests and hopefully have answers soon."

"But you're sure she was poisoned?" Sam asked.

"Hard to say anything for certain without the toxicology report," Dr. Wilson replied. "But given the rapid onset of symptoms and lack of visible injuries, it's the most likely scenario."

Dana frowned as she considered the implications of the poisoning. She turned to Sam. "Did Ben Spears mention anyone being on stage?" she asked. "Anyone who might've gotten close to Emily?"

Sam scratched thoughtfully at his chin. "Now that you mention it, he did say that she walked into the crowd to interview an attendee—a teenage girl."

"That's probably when the killer stuck her with the needle," Dana murmured. "I doubt anyone would have noticed in all that chaos, though."

"Dr. Wilson," Sam asked, "do you think there might be any DNA left on her body from the attacker?"

Dr. Wilson shook his head as he continued his inspection. "It's possible, but given the nature of a needle prick, it's doubtful. I'll still take swabs and send them through our lab just in case, of course."

"Any idea how long it might take for the toxicology report?" Dana asked.

"Unfortunately," Dr. Wilson said with a sigh, "it could be several days. We're backed up at the moment, and the tests themselves can be time-consuming. But I promise to get the results to you as soon as they're available."

"We really can't afford to wait," Dana said. "If these murders are indeed connected, we could be dealing with a serial killer, and there's no guarantee he won't strike again soon. The longer it takes to get those results—"

Dr. Wilson held up a hand. "I understand the urgency, I really do, and I'll be sure to pass that along. But ultimately, it's not just up to me. At the risk of sounding insensitive, there are many urgent cases, even if not all of them are as intriguing as this one."

Dana tried to contain her disappointment. She understood where he was coming from, however. They would just have to do the best they could with the information they had.

"Do you have any theories on what poison could've been used?" she asked, pivoting. "Something that acts so quickly must be pretty potent."

Dr. Wilson thought for a moment before answering. "There are several possibilities: cyanide, for example, is fast-acting and can cause a sudden loss of consciousness. Another possibility is tetrodotoxin, which is found in pufferfish venom. It's extremely potent and can lead to rapid paralysis and death. Of course, there are other options, but we won't know until the toxicology report comes in."

"Of course," Dana said. She paused, thinking. "What about Julia Bennett? Did she have a needle mark, too?"

Dr. Wilson nodded gravely. "Almost the same exact spot as Ms. Haven's, too."

Sam cursed softly. "There's no question, then. The murders have to be connected."

"Did you learn anything else from Julia's autopsy?" Dana asked the coroner.

He shook his head. "Nothing of relevance. No signs of struggle or self-defense, nothing unusual at all except the puncture wound on the arm."

Dana nodded, not particularly surprised. "Thank you for your help, Dr. Wilson," she said.

"Anytime, Agent Blaze." Dr. Wilson smiled politely.

With that, Dana and Sam took their leave, stepping out of the sterile examination room and into the wide hallway of the morgue. The faint hum of fluorescent lights accompanied their footsteps as they walked past rows of cold storage chambers, each containing a life that had met its untimely end. The somber atmosphere weighed heavily on Dana's mind as she replayed Dr. Wilson's words about the potential poisons.

As they exited the building, the late morning sun greeted them with a warmth that contrasted sharply with the chill of the morgue. The early autumn air was crisp, carrying the scent of fallen leaves and the distant sound of traffic. The sky was a brilliant blue, dotted with scattered clouds that seemed to drift lazily overhead.

"While we wait on Emily Haven's toxicology report," Sam said as they neared the unmarked SUV they were using while in Philadelphia, "why don't we take a closer look at Julia Bennett? I've got her file in the glove box."

"Sounds like a good idea," Dana said. "I feel like I hardly know a thing about her."

They entered the SUV, Dana sitting in the driver's seat while Sam sat across from her. Sam pulled a case file from the glove box and opened it up, his face taking on a studious cast as he cocked the file toward Dana so she could examine it with him.

Dana scanned the file, her eyes quickly sifting through the information. There were statements from Julia's friends and colleagues, as well as accounts from witnesses who had been at Carronade Park on the day she was killed.

"'According to her friends,'" Dana read aloud, "'Julia was passionate about advocating for social change. She was always involved in campaigns and took a keen interest in local politics.'" As Dana continued reading, she learned that Julia had worked as a social media strategist at Catalyst Consulting, using her skills to amplify political causes online.

"Here's something interesting," Sam pointed out, tapping a finger on the page. "Julia organized a protest at the Capitol last month, focusing on freedom of assembly."

"Freedom of assembly?" Dana asked, suddenly recalling the parchment they'd found near Emily Haven's body. "You don't think...is that the connection? Free speech and freedom of assembly?"

"You think the killer has a problem with the First Amendment?"

Dana nodded thoughtfully. "It's a possibility. Or it could be a twisted interpretation of it. We'll need to dig deeper into Julia's background and her involvement in those protests."

As she spoke, her eyes drifted toward a group of people gathered on the sidewalk. They were holding signs and chanting slogans, their voices carrying across the street.

Sam followed her gaze and frowned. "Looks like another protest. Wonder what it's about this time."

"Protests do have a way of fomenting violence," Dana murmured. "Is it possible the two women had some other political stance in common, something that put them at risk from a violent extremist group?"

"Maybe," Sam said, his eyes narrowing in thought. "You think the killer was part of a group?"

She shrugged. "I don't know what to think. I just don't want to assume anything. Let's keep digging—there could be more connections we're missing."

As she scanned the file again, Dana's eyes caught on a pattern. "Look at this," she said with a hint of excitement in her voice. "It appears both Emily and Julia were involved in organizing the events they were at when they were killed. They weren't just participating—they were leading from the front."

"Another connection?" Sam asked, leaning over to see what she'd found.

"Seems like it," Dana said, pointing at the details of the events. "Emily was holding the rally near the Fifth Circuit Courthouse, and Julia organized a protest at the Capitol last month. Both events required permission from the city board."

"Which city board?" Sam asked.

Dana made a quick search on her phone. "It's called the Philadelphia Public Assembly Board," she said. "Their purpose is to review and approve permits for public events, including protests and rallies."

"Alright, so both victims had to get permission from this board..." He rubbed his clean-shaven cheek. "What does that tell us?"

Dana looked up article after article, reading about the public events. Soon, she came across a report from a small local press.

"Here we go," Dana said, leaning forward with sudden interest. "According to this article, one of the board members, Martin Grimes, made several complaints against both Emily's and Julia's events."

"Martin Grimes, huh?" Sam said, pulling out his own phone. He tapped rapidly at the screen. "According to what I'm seeing, it appears he's a constitutional law professor at a local university. Has some...interesting political views."

"Interesting? How so?"

"For example, he's argued in favor of abolishing the Electoral College system altogether and replacing it with something he calls 'direct democracy.'"

"Wow," Dana mused, trying to imagine what that would look like. "Any other noteworthy stances?"

"He also thinks the Confederacy should've been allowed to exist," he said. "And that states should have the right to secede from the Union."

Dana raised an eyebrow. "So he's a bit of a controversial figure."

"That's certainly one way to put it," Sam said, scrolling through more articles. "Looks like he's been in the news quite a bit lately, giving interviews and op-eds on all sorts of issues. Had some pretty public disagreements with a few politicians and even some fellow professors."

"So, this Martin Grimes is anti-government and opposed both Emily's and Julia's events," Dana said, recapping what they'd learned so far. "I guess there's only one question left: Did he limit himself to words, or did he turn to violence to get his message across?" 

 

 

 

CHAPTER FOUR
 

 

"Are you sure Grimes is home?" Dana asked, her eyes scanning the mansion's dark windows for any sign of the professor.

She and Sam were sitting in their unmarked car, staking out Martin Grimes' residence: a looming Victorian mansion surrounded by overgrown ivy and shadows cast by towering trees. The late morning sun peeked through the thick canopy of leaves, casting a dappled light on the quiet street.

"According to the university secretary I spoke with, he canceled his classes today," Sam replied, keeping his gaze trained on the entrance. "She said Professor Grimes didn't give a reason—just that he wouldn't be in."

"Interesting," Dana mused, mulling over the possibilities. Why would Grimes suddenly not show up at Ironwood University, where he taught? Was it because he wanted to be at Emily Haven's rally that morning so he could murder her?

"Sam," she asked, turning to face him, "do we know where Grimes was a week ago when Julia Bennett was killed?"

"Unfortunately, no," Sam admitted with a sigh. "I tried talking to some colleagues and students, but nobody seemed to have a solid alibi for him. It's all hearsay and speculation."

Dana chewed her lip, considering the implications. As far as she could tell, Grimes had the motive and the opportunity to kill Emily Haven.

"We need to talk with him directly, see what he has to say for himself," Dana said. "I want to catch him off-guard, see how he reacts to seeing two FBI agents showing up on his doorstep."

"Well, it might be a bit late for that," Sam said, gesturing at the mansion. As Dana looked closely, she noticed a figure standing in the second-story window, gazing out at them. He raised a mug to his lips, sipped, and then turned and walked out of view.

Dana and Sam exchanged a glance before getting out of their vehicle. As they approached the house, Dana couldn't help but admire its grandeur. The mansion was nestled in a secluded area surrounded by tall, ancient trees that cast long shadows on the gravel path leading up to the entrance. The lawn was immaculate and vibrant, without a single dead leaf anywhere.

"Nice place," Sam muttered, his eyes scanning the surroundings as if searching for any hidden threat.

"Tells you a lot about the professor, doesn't it?" Dana asked, noting the ostentatious display of wealth and the air of mystery that seemed to cloak the property.

Upon reaching the door, Dana knocked firmly, listening for any movement inside. When there was no answer, she raised her hand to knock again, but Sam's voice overrode her.

"Professor Grimes, we know you're home!" he called out. "We just want to talk."

For a moment, there was silence. Then, Dana heard the sound of approaching footsteps. The door finally opened, and a man poked his head out. He was in his early sixties, with gray hair and sharp, calculating eyes framed by deep lines etched into his forehead—a testament to years of intense study and debate.

"Who are you, and what do you want?" he asked, clearly taken aback by their sudden visit. His gaze shifted between Dana and Sam, as if trying to discern their intentions.

"Professor Grimes, I'm Agent Dana Blaze and this is my partner, Agent Sam Harris," Dana said, flashing her FBI badge. "We'd like to speak with you about an urgent matter."

"What urgent matter?" he asked, his eyes narrowing.

"We're investigating the murders of Julia Bennett and Emily Haven," Sam said.

Grimes' eyes widened, but Dana saw no trace of fear in them. "Murder?" he asked. "Are those names supposed to mean something to me?"

"You're on the Philadelphia Public Assembly Board, is that correct?" Dana asked.

Grimes nodded warily. "Yes. Why?"

"Those two women my partner mentioned both requested permission from your board to hold public rallies, one this morning and another a week ago. According to what I've heard, you were the only one who opposed their request."

Grimes pursed his lips, his eyes flitting between Dana and Sam. "Yes, I remember now. I deemed their rallies to be a threat to public safety. I didn't want any incidents to occur."

"So it had nothing to do with disagreeing with their political beliefs?" Sam asked.

Grimes gave him a long, skeptical look. "Is that really why you're here? To discuss civics?"

Dana decided to head things off before this became a sparring match between the two men. "Professor Grimes, this would be a lot easier if we could come inside. We only need a few minutes of your time, and then you can go about your day."

The professor stared at Sam a few seconds longer, as if to drive home a point, before turning and retreating into the house, leaving the door open.

Dana and Sam exchanged glances before following Grimes into the mansion. The entryway was grand, with a high ceiling adorned with an ornate chandelier. Polished marble floors led to a sweeping staircase, and priceless artwork lined the walls. The opulence of the home spoke of both wealth and refined taste.

As they followed Grimes further into his home, it seemed he couldn't help but talk about the house. "This house belonged to my great-grandfather," he said, clearly proud of his heritage. "He made his fortune in the shipping industry. It's been passed down in our family ever since."

They entered a room well-suited for receiving guests. A large fireplace dominated one wall, its mantel displaying various antique trinkets. Plush armchairs and sofas were arranged around a coffee table adorned with books on history and constitutional law. The room exuded an air of intellectualism that seemed fitting for a professor like Grimes.

It would make sense that the killer would have an intellectual bent, Dana thought. A poisoned needle is a pretty sophisticated way to kill a person.

"Please, have a seat." Grimes gestured to the furniture, taking a seat himself, though he still appeared somewhat tense.

Dana noticed his unease and decided on a congenial approach. "I heard you teach at Ironwood University. Is that true?"

Grimes nodded, relaxing slightly. "Yes, I've been a professor there for over twenty years."

"Which subjects do you teach?" she asked.

"Constitutional law and political philosophy," he replied, the pride in his voice evident. "I like to think I'm helping to shape the minds of the next generation of leaders."

"That's a noble profession," Dana said with a smile. "Speaking of leadership, as a member of the Philadelphia Public Assembly Board, you must have a strong opinion on current events."

Grimes leaned forward, his eyes sparking with intensity. "Absolutely. I believe that the current administration is systematically dismantling the foundations of our democracy. We need to resist this erosion of our fundamental rights and values."

Sam raised an eyebrow at this. "If you're so passionate about shaping the minds of our future leaders, then why aren't you at Ironwood right now? Why'd you cancel classes today?"

Grimes shifted in his seat. "Well, I had some personal matters to attend to."

Dana caught Sam's eye, her instincts telling her that if they pushed Grimes too hard, they wouldn't get anything. Better to keep him calm and relaxed. She decided to steer the conversation toward safer ground, hoping to catch him off guard.

"I understand you have strong opinions about the First Amendment, Professor Grimes," she said. "Would you mind sharing your thoughts with us?"

Grimes straightened up, his eyes narrowing. "I believe the amendments to the Constitution are outdated. The government has grown too large, too controlling. They've encroached upon the freedoms they claim to protect."

Sam cocked his head, as if studying a particularly colorful insect. "But the First Amendment is all about protecting freedom of speech, religion, and the press, isn't it?"

"True," Grimes said, his voice growing more passionate. "But who enforces the First Amendment? The same government that seeks to control us. It's a paradox, you see. They grant us these freedoms only to restrict them when it suits their purposes."

Grimes' fingers twitched on the armrests of his chair, hinting at an undercurrent of emotion beneath his philosophical diatribe. Dana remembered something her mother once told her: people's hands often betrayed their true emotions. She decided it was time to draw him out into the open and see his true colors.

"Professor," she asked, "did you know Emily Haven personally?"

"Of course not," Grimes snapped, his hands withdrawing to his lap and clenching tightly together. "Why would I have a personal relationship with someone of her ilk?"

Sam leaned forward, scrutinizing Grimes with a piercing gaze. "It's just interesting that you didn't go into work today, Professor. Were you planning on attending Ms. Haven's rally, by any chance?"

"Absolutely not!" Grimes said, his face flushing crimson. "I took the day off to catch up on my research—a book I'm writing. I have no interest in attending those rallies."

"We're not accusing you of anything," Sam said in a mild tone. "You have to admit, though, that your absence from work is a little...curious, considering the circumstances."

Grimes' agitation continued to mount, his words spilling out more rapidly. "Fine! Yes, I went to Ms. Haven's rally, but it wasn't because I supported her. Quite the opposite—I wanted to publicly challenge her political stance."

"Did you get the chance to do so?" Dana asked, sensing they were finally getting somewhere.

Grimes shook his head, frustration etched in the lines around his mouth. "No. Before I could say anything, she collapsed on stage. After that, there was nothing left for me to do but leave."

Dana studied Grimes, her eyes narrowed in contemplation. The sunlight filtering through the window cast a golden hue across the room, highlighting the dust particles that danced in the air.

"Professor Grimes," she asked, "where were you last Wednesday, around nine a.m.?"

Grimes blinked at the sudden shift in questioning but composed himself quickly. "I was at a conference in Boston," he replied. "I gave a lecture on the erosion of civil liberties in America. There were hundreds of attendees, so if you need witnesses, I'm sure many of them would be able to vouch for my presence."

"How long were you in Boston?" Sam asked.

"The entire day," Grimes said. "I was there from Tuesday until Friday evening. You can check with the hotel and airline if you'd like to verify my claim."

As Dana processed this information, she felt a mix of relief and disappointment. Grimes seemed to have a solid alibi, and though it didn't completely absolve him of guilt, it certainly cast doubt on his involvement in Julia Bennett's death. She glanced at Sam, who appeared similarly conflicted.

"Thank you for your cooperation, Professor," Dana said, rising from her seat. "We appreciate your candor, and we'll be in touch if we have any further questions."

"Of course, Agent Blaze," Grimes replied, standing as well. "If there's anything else you need, don't hesitate to contact me."

Dana nodded, and she and Sam followed Grimes to the front door. As they stepped into the crisp autumn air, the scent of fallen leaves filled Dana's nostrils, and she took a deep breath and tried to clear her thoughts.

"Are we really just going to let him go?" Sam asked, sounding agitated as they walked down the front steps. "What about your theory of a group murder? Maybe Grimes killed Emily, and someone else – an associate of his – killed Julia."

Dana shook her head, the strands of her hair brushing against her face. "I don't believe that's the case, Sam. While Grimes may have strong opinions and a motive for wanting to silence Emily, he doesn't fit the profile I've been building in my mind."

"Which is?" Sam asked.

"Someone who's meticulous, methodical, and highly self-controlled," Dana said. "Grimes is passionate and impulsive. He would've confronted both victims directly, not resorted to underhanded tactics like poison."

Sam mulled over her words as they reached their vehicle. "So if not Grimes, then who?"

"That's the million dollar question," Dana murmured, opening the door of the SUV. "I think it's time we talk to someone who knew Emily. Maybe, just maybe, we can figure out if Emily was targeted for her political views—or if there's something else at work here." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER FIVE
 

 

Dana lifted the framed photograph, studying the faces of the two women intently. One was Emily Haven, her eyes bright and full of conviction, while the other woman resembled her so closely that they could have been mistaken for twins.

So young, Dana thought. Who could target such a person?

Claire, dabbing at her face with a tissue, noticed Dana's attention on the picture. "I'm just a year older than her," she said. "We did everything together when we were kids—thick as thieves, Dad used to say."

Dana nodded, smiling gently as she returned the photograph to the shelf. The apartment Claire had shared with her sister was modestly furnished, with an eclectic mix of colors and patterns reflecting the sisters' vibrant personalities. Family photos adorned the walls, and books on political theory and activism filled the shelves, testifying to the passion that had driven Emily in her short life.

Dana studied Claire, the woman's red-rimmed eyes a testament to the grief she was experiencing. Claire was taller than her sister, with long curly hair that framed her face in a halo of auburn curls. She was dressed in a loose-fitting sweater and jeans, her bare feet tucked beneath her on the couch where she sat.

I wish I could just let her grieve in peace, Dana thought wearily. But we need answers.

"Miss Haven," Dana began gently, "we need to understand more about Emily's life to help us find out who might have wanted to harm her." She paused, allowing Claire to absorb the meaning of the words. "Could you tell us about her interests, recent activities, anything that might give us some insight into her personality?"

Claire took a deep breath, steadying herself before speaking. "Emily was…she was passionate about everything she did. Her friends meant the world to her, and she would do anything to help them. She was involved in all sorts of community projects—organizing food drives, tutoring underprivileged kids, advocating for affordable housing." A small smile crossed her lips, a brief respite from her anguish. "She even convinced me to join her at a few events."

Dana nodded, making mental notes of the details.

Sam, quiet up until this point, picked up a small card apparently written by a child Emily had been supporting in South America. "What about her political work, Miss Haven?" he asked as he returned the card.

Claire wiped her eyes, determination filling her expression. "Politics was her lifeblood. It started in college when she joined the student government. After graduation, she became a community organizer for Citizens for Social Justice. She led campaigns for better education funding, healthcare reform, and clean energy initiatives. But most of all" – here Claire's voice rose in intensity – "she fought for government transparency. She believed that everyone had a right to know what their elected officials were doing so they could hold them accountable."

As Dana listened to Claire's description of Emily's political work, a new realization began to take hold. The fight for government transparency was not without its enemies—people in power who would do anything to protect their secrets. It seemed increasingly plausible that Emily's murder had been politically motivated.

Still, they couldn't rule out a more personal connection. It was possible there was another, more subtle link between Emily and Julia Bennett, and Dana wasn't about to leave any stones unturned.

"It sounds like your sister was an amazing person," Dana said. "Even the kindest people, though, can fall under criticism. Did she have any enemies that you know of? Anyone who might have held a grudge against her because of her work?"

Claire shook her head, her brow furrowing. "No, not that I can think of. She was so kind-hearted and always tried to understand people's perspectives, even if they didn't agree with her. Honestly, I don't think she had a malicious bone in her body."

Dana nodded, not really surprised. "And what about her dating life? Was she seeing anyone?"

Sam cleared his throat. "Sorry to interrupt, but do you mind if I use your bathroom?" His eyes met Dana's for a brief moment, and she had the distinct impression that he wasn't really interested in using the bathroom. He just wanted an excuse to poke around.

"Of course not, it's just down the hall," Claire said, gesturing. As Sam excused himself, Claire turned back to Dana. "To answer your question, no, Emily wasn't seeing anyone. She's been single for a while. Liked to say she didn't have the time or energy for a relationship, not with all her activism work. But she did have close friends within her organization, people who understood her passion and supported her in every way possible."

"And you're sure she would tell you about something like that?"

Claire smiled sadly. "Oh, yes. We told each other everything."

Dana nodded again. She decided to try another angle. "Was there anyone who disagreed with her publicly, maybe someone who made the disagreement personal?"

Claire shook her head. "Not that I know of. Emily was always respectful in her debates and never made things personal, and I think other people appreciated that and treated her the same way in kind."

Dana leaned back in her chair, thinking. It seemed like Emily was truly beloved by everyone she knew. But that didn't mean there wasn't someone out there who had a grudge against her.

The sound of a toilet flushing reached Dana's ears, followed by Sam's entrance back into the living room. He glanced at Dana, his eyes silently communicating to her that he'd found something of interest during his brief excursion. He offered a grateful smile to Claire.

"Thanks for letting me use your bathroom," he said.

"Of course," Claire replied, dabbing at her eyes with a tissue. The emotional weight of the conversation had clearly taken its toll on her.

"On my way back," Sam said, "I couldn't help noticing a bedroom down the hall that seemed like it might be Emily's. Would you mind if we took a quick look? It might help us understand her better and figure out who could have done this to her."

Claire hesitated, her eyes darting toward the hallway. She clearly didn't want to disturb her sister's belongings. Dana could see the internal struggle playing out on Claire's face.

"Please, Claire," Dana said, her voice soft and empathetic. "We'll be respectful, I promise. We just need any information we can get to help solve this case."

After a moment, Claire nodded, acquiescing to their request. "Okay. But, please, try not to move things around, okay? I want to keep everything the way she did, at least for now."

Dana smiled gently. "We understand. We'll be careful."

Claire led Dana and Sam down the narrow hallway, stopping in front of a plain wooden door. Claire paused, as if gathering her will. Then, with a deep breath, she pushed the door open.

The early afternoon sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a warm, golden glow upon the room. The walls were painted a soothing shade of lavender, and various framed photographs of family, friends, and political events decorated the space. A neatly made bed sat against one wall, adorned with an assortment of colorful throw pillows. A bookshelf, filled to capacity with political biographies, poetry collections, and yoga manuals, stood opposite the bed.

As Dana walked around the room, she took note of the details: a worn pair of running shoes by the door, a yoga mat rolled up in the corner, and an open notebook on a small wooden desk. It was clear that Emily had been passionate about her interests, and her dedication to her causes shone through in every aspect of her life.

"Emily was always very organized," Claire said, her voice cracking with emotion as she looked around the room. "She needed structure to balance her activism and personal life. She would often spend hours here, writing, researching, and planning her next move."

"Her dedication is evident," Dana said, scanning the book titles and pausing at a framed photograph of Emily speaking at a rally. The passion in Emily's eyes was undeniable.

"Did she have any routines or habits that you think might be relevant?" Sam asked, studying a cork bulletin board filled with postcards and event flyers.

Claire thought for a moment, then said, "Well, she did have a habit of going for long runs when she felt overwhelmed or stressed. It helped clear her mind. And she practiced yoga almost daily. Other than that, I can't think of anything specific."

Dana nodded, taking in the information. Every detail mattered, no matter how insignificant it might seem in the moment.

As they continued to explore the room, Dana's eye caught sight of a small leather-bound book on Emily's desk. A combination lock secured its pages from prying eyes.

"Did Emily keep a diary?" she asked, gesturing at the book.

"Yes, she journaled almost daily," Claire said with a nod. "She found writing therapeutic and believed it helped her process her thoughts and feelings."

"Would you happen to know the combination?" Sam asked.

Claire hesitated as she stared at the journal. "No, I don't. And, to be honest, I'm not sure if I should share my sister's private thoughts. Even if it might help the investigation, it just feels...wrong."

Dana understood Claire's reluctance, but they needed any information they could gather. "I understand your concern, and we respect Emily's privacy," she said. "However, there might be something in this journal that could lead us to her killer. Isn't that more important?"

Claire sighed, her shoulders slumping. "You're right," she said. "If there's any chance it could help, then we have to try."

Claire picked up the journal and began attempting various combinations, murmuring to herself as she did so. She tried significant dates, favorite numbers, and other meaningful sequences, but none of them seemed to work. Frustration crept into her expression as she shook her head. "I can't seem to figure it out."

"Think about any important events or symbols in Emily's life," Dana suggested, hoping to spark an idea for Claire. "What were her passions, her inspirations?"

Claire paused, deep in thought. Then, suddenly, her face brightened. "Of course!" she exclaimed, quickly dialing in a new combination and successfully unlocking the journal. "It's 1789, the year the U.S. Constitution was adopted. Emily was so passionate about constitutional rights—it makes perfect sense."

Dana couldn't help but feel a surge of admiration for Emily's devotion to her cause. She exchanged glances with Sam before they both turned their attention to the now-unlocked journal.

Dana picked up the journal and began leafing through the pages, taking note of the neat handwriting that filled them. Most of the entries were about political rallies, meeting different activists, and planning community events—all expected, given Emily's passion for social justice. As she scanned the writings, Dana could almost hear the fire in Emily's voice, but nothing seemed particularly relevant to their investigation.

"Does anything stand out to you?" Sam asked, his tone cautious as he leaned over Dana's shoulder to examine the journal himself.

"Most of it seems to be related to her activism," Dana replied, her finger tracing the ink on the page as she continued to read. "I'm not sure we'll find anything useful here."

Claire fidgeted, pacing across the carpeted floor. There was no sound but the turning pages and the distant hum of traffic outside the window. With each entry that proved fruitless, Dana couldn't help but feel a growing sense of frustration and doubt.

Just as she was beginning to lose hope, however, an entry from a month ago caught her eye. It described a strange figure Emily had noticed in the crowd while giving a speech at a rally. According to the journal, Emily had seen him multiple times before, always watching her intently. She'd run into him several times around town – at the grocery store, the park, and the library – and had completely changed her routine because of him, avoiding all three of those locations.

"Sam," Dana murmured, pointing at the passage. "How long might this guy have been watching her before he chose to carry out his plan?" 

 

 

 

CHAPTER SIX
 

 

The man leaned back in the seat of his silver Plymouth, listening to the muffled cheers and impassioned speech from the rally being held only a few hundred feet from where he was parked.

"Animals," he thought. "Like a bunch of monkeys at the freaking zoo."

He drew in a deep breath, savoring the taste of his slowly burning cigarette. He held the smoke in his lungs for a moment before exhaling, watching it dissipate into the chilly atmosphere. His eyes remained locked on the woman standing confidently on stage, her voice carrying over the crowd even at this distance. Her name was Petra Delgado, and she had been the object of his unwavering attention for some time now.

Even with the windows rolled up, some of Petra's words managed to reach the man's ears. "Freedom of speech is our most powerful weapon," she cried with impassioned zeal. "It's the very essence of our democracy!"

As the man stubbed out the remains of his cigarette on the dashboard, he couldn't help but chuckle at her naïveté. Carefully, he placed the extinguished butt into a mint tin nestled amongst countless others, a testament to the hours spent meticulously studying his target. He pulled another cigarette from the pack and lit it, the flame illuminating his face briefly before fading back into the shadows cast by the elm tree overhanging his car.

Petra Delgado had been under his watchful gaze for weeks. He had studied her patterns—where she ate, where she slept, and most importantly, her public appearances. His methodical approach allowed him to blend seamlessly into her life without arousing suspicion. He had followed her to events like this one, listening intently and taking mental notes, always staying just far enough away to avoid detection.

As Petra continued her speech, the man rolled down his window, allowing the crisp autumn air to fill his car. He listened to her words as they floated toward him on the breeze.

"Free speech is our birthright, and yet we find ourselves silenced by those in power," Petra said, gripping the microphone as if it were the Holy Grail. "But we will no longer stay quiet! We must stand together and fight for our rights, for our freedom!"

The man shook his head, scoffing at her idealism. Inwardly, he thought about how wrong and foolish she was. He couldn't understand why these people bought into what she was saying. It disgusted him—all of it. The fervor with which they clung to her every word, the adoration in their eyes as they gazed at her like a modern-day messiah.

"Change is coming, my friends!" Petra continued.

"You bet your ass it is," he thought. "Not the change you're thinking, though."

He took one last drag from his cigarette. Then, deciding he'd heard enough, he stubbed out the cigarette and added it to the tin. He reached into the pocket of his sports coat and felt the syringe nestled within. There was a cap on the needle so he wouldn't accidentally prick himself—a fatal mistake, that would be.

Satisfied everything was ready, he opened the door and stepped out onto the street.

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone streets of Philadelphia as the man surveyed his surroundings. The scent of roasted chestnuts wafted through the air, mingling with the distant sounds of laughter and conversation. A vendor hawked soft pretzels to eager passersby, while pigeons pecked at crumbs nearby.

The man took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill his lungs as he steeled himself for what was to come. Despite the festive atmosphere around him, he had a job to do—a mission that would not be deterred by sentimentality or distraction.

"Remember, my friends," Petra's voice rang out, amplified by the speakers surrounding the stage. "Freedom of speech is not just a right—it is a responsibility! We must use our voices to speak out against injustice, to hold those in power accountable!"

The crowd roared with approval, clapping and cheering as Petra continued her impassioned plea. The man felt his stomach churn at their enthusiasm. It was all so repulsive—their idealism, their naivete, even the sweat-induced stench that hung in the air like a heavy fog.

"Let us make our city a beacon of hope for the rest of the country!" Petra cried, waving a hand through the air with vigor. "Together, we can create change and build a brighter future for everyone!"

"Bravo!" the man called out, forcing a smile onto his face as he joined the throng of people. He clapped along with them, mimicking their enthusiasm, though inwardly seething with disgust. He kept his eyes locked on Petra as she stood tall on the stage, basking in the adoration of her misguided followers.

"And let us not forget those who have fought and died for our right to speak freely," Petra said, her tone solemn now. "Their sacrifices will never be forgotten, and it is our duty to continue their fight for freedom."

A reverent silence fell over the crowd, punctuated only by the occasional sniffle or clearing of a throat. The man took advantage of the quiet moment to inch closer to the stage, his movements slow and deliberate so as not to draw any unwanted attention.

"Thank you all for coming today," Petra said, her green eyes scanning the sea of faces before her. "Together, we are unstoppable. Let's make our voices heard!"

The crowd erupted into thunderous applause, their cheers reverberating through the square like a triumphant battle cry. The man, however, did not cheer. He simply stood there, his eyes fixed on Petra as the smile fell from his face.

"Thank you, thank you," Petra said, stepping down from the stage and into the throngs of her supporters. She shook hands, posed for photographs, and exchanged pleasantries with the people who had come to see her speak.

The man entered the queue of those waiting to speak with Petra. He could feel the sweat beginning to form on his brow as he shuffled forward, inch by inch. The rhythmic chatter of the crowd filled his ears, a cacophony of voices united in their support for Petra's cause. The man forced a grin onto his face as though he shared their enthusiasm. His heart, however, held nothing but contempt.

"Thank you so much for your kind words," Petra said to the woman in front of the man, clearly touched by the outpouring of support. She beamed at the woman before turning her attention to the man.

"Hello," she said warmly, extending her hand. "Thank you for coming today."

"Hi, Petra," the man replied, taking her hand and looking into her eyes. "I just wanted to say how much I appreciate everything you said up there. It's really inspiring."

"Thank you," Petra said with a practiced smile. That smile, however, faltered ever so slightly as the man held onto her hand for a moment too long. He made sure to maintain eye contact, watching her discomfort grow, reveling in it.

"Look into my eyes," he thought. "I want you to remember me when you're lying on the ground, your organs failing, your limbs twitching. I want you to know it was me."

"Thanks again," he said finally, releasing her hand.

"Of course," Petra replied, trying to regain her composure as she turned to greet the next person in line. Her eyes darted back to the man, suspicions stirred but not fully awakened.

As the man stepped aside, he furtively reached into his pocket, his fingers wrapping around the cool, slender syringe. With practiced ease, he flicked off the protective cap and allowed it to drop to the ground, unnoticed.

Seizing his opportunity, the man brushed past Petra as if making toward the street on the far side of her, feigning a stumble as he bumped into her. In that brief moment of contact, he covertly jabbed the syringe into her arm, injecting the deadly poison and sealing her fate. He quickly withdrew the needle, his movements fluid and inconspicuous.

Petra absently slapped at her arm, as if thinking a bug had bitten her.

"Sorry," the man murmured, avoiding eye contact as he backed away, his head lowered in faux embarrassment. He slipped the syringe back into his pocket, its unassuming form hidden from view once more.

The man's pulse began to slow as he put more distance between himself and the scene of his latest crime. With each step, he felt a growing sense of triumph mixed with lingering unease. He scanned the area for potential witnesses, his eyes catching sight of a trash receptacle up ahead.

"Excuse me," the man said, sidestepping a young couple engrossed in conversation. His voice was light and friendly, betraying none of the dark thoughts that swirled within him. He continued his careful march toward the trash can.

Reaching the receptacle, the man nonchalantly reached into it and retrieved a plastic bag, the action so natural it appeared as though he were merely discarding a piece of litter. Hidden from the view of others, he deftly wrapped the bag around the syringe. With a swift, practiced motion, he deposited the concealed weapon back into the depths of the trash, burying the evidence beneath layers of discarded rubbish.

As the man turned away from the trash can, he allowed a carefree whistle to escape his lips. He threaded his way through the crowd, his stride confident and unhurried. The scent of autumn leaves filled the air, mingling with the distant aroma of street food vendors who had set up shop to capitalize on the rally's attendees.

Finally reaching his nondescript car, the man slid behind the wheel and turned the key in the ignition, the engine purring to life. As he drove away, he cast a final glance toward the stage where Petra continued to speak with her supporters. She rubbed her arm, frowning in confusion or perhaps discomfort. A thrill of anticipation coursed through the man as he imagined the poison coursing through her veins.

"Only a matter of time," he whispered to himself. "Only a matter of time." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER SEVEN
 

 

Dana Blaze stepped into Carronade Park, memories of her father's political rallies flooding her mind as she scanned the now-empty space. A week had passed since Julia Bennett held her own passionate rally here, and Dana tried to imagine the park teeming with life and energy. She could almost hear the sound of Julia's voice resonating through the air, her words full of conviction as the crowd clapped and cheered in response.

"Hard to believe it was just a week ago," she muttered to herself.

Indeed, the park now felt like a ghost of its former self. The once-gleaming green grass seemed duller under a gray sky, littered with trash and remnants of the rally. Shattered bottles, crushed cans, and discarded papers were strewn about. Tall trees with leaves turning various shades of orange and red bordered the park's edges. A chill in the air hinted at winter's approach, and the gentle rustling of leaves provided an unsettling soundtrack.

"Here," Sam said, pointing to his phone screen, which displayed the crime scene photos. "The stage was set up near that cluster of bushes. The crowd gathered mainly on this side, closer to the street." He gestured toward a patch of trampled grass and scattered debris, remnants of the horde that had once filled the area. "Julia collapsed right there, by that lamppost."

Dana squinted at the spot, noting how ordinary it seemed—just a simple lamppost casting its weak glow upon a small patch of ground. She could almost envision Julia falling, the life slowly draining from her body while chaos erupted around her.

Sam continued, "An ambulance arrived within minutes, but it was too late. She was pronounced dead at the scene."

A gust of wind blew through the park, sending a shiver down Dana's spine. She shook off the grim imagery and refocused on their task. Mentally comparing these surroundings to the setting where Emily Haven was killed, she began searching for anything that might tell them more about the killer.

"Let's expand our search," she said, her gaze sweeping over the park. "Check the areas surrounding the stage and the crowd."

"What are we looking for?" Sam asked.

She shook her head, her lips pressed tightly together. "Anything."

As Dana walked, she took note of the park's features: the winding pathways, clusters of benches, and a small playground tucked away in a corner, now devoid of laughter and play. She moved methodically, her eyes scanning every inch for potential evidence.

She spotted a trash can and, donning a pair of latex gloves, she began pawing through it.

"Hey, Dana, come look at this!" Sam called out from a distance.

Leaving the trash can, Dana hurried over to where Sam was standing by an old oak tree with gnarled branches that stretched high above them. As she neared Sam, Dana noticed his focus was on a series of letters carved into the tree trunk: "ysbaemaeapeebostlcl." The carving looked recent, the wood beneath the bark still fresh and pale, contrasting starkly with the dark outer layer.

"Another coded message?" Dana asked, eyebrows furrowing in concentration as she studied the enigmatic sequence.

"Looks like it," Sam said, watching her closely, knowing full well the way her mind worked when confronted with a challenge. "Any ideas?"

Dana's mind raced back to Emily Haven's case, recalling the parchment she'd found near the young activist's body. After unscrambling the letters, she had discovered a quote from the First Amendment:  She focused on the letters in front of her, wondering what the killer might be communicating this time.

"Give me a moment," she murmured, mentally rearranging the letters. Her eyes widened as she suddenly realized the message.

"Peaceably to assemble," she said, looking up at Sam. "It's another First Amendment quote."

"Two victims connected by political activism and First Amendment quotes..." Sam trailed off, letting the implications hang in the air.

Dana felt a shiver of excitement mixed with dread. "The killer is trying to send us a message. He's targeting activists and leaving First Amendment quotes behind. But why? What is he trying to achieve?"

"Maybe it's his way of challenging the system," Sam suggested.

"Or perhaps it's something more personal," Dana added, musing over the two quotes.

Sam took a few pictures of the carving, then returned his phone to his pocket. "Look, we're not getting anywhere with these coded messages alone," he said. "We need to speak with someone who knew Julia. Maybe they can provide some insight into her life and why she was targeted."

"Probably a good idea," Dana said. "Because whatever message the killer is sending, we'd better crack it quick—before anyone else gets hurt."

 

*   *   *

 

Dana watched the older woman playing with the toddler in the fenced-off yard, her gray hair pinned up in a loose bun. The woman wore a floral dress that had seen better days, its colors muted by countless washings. Despite her age, there was a certain grace to her movements as she helped the little boy balance on one foot, her hands hovering just above his waist.

"Looks like that's Cherish Bennett," Sam murmured, consulting his phone. "Julia's grandmother. According to the website, she's been running this daycare for almost a decade now."

The small playground outside the modest house buzzed with the energy of children, their laughter and shouts filling the air. It was an enclave of joy amidst the quiet suburban neighborhood. A wooden fence enclosed the area, ensuring the safety of the little ones as they played under the watchful eye of their caretakers. Swings creaked in rhythm, and the slide gleamed under the early autumn sun.

Dana observed the scene from a distance, her gaze lingering on Cherish Bennett, who was now speaking to another woman in an apron. This was 'Cherished Moments,' the daycare run by Julia Bennett's grandmother.

"Looks like a happy place," Sam said.

Cherish noticed them watching and handed the toddler a colorful toy car before making her way toward Dana and Sam. Her eyes were warm but guarded, a protective instinct emanating from her every step. "Can I help you?" she asked.

"Mrs. Bennett, I'm Agent Dana Blaze, and this is my partner, Agent Sam Harris. We're with the FBI." Dana displayed her badge. "We'd like to ask you a few questions about your granddaughter, Julia."

Cherish's eyes clouded with sadness at the mention of Julia's name, and she swallowed hard before responding. "Of course. What do you need to know?"

Dana studied Cherish's face, noting the lines etched by time and sorrow. She could see the resemblance between her and Julia. The afternoon sun, only a few hours from setting, cast a warm glow on the playground as leaves drifted lazily from the trees, scattering in shades of orange and gold.

"Were you and Julia close?" she asked.

"Julia was like my own child," Cherish said, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Her mother was always so busy with work, so I took care of her most of the time." She smiled, a nostalgic glimmer in her eyes. "We used to bake cookies every Sunday. It was our little tradition. Julia loved trying out new recipes, and we'd spend hours in the kitchen laughing and making a mess." Her gaze shifted back to the children playing, watching over them protectively.

"Did she have any interests or hobbies that stood out?" Sam asked.

"Besides baking," Cherish continued, "she loved reading—politics, history, you name it. She also volunteered at a local animal shelter. She had such a big heart."

"Was Julia dating anyone?" Dana asked, hoping to gain insight into her personal life.

"Off and on," Cherish admitted. "She had a few boyfriends over the years, but nothing serious. She was so focused on her career and making a difference in the world, she didn't want anything to hold her back."

Dana tried to imagine Julia's life, full of passion and purpose, now tragically cut short. She needed to find the connection, the reason behind her murder.

"Can you tell us about Julia's friends?" Dana asked. "Were any of them involved in politics or activism like her?"

"Most of her friends shared her interests," Cherish said, her eyes scanning the playground as a child's laughter rang out. "They met through college or work. They all cared deeply about social causes."

"Did Julia have any enemies?" Sam asked.

Cherish shook her head. "No, I don't think so," she replied. "She was passionate about her causes, but she never went out of her way to make enemies. If anything, people admired her dedication and willingness to stand up for what she believed in."

As they spoke, Dana watched the same toddler she'd noticed before wobble unsteadily across the playground. The little boy tripped over a protruding tree root and fell. He let out a piercing wail, tears streaming down his flushed cheeks as he clutched at his injured leg.

"Excuse me," Cherish said, her voice full of concern as she hurried over to the crying child. She scooped him up into her arms, soothing him with gentle words. "We'd better head inside and take care of this."

Dana and Sam followed Cherish through a side door that led from the playground into the cozy living area of the house. The walls were adorned with family photos and children's artwork, creating a warm atmosphere. A well-worn couch sat opposite a sturdy wooden coffee table littered with toys and books.

Cherish settled the boy on the couch and carefully rolled up his pant leg, revealing the skinned knee. She moved with practiced ease, wetting a soft cloth in a nearby sink and dabbing at the wound to clean it.

"You're as brave as Batman," she said, causing the boy's face to brighten suddenly.

"Really?" the boy asked with wide-eyed wonder.

Cherish nodded, smiling as she applied an antibiotic ointment and covered it with a colorful bandage featuring cartoon characters. "You sure are. But even Batman gets thirsty, doesn't he?" She handed the boy a juice box, which he cradled in both hands as he drank.

Dana glanced around the room as she pondered their next line of inquiry. She noticed the care that Cherish had shown in creating a loving environment for the children, from the soft rugs on the floor to the cheerful curtains that filtered the sunlight streaming through the windows. It was evident that this woman had dedicated her life to nurturing others, just as she had nurtured Julia.

Dana's eyes landed on a collage of photo frames adorning one wall, and she found herself drawn to them. The pictures documented various moments in Julia's life—family gatherings, vacations, and college events, each snapshot capturing her bright smile.

One particular photo caught Dana's attention. It depicted Julia during a heated debate with a young man in his twenties. He was tall and lean, with a mop of curly dark hair that seemed to have a life of its own. His eyes were intense, narrowed in concentration, his hands gripping the podium like vises.

"Cherish," Dana began, unable to keep the curiosity from her voice, "who is this man debating with Julia?"

"Ah, that's Todd Eichmann," Cherish replied, glancing over at the photo with a faint frown. "They had a public debate some months ago about the role of social media in political movements. Julia argued that social media could be a powerful tool for change, while Todd believed it was ultimately more harmful than helpful. They disagreed quite passionately."

Dana studied the photo more closely, noting the tension between the two figures. It was clear that their argument had been anything but friendly. She turned back to Cherish, noticing the hesitation in the older woman's demeanor.

"Is there something you're not telling us?" Dana asked, sensing that Cherish was holding back important information.

Cherish hesitated for a moment longer before sighing and nodding. "Well, yes. You see, the debate took a turn for the worse when Todd started making personal attacks on Julia. It was uncalled for, and I could tell it deeply hurt her. She tried to brush it off, but I know my granddaughter—she was affected."

"Then why did she have it framed?" Dana asked.

"She didn't. The picture was sent anonymously—by Todd, I would guess. Probably to rub salt in the wound. I wanted to get rid of it, but Julia said no, she wanted to keep it. I think it was her way of showing Todd had no power over her."

Dana exchanged a glance with Sam, who raised an eyebrow in silent agreement.

"Thank you for speaking with us, Ms. Bennett," Dana said. She pulled out a business card and passed it to the older woman. "Let us know if you think of anything else."

"Of course. Please…just find out what happened to my granddaughter. She didn't deserve this." The older woman's gaze was firm, but there was a slight tremble to her mouth.

"We will, ma'am," Sam said. "We will."

With that, Dana and Sam made their way out.

As they headed back to the street, Sam lagged a few paces behind, engrossed in his phone.

"Looking up Eichmann's address?" Dana asked.

"I was, yeah." Sam trailed off.

Dana, sensing he'd found something, stopped walking and turned toward. "Go on, spill the beans," she said.

"Looks like Eichmann was active on social media," Sam said. "And vocal, too. Got into a number of heated political arguments. Want to guess the name of one of the people he argued with most?"

Dana paused, thinking about it. Then it hit her. "Emily Haven," she said.

Sam nodded, a knowing look in his eyes. "Winner winner, chicken dinner." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER EIGHT
 

 

Dana rapped her knuckles against the weathered wooden door for the second time.

Come on, she thought impatiently. Where are you?

Her brow furrowed as she impatiently tapped her foot on the porch steps, waiting for a response that never came. She leaned in to peer through the window, cupping her hands around her face to block the sunlight. The house was shrouded in darkness, offering no clues to its occupant's whereabouts.

"He's gotta be home," Sam said, gesturing toward an old sedan parked haphazardly near the garage, its tired paint chipping away. "Someone must be home, anyway."

They were standing in front of Todd Eichmann's residence, a crumbling A-frame on the outskirts of Philadelphia. Once a grand home, it now seemed to be succumbing to the weight of time, its once vibrant colors faded and peeling. The lawn was unkempt, overgrown weeds snaking their way across the property, a testament to the owner's reclusive nature.

Just as Dana was about to knock on the door for the third time, she heard a voice call out from behind them. She turned her head and saw a middle-aged man, slightly balding with a graying beard, leaning over a wooden fence that separated Eichmann's house from his neighbor's. His eyes were a piercing blue that seemed to hold a mixture of curiosity and concern.

"Hey there," he called out, waving a hand in their direction. "You folks looking for Todd?"

Sam shot Dana a quick glance before answering, "Yeah, we're just trying to have a word with him."

"Is he in some sort of trouble?"

"No trouble," Sam said with a disarming smile. "Just need to speak with him about an acquaintance of his. Is he home?"

"Yes, I imagine so." The neighbor paused and looked around, as if to ensure no one else was listening. Then he lowered his voice. "Might not be easy getting him to come out, though. He's become quite a recluse. Doesn't talk much to anyone, not even to me, and we used to be close."

Dana was intrigued. "Do you know what changed?"

The neighbor sighed, running a hand through his thinning hair. "Honestly, I'm not sure. He's always been a bit eccentric, but it's gotten worse over the past few months. He's become increasingly paranoid, jumping at shadows and the like."

"Do you think you could get him to talk to us?" Sam asked.

The neighbor made a regretful face, his eyes full of sympathy. "I doubt it. The last time I tried to speak with him, he practically slammed the door in my face."

Dana nodded, doing her best to hide her disappointment.

The man glanced at his watch and suddenly frowned. "Look, I'm sorry, but I have to run. My wife's got a doctor's appointment, and I promised her I'd be there." He gave them a final nod before disappearing back into his yard.

"Thanks, anyway!" Sam called, then dropped the smile and shook his head. "That wasn't much help, was it?"

Dana studied the worn façade of Eichmann's house, the peeling paint revealing an even older layer beneath. "We need a new approach," she said. "Banging on the door clearly isn't working. Do you have any other ideas?"

Sam shrugged. "Kick down the door? Claim we smelled smoke?"

A sudden idea struck Dana. "Worth a shot," she muttered to herself. Pulling out her badge, she raised it in front of one of the windows. "Todd Eichmann," she said loudly, "we're with the FBI. We know you're home."

At first nothing happened. Then Dana heard the sound of movement from within the house. The door creaked open a few inches, revealing a suspicious pair of eyes peering out at them from beneath a mop of unkempt hair. Todd Eichmann looked older than his thirty years, haggard and pale, with an air of wary anxiety about him.

"What do you want?" he demanded, his voice tight and slightly hoarse. "Why are you here?"

Dana studied Eichmann's face as she asked, "Mr. Eichmann, is it?"

"Why does the FBI want to know?"

"We understand that you had a debate with Julia Bennett not long before her death. We'd like to speak with you about it."

Eichmann shifted uncomfortably, his gaze darting between Dana and Sam like a cornered animal. His bony fingers tugged at the frayed cuffs of his flannel shirt. "It was nothing," he muttered, still holding the door partially closed. "Just a discussion about politics."

"Really?" Dana asked, her keen eyes picking up on the minute ticks in his expression and posture. "Our sources mentioned that you made it personal."

"I don't know who your sources are," Eichmann said, his eyes narrowing, "but they're clearly misinformed. I never attacked her personally. We disagreed, sure, but that's what debates are for."

"How did the debate go, as best you remember it?" Sam asked.

Eichmann's jaw clenched, and he took a deep breath before saying, "Look, I don't have to answer any more of your questions. I want you both off my property, now." With that, he started to close the door.

"Wait," Sam said, sticking his shoe into the gap to stop the door from closing. Eichmann looked down, then glared into Sam's eyes.

"Get your foot out of my house," he said, his eyes burning with anger.

"You might want to reconsider, Mr. Eichmann," Sam said mildly. "After all, being a person of interest in a double homicide investigation isn't exactly a way to avoid attention."

Eichmann looked startled. "What are you talking about?"

Sam took a deep breath with an air of reluctance, as if hating to share a piece of bad news. "This can go one of two ways, as I see it. Either we can clear things up quickly and go on our way, or you can make this difficult by refusing to talk. Then you'll continue to be a person of interest, and it's only a matter of time before a nosy journalist finds out—I'm sure you can imagine how persistent they can be." He shook his head sadly. "Before you know it, your front lawn will be a media circus. You'll have news vans watching your every move, reporters hounding you for interviews, and your life will be an open book. Is that what you want?"

Eichmann's face paled, and he hesitated for a long moment before finally sighing and stepping back from the door. "Fine," he said tightly. "Come in."

Dana and Sam exchanged a quick look before following Eichmann into the dimly lit interior of the house. The air was thick with the smell of stale cigarette smoke and mildew, and Dana wrinkled her nose in distaste. Eichmann led them into a small living room cluttered with old newspapers, takeout containers, and empty beer cans. He gestured for them to take a seat on a lumpy couch before perching on an armchair across from them.

"Okay," he said, his gaze darting nervously between them. "What do you want to know?"

Dana took out a small notebook and pen, her eyes never leaving Eichmann's face. "Let's start with the debate you had with Julia Bennett. What was it about?"

"It was about politics," Eichmann said shortly.

Dana raised an eyebrow. "That's it? You didn't argue about anything in particular?"

Eichmann shifted in his seat. "We talked about a lot of things—the Constitution, mainly. She was a big supporter of the document, while I thought it could use some...changes."

"What kind of changes?" Sam asked.

Eichmann hesitated, looking uncomfortable. "Nothing drastic," he said finally. "Just some amendments to reflect the current state of our society. Like gun control laws, for example."

"And how did Julia respond to your proposals?" Dana asked.

"She didn't agree with me, of course," Eichmann said with a bitter laugh. "She was always so...righteous. Thought she knew what was best for everyone."

"What do you mean?" Sam asked.

Eichmann shrugged. "I don't know. She just had this way of talking down to people, like she was better than them. It got on my nerves, to be honest."

Dana made another note in her book. "And did your conversation turn heated?"

Eichmann hesitated again before nodding. "Yeah, I guess you could say that. We raised our voices a bit. But it wasn't anything serious—just a disagreement."

"Then why did you send her the photograph?" Sam asked.

"It was supposed to be a peace offering, you know? A way to smooth things over. I would have delivered it in person, but I was in a rush, so I left it in a box on the front step."

"And did you ever see her again after the debate?" Dana asked.

Eichmann shook his head. "Nope. That was the last time we spoke." He leaned forward, his eyes intent. "I know she was murdered, and I'm guessing from what you said about a 'double homicide' that you're here because there was a second murder. Am I right?"

Neither agent said a word. Eichmann, however, seemed to take their silence as confirmation. He leaned back, rubbing his chin nervously.

"I didn't kill her," he said in a flat voice.

"Where were you that day, since you bring it up?" Sam asked. "Last Wednesday morning, I mean."

"I was...I was at home," he said, his voice wavering slightly. "I had a deadline for a project I was working on, so I didn't leave the house all day."

"What were you working on?" Dana asked.

"I'm a technical writer," Eichmann said with a shrug. "Just some dry software manuals. Nothing exciting."

"And you were here all morning?" Sam asked.

Eichmann nodded. "My activity is tracked—every click of the mouse, every key I type. You can ask my boss about it."

"We'll do that."

Dana exchanged a glance with Sam and nodded, satisfied with Eichmann's alibi for Julia's murder, at least until they had time to investigate it. She decided to probe further, however, wanting to leave no stone unturned.

"We noticed you seem very active on social media," Dana said. "There was one person in particular, a woman named Emily Haven, whom you seemed to have a number of…conversations with."

"Heated conversations," Sam added.

"And?" Eichmann asked, looking puzzled.

"Did you know her personally?" Dana asked. "Ever meet her, talk with her face-to-face?"

Eichmann shook his head. "I don't even recognize the name, but I believe you if you say it. That's the nature of social media, isn't it? You spend half your time talking to a bunch of people you'd never even exchange two words with in person?"

"Where were you this morning, Mr. Eichmann?"

Eichmann sighed, as if weary of all the questioning. "I was at the doctor's office for a check-up. You can call them if you want. They'll have records of my appointment."

"Thank you, Mr. Eichmann," Dana said, making a mental note to verify his alibi later. Then she paused, thinking. "Before we go, may I ask why you don't like to go out much? Your neighbor mentioned you've become a bit of a...recluse."

Eichmann shifted uncomfortably, his gaze flicking down to his shoes as if contemplating whether or not to divulge such personal information. Finally, he let out a sigh and spoke. "I...I've always had a fear of open spaces and crowds. I've just managed to overcome it sometimes. Recently, though, my mother passed away, and with the onset of depression..."

He shook his head and closed his eyes tight. "The point is, I'm doing my best to manage it. But it's a work in progress."

Dana nodded, studying him closely. She had the impression he was telling the truth.

"Alright, Mr. Eichmann," she said. "I think we're done here. Thank you for your time."

Eichmann nodded, looking relieved. "Sure. And...I hope you catch whoever did this," he added, his voice softening.

Dana and Sam stood up, nodding before making their way to the door. As they stepped out into the cool air of an early evening, Dana breathed a sigh of disappointment.

"Well, that was a bust," she said, shaking her head.

"You never know," Sam said mildly. "Could be he's telling the truth about not seeing Julia again. Or maybe he's hiding something."

Dana snorted. "Everyone's hiding something, Sam. It's just a matter of whether or not we can find out what it is." She glanced back at the house as they started back to their car. "But I have a feeling our guy isn't Todd Eichmann. The killer we're looking for was able to blend in with the crowd at the debate—practically invisible, hiding in plain sight. Doesn't sound like the man we just met."

"Unfortunately, I agree," Sam said, his eyes cutting up the street, which was growing darker by the moment as the sun disappeared behind the trees in a blaze of orange. "I'm beginning to suspect our killer is a chameleon." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER NINE




"'Night," Dana said, waving a hand to Sam as he moved off down the hotel hallway, dragging his suitcase behind him. She turned her attention to her own door.

Home sweet home, she thought ironically.

As Dana slipped into the room and closed the door behind her, she breathed a sigh of relief. Her muscles ached, and she felt the fatigue settling deep into her bones. It had been a long day, and all she wanted was a chance to relax and unwind.

After dropping her duffel bag by the foot of the bed, Dana took in the hotel room around her. It was a standard room, nothing fancy, but it had everything she needed. A queen-sized bed with crisp white linens sat against one wall, flanked by two nightstands holding lamps with warm yellow light. A small desk, equipped with a phone and notepad, stood beside the window, which offered a view of the cityscape outside. Across from the bed, an old television sat atop a wooden dresser, probably filled with pay-per-view movies she wouldn't bother watching.

Dana walked over to the mini-fridge concealed within the dresser, hoping for a snack or a cold drink. As she searched through its contents, her thoughts drifted back to the many trips she'd taken with her father when he was campaigning to be a senator. She remembered staying in hotels just like this one, always feeling a sense of comfort and familiarity in their predictable layouts and amenities.

He was murdered in a hotel just like this one, too, a dark voice in her mind whispered. She shook her head, trying to banish the thought.

With a bottle of water in hand, Dana sank into the small armchair by the window, her gaze fixed on the twinkling lights of Philadelphia's skyline. As she watched the world outside her window, Dana thought about how her father had nurtured her intellect and critical thinking skills during those long hours on the road, instilling in her a deep respect for the U.S. Constitution. Despite their ups and downs, he'd always been a guiding force in her life, shaping her into the formidable woman and FBI agent she was today.

Those memories were bittersweet, tainted by the knowledge that her father was gone and that her relationship with her mother, Aurora, remained strained. The two women clashed often, their strong personalities and differing opinions making it difficult to find common ground. But even in the face of their disagreements, Dana couldn't help yearning for some sort of connection with her mother—especially in moments like this, when she felt so alone and weighed down by the burdens of her job.

You're thinking too much, she chided herself. You should be relaxing.

She pulled out her phone and navigated to a favorite playlist. Classical music always helped her unwind.

As the mellow strains of a Beethoven piano concerto filled the hotel room, Dana felt her tense muscles begin to relax. She opened her duffel bag, pulling out a pair of shorts and a soft cotton shirt that would be comfortable enough for a night's sleep. As she rummaged through her belongings, her fingers brushed against something unexpected—an old, beat-up case file that she recognized instantly.

The worn edges and creased corners spoke of the countless times she had gone through the pages, revisiting the details of her father's murder. Dana hesitated, feeling her heart constrict at the thought of reopening those wounds.

Forget about it, she told herself. Now's not the time.

She shoved the case file aside and quickly dressed. Then, pausing her music, she reached for the remote control on the nightstand. The TV flickered to life, illuminating the room with its artificial glow. Dana flipped through the channels, hoping to stumble upon something that could occupy her mind for a while.

"Breaking news" flashed across the screen, but the scene was all too familiar: another violent crime, more suffering. Dana's jaw clenched as she continued to search, stopping briefly at a nature documentary before deciding that images of predators stalking their prey wouldn't help her mood either.

A sitcom caught her eye, and she smirked at the absurdity of the characters' antics. For a moment, she allowed herself to get lost in their world, one where problems were always resolved within half an hour. But the laughter felt hollow. She was far too aware of the stark contrast between their lives and her own, a world where answers rarely came easily and happiness seemed perpetually out of reach.

Frustrated, she turned off the TV and tossed the remote onto the bed. It was clear that no form of escapism would provide the solace she sought.

With the TV now off, Dana lay back on the crisp hotel sheets, her mind speeding up despite the exhaustion creeping through her body. She closed her eyes, seeking the solace of sleep, but images of her father's murder haunted her thoughts.

Why had she chosen to stay at a hotel? It was as if she were inviting these memories to torment her. An Airbnb would have been a better choice, somewhere that didn't remind her so much of her father.

Her phone sat on the nightstand, its screen dark and silent. She reached for it, hoping someone might have messaged her – a friend, or even her mother – but there were no notifications. A pang of loneliness shot through her chest.

"Enough," Dana whispered to herself, determination creasing her brow. If sleep wouldn't come, then she would confront her demons head-on. She swung her legs over the edge of the bed and grabbed the case file from her bag, sitting down in the room's lone armchair. The worn cover felt heavy in her hands, as if each page bore an additional burden of grief and unanswered questions.

As she began to leaf through the file, Dana's fingers hesitated over the sleeve containing the most disturbing photos: images of her father's lifeless body, sprawled across the hotel floor.

She'd seen them before, but tonight she decided against pulling them out. She didn't need to see his broken form to remember; the pain was etched permanently in her heart.

Instead, Dana focused on the other crime scene photographs—the angles of the room, the placement of furniture, any overlooked detail that could offer her a shred of insight into her father's killer. Her keen, analytical mind whirred as she absorbed the information, seeking patterns and connections in a quest for closure.

That was when she stumbled upon a statement from her mother, Aurora, taken during the initial police investigation. The words on the page seemed distant and detached, a stark contrast to the passion that usually colored her mother's writing. Aurora had been recounting the events leading up to her husband's death—the fundraiser, the hushed political discussions, and the phone call they shared shortly before Nathaniel's death.

"His voice sounded so...strained," Aurora had said in her statement. "He told me he loved me, but there was something off. I should've known something was wrong."

Dana felt a pang of sympathy for her mother. Despite their strained relationship, she knew that the loss of her father had hit Aurora hard.

Shaking off the melancholy, Dana decided to look up the online journal where her mother often submitted journalism pieces—an attempt to reconnect with her, even if only through her mother's published words.

The digital publication, called "The Free Mind," was a platform for independent journalists to share their thoughts on current events, politics, and social issues. The articles varied in intensity and focus, reflecting the diverse perspectives of its contributors. Known for its unapologetic stances, the journal had become a sanctuary for Aurora in the years following her husband's murder.

Scanning through the recent articles, Dana found one penned by her mother. Titled "The Fight for Equality: A Never-Ending Battle," the piece delved into the ongoing struggle for civil rights and the importance of continued activism. As she read, Dana found herself reluctantly admiring her mother's unwavering commitment to social justice.

History has shown us that progress is never achieved without resistance, Aurora wrote. But we cannot afford to grow complacent or discouraged. We must continue to fight for what is right, to ensure that every individual can live a life free from discrimination and oppression.

Dana felt a sudden yearning for her mother's presence. She stared at the smiling picture of Aurora at the bottom of the article, her eyes brimming with unshed tears.

"Mom," she whispered, "why did you leave us? Didn't you realize I needed you?"

With a heavy heart, Dana put her phone down and turned off the bedside lamp. The darkness enveloped the room, offering her no solace as she lay back on the pillow, her thoughts still occupied by her father's unsolved murder and the unspoken need for her mother's support.

As sleep finally claimed her, Dana found herself in a vivid dream. In it, she was standing outside the hotel where her father had been killed. The chill in the air bit at her exposed skin, and she shivered involuntarily, pulling her coat tighter around her slender frame. Her heartbeat quickened as she approached the hotel's entrance, her eyes darting nervously to every shadow, every passerby—searching for danger, even though she knew it was just a dream.

Once inside the hotel, the polished marble floors and ornate chandeliers did little to stifle Dana's growing anxiety.

"Please, Dad," she whispered under her breath, her hands trembling slightly as she made her way down the corridor to his room. "Please be okay." The sound of her own voice seemed to echo down the hallway, doing nothing to assuage her fears.

Finally, Dana arrived at the door of her father's hotel room. Hesitating for a moment, she steeled herself before raising her hand to knock.

"Dad!" she called out. "I need to talk to you!" But there was no response, only silence and the oppressive sense of dread that tightened around her heart.

"Open up, Dad!" she shouted, pounding on the door with increasing desperation. "Please, just let me know you're okay!"

Dana screamed, beating the door with both fists, the sound of her voice rising, thickening, filling her ears–

She woke to the sound of her phone vibrating on the nightstand. She picked it up, suddenly hoping that it might be her mother reaching out to see how she was doing.

"Hello?" she said, her heart still galloping from the nightmare.

"Hey," Sam said, and the way he spoke that one word was enough to tell Dana something was wrong. She sat up.

"What is it?" she asked.

"Bad news," Sam said. "There's been another murder." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TEN
 

 

Dana leaned back in her seat, gazing out past the wipers, which were hurrying back and forth in a feeble attempt to divert the cascade of rain running down the windshield, at the place where another innocent woman had breathed her last.

The area was cordoned off by yellow caution tape, the blue and red lights of the cruisers casting strange shadows on the abandoned stage and the rows of empty chairs. Dana could see forensic technicians in white coveralls working diligently, combing through the scene for any trace of evidence. In the distance, a small group of detectives huddled under umbrellas, speaking in hushed tones.

Dana felt a wave of nausea wash over her. The dream about her father's murder still clung to her like a cobweb, making it hard to breathe. And now, another life had been stolen, another family shattered.

She suddenly became aware that Sam, sitting in the passenger seat, was staring at her. "You okay?" he asked, his voice almost drowned out by the sound of the rain pounding on the roof of the car.

Dana forced a smile, attempting to hide the turmoil inside her. "Just tired and under-caffeinated," she lied, hoping Sam would buy it. She didn't want to talk about her dream, not now. He would express understanding, yes; he would be empathetic and attentive. But he couldn't really understand what she was going through, couldn't really share the burden. It was easier to just not talk about it.

Sam didn't seem entirely convinced by her explanation, but he chose not to press further. Just as Dana was about to open her door, a sudden knock on the window startled her. She quickly rolled it down, coming face-to-face with an officer whose dark hair was plastered to her forehead from the rain.

"Are you the FBI agents I was told to expect?" the officer asked.

"I'm Special Agent Dana Blaze, and this is my partner, Special Agent Sam Harris," Dana said, holding up her badge.

"Officer Maye," the woman said, nodding in acknowledgement. "Sorry for startling you. Just thought you might want these." She held up a pair of yellow rain slickers.

Dana smiled gratefully—she had a waterproof jacket, but it wasn't nearly as protective as a slicker. "Thank you, Officer Maye," she said.

Dana and Sam got out of the vehicle and donned their slickers. Despite the protection, however, Dana still found herself shivering beneath the hand of a cold wind that roved about.

"I'll walk you through the crime scene," Officer Maye

Dana followed Officer Maye, the rain-soaked ground squishing under her boots with each step. Sam fell in step beside her, his eyes scanning their surroundings with a jaded vigilance honed by years of experience.

"Petra Delgado was giving a speech here this afternoon," Officer Maye explained, gesturing to the small stage near the park's center. "Well, yesterday afternoon, I suppose—it's past midnight now. Anyway, shortly after she finished, she suddenly collapsed."

"This afternoon?" Dana asked, surprised. "Why weren't we called in sooner?"

"Initially, it was thought that she died due to an underlying health condition," Officer Maye said, her voice somber. "She had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It's a heart condition that can cause sudden death, especially during physical exertion."

"And how did you determine foul play was involved?" Sam asked, his brow furrowing in concern.

Dana answered the question before Officer Maye could. "They found a needle mark on Miss Delgado's arm," she guessed.

Officer Maye turned toward her, her eyebrows raised in surprise. "How'd you know that?"

"We found the same marks on the other two victims. It's our killer's MO."

Officer Maye nodded thoughtfully. "Well, I'm glad someone has some idea what's going on."

"Where was Miss Delgado when she died?" Sam asked.

Officer Maye pointed to a patch of concrete at the base of the stage. "Right there."

"Thank you, Officer Maye," Dana said, sensing they'd learned all they were going to learn from her for now. "We'll let you know if we have any other questions."

"Of course," Officer Maye said before turning and walking back toward the perimeter of the crime scene.

Dana's eyes narrowed as she studied the area where Petra had collapsed. She walked over to the spot and crouched down, examining the ground.

"Looking for anything in particular?" Sam asked. "A syringe, perhaps?"

"I don't think the killer would be that obvious," Dana murmured. "He'd at least attempt to hide it."

Just then, Dana spotted a small piece of parchment, tucked inside a plastic bag and wedged between the roots of a nearby tree. She probably wouldn't have noticed it if she hadn't been looking for it. Donning a pair of latex gloves, she reached in and pulled the bag free, revealing a series of letters scribbled across it.

"Sam, I've found another code," she said, holding up the bag.

"He even bagged it to protect it from the rain," Sam said wryly. "How generous."

Dana's brow furrowed as she studied the sequence of letters: "lomawnkae." It had to be another quote from the First Amendment. Perhaps–

"'Make no law,'" Sam said suddenly, his eyes lighting up with recognition. "That's what it says—'make no law.' Another line from the First Amendment."

Dana studied the parchment as she tried to discern the killer's motives. "Three victims, three quotes from the First Amendment. But what does it all mean?"

Dana couldn't shake the feeling that there was a deeper meaning behind the killer's choice of words, a connection she was missing. What was he trying to say with these quotes? She glanced around, her gaze sweeping over the crime scene and its surroundings, hoping for a spark of inspiration.

That's when she noticed the house across the street. The old Victorian building was adorned with ivy clinging to its brick facade, giving it an air of timeless elegance. A balcony protruded from the second floor, and there, sitting in a wheelchair and watching them intently, was an elderly man.

Dana nudged Sam, nodding toward the gentleman. "Maybe he saw something," she suggested. "We should talk to him."

"Worth a shot," Sam said, and together they crossed the street. They knocked on the heavy wooden door, which creaked open to reveal a middle-aged woman with short, curly brown hair and glasses perched on the edge of her nose. Her careworn face and sensible attire marked her as a caretaker, someone who had dedicated her life to looking after others.

"Hello, ma'am. We're with the FBI," Dana said, showing her badge. "We were wondering if the gentleman upstairs watched the rally earlier today. He might have seen something important."

The caretaker hesitated, worry creasing her forehead. "Mr. Folger needs his rest," she said protectively. "He's not well, you see. I don't want to disturb him."

"Ma'am, we understand your concern, but this is crucial to our investigation," Sam said. "If Mr. Folger saw anything, it could help us catch a dangerous criminal."

The woman seemed to weigh their words carefully before finally relenting with a sigh. "Alright, you can speak with him. But please, be brief."

"Thank you," Dana said gratefully.

The caretaker stepped aside, allowing Dana and Sam to enter the house. They followed her up a narrow staircase carpeted in worn, dark red fabric that muffled their footsteps. The walls were adorned with framed family photos, capturing generations of love and laughter. An electric chair lift ran alongside the stairs.

"Mr. Folger has been in the wheelchair for almost ten years now," the caretaker explained as they climbed. "He had a stroke that left him paralyzed on one side. It's been quite an adjustment, but we manage."

Dana glanced at her, noting the slight slump in the caretaker's shoulders and the tired lines around her eyes. "It must be incredibly hard work," she said, genuine admiration in her voice. "You're doing a great job taking care of him."

"Thank you," the woman replied softly, her face brightening ever so slightly.

At the top of the stairs, they turned into a spacious living area with large windows overlooking the street below. The room was filled with comfortable furniture, and a small television set stood in one corner. The balcony doors were open, and there sat Mr. Folger in his wheelchair, gazing out over the park.

"Mr. Folger," the caretaker announced, "these are agents Dana Blaze and Sam Harris from the FBI. They'd like to ask you a few questions about the rally earlier today."

The old man turned and looked up at them, his blue eyes sharp and alert beneath bushy white eyebrows. He had a thin, white beard that accentuated his high cheekbones, and his hands rested on a knitted blanket draped across his lap.

"Esmerelda," he said, "wheel me inside, would you? This cold is going to be the death of me."

Esmerelda did so. Then she shut the balcony doors and retreated to the far side of the room, folding laundry while keeping an eye on the agents.

"Alright, then," Mr. Folger said to Dana and Sam. "What can I do for you?"

"Mr. Folger, did you happen to watch the rally outside today?" Dana asked, getting straight to the point.

"Watched the whole thing, yes. Not as good as being there in person, but it's all I can do these days. Beats watching the boob-tube until my brains ooze out my ears." He chuckled.

"Did you see what happened to Miss Delgado?" Dana asked.

"I saw her collapse, if that's what you mean. Called an ambulance, too, though I can't guarantee I was the first one to do so. I may be old, but I'm not blind," he said, a hint of humor in his voice.

"Did you see anyone approach her shortly before that?" Sam asked. "Anyone who might've, say, bumped into her or hugged her, something that went beyond shaking hands?"

Mr. Folger took a deep breath and sighed, his nostril whistling as he did so. "Not that I recall, no. But I was a little distracted, to be fair—I was watching the man on the other side of the street."

"The man on the other side of the street?" Dana repeated, intrigued.

"Yes, the one who kept pacing back and forth. He caught my eye because he was wearing a hoodie and sunglasses, even though it wasn't that sunny out. Seemed a bit odd to me."

Dana and Sam exchanged a glance. "Can you describe him in more detail?" Sam asked.

Mr. Folger furrowed his brow, concentrating. "He was about average height, I'd say, and on the thin side. Couldn't see his face too well because of the sunglasses and hoodie, but I remember he had a tattoo on his right hand. Looked like a snake, maybe?"

Dana scribbled down the details in her notebook. "Have you ever seen him before?"

The old man shook his head.

"I have," Esmerelda said, looking pale and worried as she dropped a pair of compression socks and joined them. "There's a man who lives just down the street from here—Krenshaw, I think his name is. I've bumped into him a few times when I'm out running errands. He works night shifts at the local paper mill."

"Landry," Mr. Folger said. "It's called the South Landry Paper Mill."

Esmerelda nodded. "Yes, that's right." She paused, looking like she had more to say but wasn't sure if she wanted to share it.

"What is it?" Dana asked.

Esmerelda pursed her lips. "He's…he can be a real creep, you know? There was another rally here a while back, and as I was on my way back from the laundromat, I saw him standing at the back of the crowd, making these gestures at the woman talking. He saw me watching, so I looked away as fast as I could and pretended like I hadn't seen anything."

"What kind of gestures?" Sam asked. "Lewd ones?"

Esmerelda swallowed hard and shook her head. "He put his hands together like he could strangle the woman's throat from a distance." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER ELEVEN
 

 

The South Landry Paper Mill buzzed with activity as Dana and Sam entered, the machinery churning out endless streams of paper. The deafening noise made it difficult to hear anything else, and the air was heavy with the smell of wood pulp and chemicals.

Not seeing anyone who matched Krenshaw's description, Dana shouted over the din to Sam, "Let's split up and look for him!" Sam nodded, and they went separate ways, their eyes scanning for any sign of the man they sought.

As Dana ventured deeper into the mill, she took note of her surroundings. Massive machines pulsed and groaned, feeding on raw materials that would soon be transformed into paper products. Workers moved about, carefully monitoring the process while casting curious glances at Dana.

Dana spotted a man working alone near one of the large rollers, his back to her. His sleeves were rolled up, his bare arms smudged with some kind of grease. He seemed to be adjusting some dials on the machine, fine-tuning the pressure on the paper that fed through the rollers.

Dana approached the man, raising her voice to be heard above the roaring machinery. "Excuse me!" she shouted. "I'm looking for a man named Krenshaw!"

The man turned around, clearly startled by her sudden appearance. He raised an eyebrow, unable to hear her properly. "What?" he asked, straining to catch her words.

"I'm looking for Krenshaw!" she said. "Is he here?"

The man looked Dana up and down, as if taking her measure. He seemed to be amused by something. "Yeah, Krenshaw's here," he said, raising his voice to be heard over the cacophony of machinery. "You'll find him on the other side of the mill, working the drying rollers."

"Thanks," Dana replied, her gaze lingering on his greasy arms for a moment before she turned and headed toward the other side of the mill.

As she walked, however, she began to feel a nagging suspicion gnawing at the back of her mind. Something about the man had seemed off, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it. She tried to focus on her surroundings, the smell of hot paper pulp filling her nostrils and the vibrations from the machines reverberating through the floor beneath her feet.

Then, suddenly, it hit her. The snake tattoo Esmerelda had mentioned—the man Dana had just spoken with could've had such a tattoo, hidden beneath the grease. Her heart skipped a beat as she realized she might have just confronted the killer himself.

Dana spun around, ready to confront the man again, but he was gone. In the distance, she caught a glimpse of him disappearing through a doorway leading into another part of the mill. The door swung shut behind him, cutting off her view.

Dana's surroundings blurred as she sprinted after the man, her focus solely on the rapidly closing door. The cacophony of machinery and paper processing drowned out any sound Krenshaw might make. Overhead pipes groaned as they pumped water into the enormous vats that turned raw pulp into usable paper. The floor was slick with a mixture of water and wood fibers that made traction difficult and threatened to send her sprawling.

As Dana raced toward the doorway, she spotted a narrow passage between two stacks of massive paper rolls at the mouth of a dark, cavernous room. If her guess was correct, the room behind the rolls should connect with the room Krenshaw had entered, thus giving her a valuable shortcut and a chance at catching up to him.

Clenching her teeth, Dana veered off course and dove into the tight space. She could feel the weight of the paper rolls looming over her, a forest of tightly wound trees ready to collapse at any moment.

Emerging from the claustrophobic passage, Dana found herself in a dimly lit room. Shadows danced on the walls, cast by the flickering bulbs overhead. Pallets were stacked haphazardly around the room, waiting to be loaded with reams of finished paper and whisked away to their final destinations. Despite the chaos of the paper mill outside, this room felt eerily still, almost as if time had slowed to a crawl.

"Krenshaw!" Dana said, drawing her gun and training it on the shifting shadows before her. "I know you're in here. Come out now, and we can talk."

Silence hung in the air. Dana's eyes darted across the room, searching for any sign of movement.

"Last chance, Krenshaw," she warned, her voice low and controlled. "Don't make this harder than it has to be."

Dana's eyes narrowed as she focused on the small gap between a stack of pallets and the factory wall. It was an ideal hiding spot—just enough room for a person to squeeze in and remain concealed from view. She approached cautiously, gun still drawn, ready for Krenshaw to make a move at any moment.

"Krenshaw," she called out again, her voice steely. "There's nowhere left for you to run, Krenshaw."

The only answer was the distant hum of machinery and her own heart pounding in her ears. Dana reached the gap and peered around the corner, fully expecting to find Krenshaw staring back at her. But the space was empty, save for a few scattered pieces of debris.

"Damn it," she muttered under her breath, frustration flaring. She had been so sure she'd found him. Then, a sudden noise behind her snapped her back to full alertness—the sound of footsteps rapidly approaching.

Whirling around, Dana barely had time to register the figure charging toward her before he slammed into her, knocking her off her feet. She hit the floor hard, pain shooting through her hip as Krenshaw sprinted away, his sights set on a nearby exit.

Just as Krenshaw was about to reach the exit, Sam appeared from the shadows like a phantom, extending his leg to trip the fleeing man. Krenshaw went down, sprawling across the concrete floor, and Sam moved quickly to arrest him.

"Gotcha," Sam said, smirking as he cuffed Krenshaw's wrists behind his back.

Dana finally managed to stand, rubbing her aching hip as she limped over to join them.

"Good of you to join us," Sam said to her, his eyes twinkling with mischief.

"Listen," Krenshaw said suddenly, his voice strained with desperation. "You've got the wrong guy. I'm not a murderer."

Dana raised an eyebrow, surprised by his claim. She exchanged a quick glance with Sam before turning her attention back to Krenshaw. Her eyes narrowed, studying the man's intently.

"How do you know this has anything to do with murder?" she asked. 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWELVE
 

 

Dana Blaze leaned against the cold wall of the observation room, her eyes fixed on Michael Krenshaw through the one-way mirror. The dim light accentuated the sunken hollows beneath his sharp cheekbones and the dark circles under his piercing eyes. His long, greasy hair was tied back behind his head, revealing a high forehead and thin lips pressed together in a stoic line. His arms were covered in grease and grime from working at the mill, yet he seemed strangely calm, almost serene, in the sterile environment of the interrogation room.

Staring at him, Dana recalled the words Krenshaw had uttered when they arrested him: I'm not a murderer. How had he known they wanted to speak to him about a murder, since they hadn't mentioned anything about it?

"Look at him," Sam said, joining her by the mirror. "Just sitting there like he's waiting for a bus or something." He shook his head, his brow furrowing with suspicion. "There's something not right about this guy, Dana."

She nodded slowly, her gaze never leaving Krenshaw. "I agree," she said quietly. "But we won't get anywhere just standing here. Are you ready to go in?"

"Let's do it," Sam said.

As Dana reached for the door handle, she hesitated and grabbed a box of tissues from the nearby table. Then, with a deep breath, she opened the door and stepped out into the police precinct hallway.

Dana found herself enveloped in a heavy silence that permeated the air. The atmosphere was stagnant, weighed down by the lateness of the night and the exhaustion of the officers who still lingered about their duties.

As Dana and Sam walked toward the interrogation room, two uniformed officers appeared around the corner, escorting a disheveled man in handcuffs between them. The man's hair was a tangled mess, his clothes stained and rumpled. A strong odor of alcohol and body odor wafted off of him, making Dana wrinkle her nose in distaste.

When Dana reached the door of the interrogation room, she paused to steel herself, preparing for whatever mind games Krenshaw might throw at her. They entered the room, and Krenshaw's smile greeted them like an unwelcome guest.

"Can I go now?" he asked nonchalantly, as if this were all just a minor inconvenience.

Dana raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "We haven't even talked with you yet."

He shrugged, leaning back in his chair. "I'm innocent, so what does it matter?"

"Clean your arms," Dana said curtly, tossing the box of tissues onto the table in front of Krenshaw.

He glanced at the tissues and then back at Dana, his smile widening into a smirk. "You sure about that? You'll probably need those when I walk out of here, a free man."

Dana's jaw tightened, but she refused to let him get under her skin. She had dealt with far worse criminals than Krenshaw in her career, and she wasn't about to let him shake her confidence.

"Show us the tattoo," Sam said. There wasn't so much as a hint of levity in his voice.

Krenshaw's smirk vanished, replaced by a flicker of surprise. "How'd you know about that?" he asked.

"Show us," Dana said.

Krenshaw hesitated for a moment before grabbing a tissue from the box on the table. He scrubbed at the grease coating his arms, revealing the snake tattoo beneath. Its body coiled around his forearm, its head poised as if ready to strike, fangs bared menacingly.

"Interesting choice," Dana said, studying the tattoo. "What's the significance?"

"Political," Krenshaw replied, his tone defensive. "The snake represents resistance against tyranny. It's a symbol of freedom."

Dana raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "And what exactly are your political views, Mr. Krenshaw?"

"Power should belong to the people, not to those who claim they're better than us," Krenshaw said, his eyes glowing with passion. "Too many politicians ignore the needs of their constituents while lining their own pockets."

"Is that why you were at the rally yesterday?" Sam asked.

Krenshaw's face went blank, his eyes darting between the two agents. The room seemed to close in as silence engulfed them. Dana leaned forward slightly, sensing Krenshaw's unease.

"Did you hear Petra Delgado give her speech?" she asked.

Krenshaw remained silent, his eyes narrowing as he weighed his options. Dana could practically see the gears turning in his mind, the careful calculations he was making before deciding whether or not to speak.

"Did you?" she repeated, refusing to let him off the hook.

"Look," Sam said with a tired sigh. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way. But trust me, it's in your best interest to cooperate and tell us what you know."

"Oh, yeah?" Krenshaw asked with a flicker of defiance. "What's the hard way? You going to beat me up like those fascists you call police officers?"

Dana's patience was wearing thin. "We don't condone police brutality, Mr. Krenshaw. We're here to get to the truth, not to harm you."

Krenshaw snorted. "The truth? You think you can handle the truth? You're just glorified interrogators, trying to get a confession out of me because you've got nothing else to go on."

Dana leaned back in her chair, her arms crossed over her chest. "We have a witness who saw you at the scene of the crime." She considered adding in what Esmerelda had told them about the previous incident, the one during which Krenshaw had made a strangling gesture at another speaker, but given the fact that Krenshaw had seen Esmerelda then, Dana didn't want to put Esmerelda in harm's way by mentioning it.

Krenshaw's eyes widened in surprise. "What witness? Who is it?"

"We're the ones asking the questions here," Sam said. "We know you were at the rally, so you might as well admit it."

Krenshaw hesitated a moment longer, looking like he might lie just to spite them. Then, relaxing, he sighed and looked down at the table. "Fine. Yes, I was at the rally."

"And what were you doing there?" Dana asked.

"I...I went there to talk to Petra privately," Krenshaw admitted, his voice barely above a whisper.

"Did you speak with her?" Dana asked, watching him closely for any signs of deception.

Krenshaw shook his head. "No. I changed my mind and left before I could even get close to her."

Dana studied his face, trying to determine if he was telling the truth or not. There was something about his demeanor that suggested he might be hiding more than he was letting on.

"Why did you want to talk to Petra in the first place?" she asked.

Krenshaw looked away, clearly uncomfortable with the question. "I'd rather not say," he muttered, avoiding their gazes.

"Come on, Krenshaw," Sam said. "If you're innocent, then you have nothing to hide. Tell us why you wanted to speak with her."

"We dated a few months ago, okay?" Krenshaw said, bitterness creeping into his voice. "It didn't end well."

Dana raised an eyebrow. "What happened?"

Krenshaw's face was beginning to color. "Petra dumped me, that's what happened. But it wasn't just a simple breakup. She humiliated me in front of all my friends."

"How?" Dana asked, sensing they were getting closer to understanding Krenshaw's connection to Petra.

Krenshaw hesitated before answering, his eyes darting back and forth between Dana and Sam. "We were out having dinner with a bunch of my friends," he said, his voice flat. "Things started to get a little heated, and she...she accused me of cheating on her with one of her best friends."

"And did you?" Dana asked, her eyes still fixed on Krenshaw's face.

"No, of course not!" Krenshaw exclaimed, his voice rising. "I would never do something like that. She was just trying to save face, to come up with a good excuse to break up with me because she couldn't handle having a relationship. Her true love was her political activism." He shook his head, clearly still bitter about it.

"I would've thought you two would have that in common," Sam said.

"That's what I thought at first, too. But she was as by-the-book as they come. I'm more of a free thinker."

"Is that why you went to the rally?" Dana asked. "To confront her about it?"

Krenshaw shook his head. "No, I told you. I changed my mind before I could even get close to her."

Sam leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms as he studied Krenshaw. "I have a theory," he said. "I don't think you went to that rally just to talk to Petra. I think you wanted to get back at her for humiliating you."

"No," Krenshaw denied vehemently, his eyes widening. "That's not true."

Sam continued, undeterred by Krenshaw's denial. "I think you jabbed her with a needle and poisoned her. A perfect way to get your revenge without anyone noticing."

Krenshaw's face flushed with anger, and his fists clenching on the table. "I would never kill her!" he shouted, his voice cracking with emotion. "I was hurt, but I wouldn't do that!"

Dana regarded him closely, searching for any sign of deception in his words or body language. His reaction seemed genuine, but she needed more information nonetheless.

"Alright," she said. "Let's assume you're telling the truth. There's still the matter of you running from us when we confronted you at the paper mill. Care to explain that to us?"

Krenshaw slumped back in his chair, his shoulders sagging. "I heard about Petra's death on the news," he said. "I figured the cops would come looking for me since I was at the rally. I don't have an alibi to prove I didn't kill her, and I didn't want to get framed for something I didn't do."

Dana scrutinized his reaction, searching for any sign that he was lying. But his calm demeanor and unwavering confidence seemed genuine, and she found herself believing him.

Still, he had – by his own admission – been at the rally where Petra was killed. How could she rule him out? How could she prove he hadn't been the one who stabbed Petra with a needle?

She decided to see if he had alibis for the past two murders. "Mr. Krenshaw," she said, "where were you yesterday morning around eleven o'clock?"

"Yesterday?" Krenshaw's eyes were vague for a moment. "I was at home, sleeping. I work the night shift at the mill, so I usually sleep during the day."

"Can anyone else confirm that?" Sam asked.

Krenshaw nodded. "Yeah, my neighbor saw me coming home just before seven a.m. He usually sits outside drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette, so he saw me pull up in my car. He can tell you I didn't go anywhere until the afternoon, too."

"What about last Wednesday, around nine a.m.?" Dana asked.

"I was out with some coworkers from the mill," Krenshaw replied, gaining confidence now. "We were grabbing breakfast at a diner close to the plant. I sat with my supervisor and another coworker, and we talked about some work-related stuff. They'll vouch for me."

Dana sat back in her chair, deep in thought. Krenshaw's alibis for the past two murders seemed solid, and his story about wanting to talk to Petra seemed plausible.

"Alright," she murmured, turning to Sam. "Can I speak with you in the hallway for a moment?"

Sam nodded, and they stepped outside the interrogation room, leaving Krenshaw behind.

"I think he's telling the truth," Dana said to Sam in a low voice. "He's got alibis for two of the three murders, and I really don't think we're dealing with multiple killers here. We can keep him on ice for now, but unless we discover a syringe with his fingerprints on it, I don't think he killed Petra."

Sam clenched his jaw, a subtle hint that he was as disappointed by this result as Dana felt. "Before we draw any conclusions," he said, "I think we should talk to Petra's family. We need to learn all we can about her—and figure out if this Krenshaw is pulling the wool over our eyes." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
 

 

Dana's heart was heavy as she watched the woman usher two sleepy-looking kids into a minivan while a man – her husband, presumably – looked on from the open garage, the leash of a medium-sized dog wrapped around one hand. Nobody spoke. Everything happened with a fragile kind of stillness, as if the scene were no more substantial than a dream.

"Guess they already know about Petra," Sam said. "You can see it on her parents' faces."

Dana and Sam were parked across the street in a quiet suburban neighborhood on the outskirts of Philadelphia. It was early morning, shortly after sunrise.

As the minivan pulled away, Dana and Sam got out and approached the man, who could only be Mr. Delgado. The dog, a mixed breed with a coat of black and white patches, barked at them, its tail wagging cautiously. The man, who appeared to be in his late forties, looked up at them as he tightened his grip on the leash. He had dark hair, streaked with gray, and deep-set eyes that were red-rimmed from a lack of sleep or perhaps tears.

"Are you Rafael Delgado?" Dana asked gently, her eyes meeting the man's as she tried to gauge his emotional state.

"Yes, I am," he replied, his voice weary. "You're here about my daughter, Petra, aren't you?"

Dana nodded. "We're with the FBI. We'd like to speak with you about her, if that's all right. May we come inside?"

"Of course," Rafael said, motioning for them to follow him through the garage and into the house.

As they passed through the garage, Dana couldn't help but notice how it seemed to tell the story of a loving family. Tools were neatly organized on pegboards along the walls, and several bikes of varying sizes stood in a row. She spotted a half-finished birdhouse on a workbench, surrounded by wood shavings and paint cans, clearly a project that Petra's younger siblings had been working on.

Once inside the house, Rafael unclipped the dog's leash, allowing it to roam freely. The dog immediately went to Sam, sniffing him curiously before wagging its tail in approval. Sam grinned and bent down to pet the dog, scratching behind its ears.

"Got a soft spot for dogs," Sam said, looking up at Rafael. "I have a husky named Max back home."

"Really? We love dogs too," Rafael said, his eyes lighting up momentarily as he shared a connection with Sam. "This one's name is Lucky. He's been a great comfort to us, especially during these difficult times."

As Dana listened to their exchange, she couldn't help but feel empathy for the family. The loss of a loved one was never easy, and the circumstances surrounding Petra's death only compounded the tragedy. She knew how important it was to find answers for the Delgados, not just for the sake of justice but also for their own healing process.

Dana watched as Rafael took a seat on the living room couch, his hands clasped between his knees. The crisp lighting cast shadows across his face, emphasizing the lines of worry and grief etched onto his features. The room was tastefully decorated with family photos and mementos, but there was an air of melancholy hanging heavy in the space.

"Mr. Delgado," Dana began gently as she and Sam sat down in chairs facing the couch, "it's clear that your daughter had a strong sense of civic responsibility. Can you tell us more about that?"

Rafael nodded, a sad smile gracing his lips. "Petra... she was always passionate about helping others, even when she was a little girl. Her mother and I recognized that spark in her early on, and we did our best to nurture it. We'd take her to community events, volunteer at local charities, and engage in political discussions at the dinner table."

His voice was filled with pride, but also tinged with sorrow. "We never expected that her dedication to free speech and standing up for what's right would put her in danger."

Sam leaned forward, elbows resting on his knees. "Did Petra have any enemies or anyone who might have wanted to harm her?"

Rafael shook his head. "No, I can't think of anyone who would want to hurt her. She was well-liked and respected by everyone who knew her."

Dana hesitated before asking, "What about Michael Krenshaw? What can you tell us about their relationship?"

Rafael's expression darkened, his jaw clenching. "That man...he was bad news from the start. Their relationship was toxic, and we could see the toll it was taking on Petra. He was possessive, paranoid, and he had a volatile temper."

"How so?" Sam asked.

"Once, he accused Petra of flirting with one of her classmates," Rafael said, his knuckles white from gripping his own hands. "He confronted her in public, screaming at her and causing a scene. We happened to be nearby and intervened, but it was clear that Krenshaw was out of control."

"Mr. Delgado," Dana said cautiously, "do you think Krenshaw might have tried to harm Petra?"

"Krenshaw?" He considered for a moment, then shook his head. "If Krenshaw had wanted to hurt Petra, he wouldn't have used a needle. He would've used his fists. And he wouldn't have been smart enough to get away with it."

Dana and Sam exchanged a glance. Dana decided to change the subject.

"I know Petra was passionate about politics," she began, "but did she ever talk about the First Amendment in particular?"

Rafael nodded, his expression softening as if sorting through memories of conversations with his daughter. "Yes, she was particularly passionate about free speech. It was something she cared about deeply, even as a child."

"Can you explain why it was so important to her?" Dana asked.

Rafael blinked thoughtfully, his eyes distant. "Petra always believed that everyone should have the right to express their opinions, no matter how unpopular or controversial they might be." He let out a heavy sigh. "We encouraged her to stand up for what she believed in, to use her voice to make a difference. She took that to heart, and it became her life's mission."

Rafael checked the time on his watch and sighed, his shoulders slumping. "I apologize, but I need to make a call. My parents still don't know what happened to Petra, and I have to break the news to them."

Dana felt a pang of sympathy for the man standing before her, knowing that the conversation ahead would be nothing short of heartbreaking. "Of course, Mr. Delgado. Thank you for your time and cooperation. If we have any further questions or information, we'll be in touch."

Rafael nodded, his eyes glassy as he prepared himself for the difficult task ahead. "Thank you," he said.

The cool morning air surrounded Dana and Sam as they stepped out of the Delgados' house. The morning was quiet, broken only by the rumble of a trash truck as it made its rounds.

"It sounds like Krenshaw may very well be innocent," Sam said, breaking the silence as they approached their SUV, "but unfortunately we're no closer to finding the killer."

Dana nodded, her frustration mounting. She ran a hand through her hair, tucking a strand behind her ear. "I was hoping for something more from our conversation with Rafael. What about the toxicology report on the poison? Any word from the lab?"

Sam pulled out his phone and shook his head. "Haven't heard anything yet."

As they climbed into the SUV, the darkness of the car interior felt suffocating. Dana's mind raced with unanswered questions and leads that seemed to go nowhere. Just as she turned the key in the ignition, however, her phone rang. It was Gerry Michaels.

"Where are you?" he asked without preamble, his voice tense.

"Leaving the Delgados' house," Dana began. "We just spoke with Mr. Delgado about—" That was as much as she managed to share before Michaels cut her off.

"Head to the headquarters of the Liberty Bell Tribune as soon as possible."

Dana was silent for several heartbeats, absorbing this. "Wait...why? What's going on?"

"We might've just gotten a big break, that's what's going on," Michaels said. "The killer sent us a message." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
 

 

"He's taunting us," Sam muttered, his jaw set in a tight line as he stared at the handwritten message they'd been shown upon arriving at the Liberty Bell Tribune's headquarters. "This guy's really playing with fire."

Dana studied the message under the harsh fluorescent lights of the conference room. The killer's handwriting was awkward and stilted, as if he had worked very hard to make it legible. The note read:

I like you serve a higher power. My mission is divine my plans unstoppable. Get in my way, and you will only be crushed.

Dana leaned back, thinking about the message and the killer's decision to send it here. The Liberty Bell Tribune was one of Philadelphia's most prominent newspapers, with a wide readership that spanned all corners of the city. Known for its investigative journalism and political commentary, it made sense that the killer would choose this publication as a platform to communicate with law enforcement.

The conference room buzzed with a tense energy as Dana scanned the faces of the task force members, each one present for their unique expertise. Officer Tony Fall, head of the local police, stood out among them: a tall man in his early fifties with salt-and-pepper hair cropped short and a chiseled jaw that seemed perpetually set in determination. He had been the first to examine the letter from the killer, and Dana made a mental note of his keen observance.

Frank Wasser, owner of the Liberty Bell Tribune, leaned against the wall, quietly observing the proceedings. His balding head gleamed under the fluorescent lights, and the tension in his brow was apparent even behind his wire-rimmed glasses. He wore suspenders over his white dress shirt, giving him an air of authority.

"Mr. Wasser," Dana said, drawing his attention. "Could you tell us who found this letter?"

"Ah, yes," Frank replied, adjusting his glasses. "It was our secretary, Leslie. She's just a temp, really, but she's the one who came across it first thing this morning. I don't think she realized the gravity of what she'd found." His tone suggested that he didn't consider Leslie particularly significant in the grand scheme of things.

"Can we speak with her?" Dana asked.

Frank hesitated just for a moment. "I can answer any questions you might have, Agent Blaze. There's really no need to involve her in this."

Dana pressed her lips together in a thin, crisp smile. "It seems to me she's already involved."

Frank stared at her for a few seconds longer before taking the hint. Finally, with a smile even cooler than Dana's, he nodded. "Of course, Agent Blaze. I'll fetch her at once."

His frozen smile remained on his face as he left the conference room. A few moments later, he returned with a young woman in tow. Her hands twisted nervously at the hem of her blouse, and her eyes darted around the room, avoiding direct contact with anyone. Wisps of mousey brown hair had escaped from her hastily done bun, which framed her heart-shaped face.

"This is Leslie," Frank said, his voice betraying a hint of impatience. "She'll tell you whatever you want to know."

Dana sensed the girl's discomfort but wasted no time in addressing her. "Thank you for coming in, Leslie. Could you please tell us where you found the letter?"

"Uh, yes," Leslie stammered, finally making eye contact with Dana. "I found it on my desk this morning when I came in to start my shift. It was just lying there, right next to my computer."

"What time did you come in?" Sam asked.

"Six o'clock. I was the first one here." She colored a little. "Have to get the coffee started early, you know."

Dana felt a stirring of sympathy for this young woman who had unknowingly stumbled into the middle of a murder investigation. "And did you touch the letter or move it at all?"

"No, no, I didn't touch it," Leslie said, shaking her head emphatically. "I knew it wasn't mine and I didn't want to mess with anything, so I called Mr. Wasser right away."

"Good thinking," Dana nodded. "And did you notice anything else unusual this morning?"

Leslie furrowed her brow, thinking. "Not really. It was pretty quiet, just like any other morning. Although..." She hesitated, as if unsure whether to continue.

"Although what?" Officer Fall asked, leaning forward with interest.

"Come on, Leslie," Frank said impatiently. "Don't be cryptic."

Leslie bit her lip nervously. "Well, I did notice that the front door was unlocked when I came in. That's never happened before. I thought maybe one of the delivery people forgot to lock up after dropping off the papers."

Dana frowned. "Did you see anyone around?"

"No, but I didn't really look either. I just assumed it was a mistake and locked the door myself."

"Thank you, Leslie," Dana said kindly. "That's all we need from you for now. We'll be in touch if we have any more questions."

As the young woman left the room, Dana turned her attention back to Frank. "Have you had any break-ins before?" she asked.

"Break-ins?" Frank frowned. "No, not that I recall."

"What about any disgruntled employees you might've fired?" Sam asked.

Frank shook his head. "No, I can't think of anyone who would hold a grudge like that. We run a pretty tight ship here at the Tribune."

Dana exchanged a look with Sam. "Well, there's always a first time for everything. We'll need a list of all your employees and anyone who's had access to this building in the last 24 hours."

"Of course, Agent Blaze," Frank said, nodding. "I'll have my assistant compile a list for you right away."

Dana stared at him, waiting. "That'll be all, Mr. Wasser. Thank you for your help."

Frank lingered a few seconds longer. It was clear he didn't like being dismissed. He couldn't very well demand to be part of an ongoing federal investigation, however.

He ducked his head. "Of course." As he retreated to the door, Dana called to him.

"And Mr. Wasser," she said. "I hope we can count on your discretion. It's very important we keep a tight lid on this and control the flow of information to the public."

"Of course," he said again with a greasy smile. "There won't be a peep, not from anyone here." With that, he slipped out and closed the door behind him.

"Alright," Sam said, clearing his throat. "So the killer broke in and dropped the letter off in person. Is there any way we caught him on camera?"

Officer Fall shook his head. "There are no cameras—I already checked." He paused. "If I may, I've got a theory about how we can catch this sicko."

Dana raised an eyebrow. "Let's hear it, Officer Fall."

He leaned forward. "We know he's bold enough to break into a newspaper office and leave a letter behind. What if we use that to our advantage?"

"How so?" Sam asked.

"We leak a fake news story in the Tribune, something that'll get his attention," Officer Fall said. "Then we set up a trap and wait for him to come to us."

"Too risky," a young FBI agent with narrow sideburns answered, shaking his head.

"How so? If it doesn't work out, what's the harm?"

"The harm," Sam said, "is that we've raised awareness about this creep, which is exactly what he wants: to put himself in the public's eye." Sam shook his head and leaned back. "No, we can't just give him what he wants. It'll only make him bolder."

"Maybe he's part of some underground hate group," suggested a young officer from the corner of the room. "We should look into known extremist organizations."

"Or it could be more than one person working together," another chimed in. "This kind of operation might require a team."

"Enough," Sam said, his voice cutting through the speculation. "Let's not jump to conclusions without any evidence. Our killer has been precise and calculated so far; we have no reason to believe there's a whole group behind this."

The room fell silent as they considered Sam's words. He continued, "From what we've seen, the killer is intelligent and highly motivated by his beliefs. But that doesn't necessarily mean he's part of some larger organization."

Sam turned his gaze towards Dana, who was still studying the letter. "Dana, what do you think?"

All eyes shifted toward Dana, waiting for her insight. She looked up from the letter, feeling the weight of their expectations. Taking a deep breath, she spoke slowly and deliberately. "The messages we've received so far have all focused exclusively on the First Amendment."

Pausing for a moment, she continued, "Though I'm passionate about the Constitution, I must admit that I don't know it as well as some experts. If we want to truly understand the killer's motivation, we need to speak with a constitutional law expert. They might be able to shed light on what drives this person."

A murmur of agreement rippled across the room.

"Now that you mention it, I happen to know a constitutional law expert in the area," Officer Fall said, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. "Professor Charles Abrams. He's exceptionally good at what he does."

Dana looked at him with interest. "And how do you know him?"

"Attended a few lectures he gave on the Constitution for law enforcement officers," Fall explained. "The man knows his stuff, and he's got a way of making it relatable. I think he could help us understand what we're dealing with here."

"Alright," Dana said, taking charge. "Sam and I will meet with him." She turned to Sam, who nodded.

"And the rest of us?" Officer Fall asked. "What do we do, sit on our hands?"

"That's one option," Dana said mildly. "Or you can get busy. Check the lock and see how the killer got in—did he pick it? Did he get his hands on a key, and if so, how? What about the neighboring businesses? Was anyone working earlier this morning? Is it possible anyone saw our killer?"

She leaned forward, meeting the eyes of each person in turn. "If we want to take this guy down, we're going to think outside the box. I suggest you start now—before he kills again."

As Dana and Sam left the conference room, a hush fell over the gathered reporters and staff milling about in the hallway. They watched Dana and Sam intently, their eyes wide with curiosity and expectation. Dana sensed the pressure to solve this case was mounting.

"We'd better find this killer fast," Sam remarked quietly to Dana as they walked. "I know you warned Wasser to keep things quiet...but I have a feeling this case is about to get a whole lot more public." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
 

 

The man sat alone in a cold, dark basement, his breath visible in the dim light as he examined the political pin between his thumb and index finger.

It was an intricate design—a golden eagle, wings spread wide, clutching a banner that read "Freedom" in bold letters. The pin's metallic surface gleamed softly as it caught the faint light streaming from a single bulb overhead.

The rally was still fresh in the man's mind. The air had been filled with excitement and fervor, people passionately shouting their beliefs at the top of their lungs. It had been there that he'd killed Petra Delgado, her fiery spirit snuffed out like a candle in the wind. The man smiled as he recalled the scene, thinking about how oblivious everyone had been to the true danger lurking among them. They were sheep, and he was the wolf who walked unnoticed in their midst.

His gaze shifted from the pin to the walls surrounding him. They were adorned with photographs he had taken of each victim before they met their untimely end. In one image, Emily Haven stood on a stage, her eyes alight with passion as she delivered a speech to a captivated audience. In another, Julia Bennett sat on a park bench, deeply engrossed in a book, her face lit by the dappled sunlight filtering through the trees above.

The man's eyes lingered on each photograph, feeling a sense of pride and satisfaction in the memories they evoked. It was a dark gallery of his own making, a testament to his cunning and power over those who had crossed his path.

As he continued to admire his grisly collection, the distant rumble of traffic outside the basement joined with the hum of the small refrigerator along the wall, both sounds as comforting to the man as a mother's soothing voice. Down here, he was safe—untouchable in the sanctuary he had created for himself.

The man's thoughts drifted back to his childhood, when he had first discovered the intoxicating thrill of taking a life. He had been only twelve years old when he killed his first animal, a stray cat that had wandered onto his family's property. The rush of adrenaline, the sense of control—it had awakened something within him, an insatiable hunger that only grew stronger with each new kill.

Over time, his prey became larger, more challenging—rabbits, raccoons, even a deer once. But it wasn't until he claimed his first human victim that he truly understood the depth of his obsession. The power to snuff out another person's existence was unparalleled, and he reveled in it.

"Ah, yes," the man murmured to himself, reflecting on the satisfaction he had derived from each kill. "There's just nothing quite like it."

His fingers lingered on the pin one last time before he carefully placed it back on the table beside the camera, a subtle smile playing at the corners of his lips. He knew that soon enough, the desire for another kill would consume him once more, and he would begin the hunt anew.

The man's gaze shifted from the political pin he had been examining to the camera. He felt a tingle of excitement as he picked it up and started looking through the pictures stored within. These images captured his next prey, a young woman whose passionate political activism had caught his attention. She would soon meet the same fate as those before her.

The photographs showed the woman in various locations: at a bustling café, deep in conversation with friends; walking hurriedly down a busy street, her vibrant red scarf billowing behind her; and attending political rallies, her eyes alight with conviction. The man could practically hear her impassioned words echoing through the crowds, which only fueled his desire to extinguish that fire.

As he scrutinized each image, he admired how well he had captured her essence. Her raven-black hair framed her determined face, her brown eyes filled with an intensity that was both captivating and infuriating. The man knew that her fervor would soon be silenced by his own hand, and the thought sent a shiver of anticipation down his spine.

With a satisfied smirk, he returned the camera to its place on the table. His focus now turned to a corkboard adorned with a trio of pins, each bearing the symbol of a different political movement. He picked up the pin he had been holding earlier – the one he had acquired at Petra Delgado's rally – and pressed it into the corkboard alongside the others.

Next, the man approached the refrigerator, its white surface a stark contrast against the grimy basement. Opening the door, he revealed a collection of bottles filled with clear liquid. Each container held a different concentration of the poisonous concoction he had used to subdue his victims. The deadly elixirs glistened under the refrigerator light, their innocuous appearances belying their lethal contents.

With a steady hand, the man picked up a syringe from the assortment nestled among the bottles of clear liquid. He selected a particular bottle, one he knew held the precise concentration he desired for his next kill. Carefully, he plunged the needle into the container, drawing the lethal concoction into the syringe with practiced precision.

Once satisfied with the amount, the man capped the syringe and closed the refrigerator door, a smile playing at the corners of his mouth. The anticipation of the upcoming hunt sent shivers down his spine as he slipped the syringe into the large pocket of his dark jacket, concealing it from view.

"Time to educate another misguided soul," he murmured, relishing the thought of snuffing out yet another flame of idealism.

Taking a deep breath to steady himself, the man climbed the creaky wooden stairs that led from his macabre sanctuary to the bustling world outside. Upon reaching the top, he pulled open the heavy door, revealing the vibrant street beyond. The morning air was crisp and cool, carrying with it the scent of fallen leaves and brewing coffee from nearby cafes. The sun cast long shadows on the sidewalk as it began its slow ascent into the sky.

The streets were already teeming with life as pedestrians scurried about, eager to begin their day. Businessmen and women hustled past, clutching briefcases and coffee cups, while students chatted animatedly on their way to class. Cars honked impatiently, their drivers navigating the congested roads with practiced ease.

Whistling a jaunty tune, the man slipped into the crowd, walking down the street. He moved with an easy confidence, his dark hair and chiseled features drawing admiring glances from passersby. They saw a handsome, well-dressed man strolling along on a crisp autumn morning—not the cold-blooded killer that lurked beneath the surface.

With each step, the leaves beneath his shoes crunched satisfyingly, their vibrant hues of red, orange, and yellow painting the sidewalk like nature's canvas. The chill in the air was invigorating, and the man savored the sensation as it nipped at his cheeks, the collar of his jacket pulled up around his neck.

He reveled in the anonymity the bustling city offered him. Surrounded by people wrapped up in their own lives, no one paid him any real attention. It was as if he were invisible, free to move about unnoticed, undetected.

And best of all, free to strike again. 

 

 

 

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
 

 

Meanwhile, Dana drove down the busy Philadelphia streets, her eyes scanning the road ahead while her mind churned with the details of the case. Sam, sitting in the passenger seat, browsed through his phone, seemingly engrossed in whatever he was reading.

"Well, that didn't take long," Sam said, shaking his head.

Dana, piloting the unmarked SUV down the busy Philadelphia streets, glanced over at him, eyebrows raised in curiosity. "What are you talking about?"

"Someone leaked details about the letter left at the Liberty Bell Tribune," he said, scrolling through the article on his screen. "The media's dubbed our guy the 'Constitution Killer.'"

"Damn it," Dana muttered under her breath, gripping the steering wheel a little tighter. This was exactly what she'd intended to avoid. She didn't want the killer to play on the fears of the public. She knew from past experience how, given enough time, a serial killer's reputation could reach almost mythic proportions, becoming more a creature of legend than a flesh-and-blood person.

Sometimes, these killers became as popular as Hollywood celebrities.

"Media's always looking for a catchy name," Sam said, his voice tinged with disdain. "It doesn't matter how many lives are at stake or how much harder they make our jobs by sensationalizing the crimes."

Dana nodded and turned her attention back to her driving. They were on their way to speak with Professor Charles Abrams, a Constitutional expert over at Miner State College. They hadn't been able to reach him by phone, but Dana was hoping to catch him between classes.

"Listen to this," Sam went on, shaking his head in disbelief. "'Beware, citizens, the Constitution Killer is lurking in the shadows, ready to strike at any moment. Be vigilant, be prepared, and most importantly, be afraid.'"

"That's awful," Dana said, disgusted by the blatant fear-mongering. "This is the last thing we need. I wanted to control the narrative about the case, not let it spiral out of control like this."

"Unfortunately, once the media gets their hands on something, there's not much we can do," Sam said, his tone sympathetic yet resigned.

Dana sighed, knowing he was right. "I just worry about what could happen now. It might make it even more difficult for us to catch the killer. And what if it inspires copycat killers?"

"Guess it's out of our hands now," Sam said.

For a moment, both Dana and Sam fell silent as they drove through the streets of Philadelphia. The early sun cast a warm glow on the old brick buildings that lined the street, while fallen leaves danced in whirlwinds stirred up by passing cars. It was a picturesque scene that belied the grim reality they were facing.

They passed a football field where a group of high school students were practicing. The sound of their cheers and the thud of their bodies colliding filled the air. Dana felt a pang of sadness as she watched them, wondering if they knew how fragile life really was.

Suddenly, she felt Sam's eyes on her.

"I never asked you, did you ever play any sports growing up?" he asked.

"Uh, yeah, actually," Dana replied, slightly surprised by the sudden shift in conversation. "I played soccer and ran track in high school." A small smile formed on her face as memories of her athletic days returned to her. "Why do you ask?"

"Really? You must have been fast," Sam said, chuckling. "I played football myself. It wasn't the best, but I enjoyed it."

Absently, Dana tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. "Quarterback?"

He shook his head. "Cornerback. I was too small to play quarterback, but I had a mean tackle." He laughed. "I miss those days sometimes, you know? Things were simpler then."

Dana nodded. She missed the days of her youth as well, before she'd seen the darker side of the world.

"I hear you," she said, her voice wistful. "Sometimes I wish I could go back to being that carefree teenager again."

"But then we wouldn't be doing this," Sam said, gesturing to their surroundings. "And we probably wouldn't have met, would we?"

Their eyes met for a moment, and Dana was surprised to feel a flutter in her stomach. There was something alluring about Sam. His sense of humor, his caring nature, and his unwavering support throughout their partnership had forged a strong bond between them—and in moments like these it felt like it might develop into something more than just friendship.

Sam broke the stare, instead gazing ahead through the windshield. "Looks like we're here," he said, pointing. "Don't miss your turn."

Dana, her face feeling a bit warm, moved into the left lane and turned at the light, entering the campus. Miner State College sprawled out before them, its red brick buildings adorned with ivy, giving the campus an air of distinguished academia. The trees lining the pathways were just starting to change color. Students navigated their way through the bustling campus, their laughter and lively discussions creating a hum of energy that was palpable.

Dana drove slowly, taking in the surroundings and mulling over her conversation with Sam.

"Brings back memories, doesn't it?" Sam said, looking around at the vibrant college scene and smiling nostalgically. "I remember spending more time at parties than in the library during my college days. How about you?"

Dana laughed, recalling her own experience. "Couldn't be more different, Sam. I practically lived in the library, poring over law books and political theories. I didn't have much time for parties."

"Ah, so you were one of those students," he teased, nudging her playfully. "But hey, look where that dedication got you. You're one of the best agents out there."

"Thanks, Sam. And your social skills have certainly come in handy on the job as well."

He waved a dismissive hand at her. "I wasn't fishing."

After driving through the campus, Dana found a parking spot near the main building, where she believed Professor Abrams' class would be held. The SUV came to a stop beneath a large oak tree that provided some shade from the sunlight.

As Dana and Sam exited the vehicle and entered the nearest building, Dana immediately noticed the polished marble floors and high ceilings, giving an impression of grandeur. She scanned the hallways for any signs pointing them toward Professor Abrams' classroom but found none.

"Excuse me," Dana said as she approached a young woman sitting on a nearby bench, the woman's fingers tapping away at her laptop. The student looked up, her dark hair tied in a messy bun and thick-rimmed glasses perched on her nose.

"Do you know where we can find Professor Abrams' classroom?" Dana asked.

"Sure," the student replied, pausing her typing to give them directions. "Take the stairs to the second floor, turn left, and it'll be the third classroom on your right."

"Thank you," Dana said, offering a smile before she and Sam headed toward their destination, eager to see if Professor Abrams could provide them with the insight they needed to catch the Constitution Killer.

Dana and Sam climbed the stairs to the second floor, following the student's directions. The hallway was bustling with students rushing to their classes or chatting with friends. As they turned the corner, Dana spotted the third door on the right, a small window revealing the ongoing class within.

Through the window, they watched as Professor Charles Abrams animatedly paced around the room. He was a tall, thin man with graying hair, wearing a tweed jacket with elbow patches. With each point he made, his arms gestured dramatically, captivating the attention of the students in the room.

"Should we interrupt him?" Sam whispered, glancing at Dana.

Dana checked her watch, noting that it was eleven fifty-five. "Let's give it a few more minutes," she suggested. "The class should end soon."

As they waited, Dana observed the professor's teaching style. It was clear he had an infectious passion for the subject, his enthusiasm spreading through the room like wildfire. She hoped this energy would translate into helpful insights for their case.

Just as Dana had predicted, the class ended a few minutes later. Professor Abrams concluded his lecture with a few parting words that Dana couldn't quite make out. The students began gathering their belongings, and Dana and Sam stepped aside to allow them to exit the classroom.

The students who streamed past were diverse, a mixture of ages, genders, and ethnicities. Some chatted excitedly about the lecture, while others seemed relieved that the class was over, already turning their attention to their phones or other obligations.

Once the last of the students had left, Dana and Sam entered the now-empty classroom. They found Professor Abrams at the front of the room, tidying up his notes and wiping the chalkboard clean with practiced efficiency.

"Professor Abrams?" Dana asked.

The professor looked away from his chalkboard, eyebrows raised in curiosity. He appeared to be in his early sixties, with a shock of white hair that contrasted sharply with his deeply tanned skin. His eyes were a piercing blue, framed by crow's feet that hinted at a life full of laughter and deep thought.

"Ah, yes," he said, extending a hand to Dana. "Charles Abrams. How can I help you?"

"Agent Dana Blaze, FBI," she replied, shaking his hand firmly. "And this is my partner, Agent Sam Harris."

"An unexpected visit from the Bureau," Professor Abrams mused, shaking Sam's hand as well. His gaze flicked between the two agents, clearly intrigued. "What brings you to my humble classroom?"

"We've been trying to reach you, Professor," Dana explained. "We're investigating a series of murders here in Philadelphia, and we believe the killer has a fixation on the First Amendment."

"Is that so?" Abrams rubbed his chin thoughtfully, the corners of his mouth tugging upwards. "Well, I must admit, constitutional murder mysteries are not exactly within my purview, but I do enjoy a good intellectual puzzle."

"Then perhaps you can help us make sense of this," Dana said, pulling out her notepad. "So far, three young women, all political activists, have been killed at public events. The cause of death in each case was poisoning by a needle."

"Gruesome," Professor Abrams commented, frowning slightly.

"At each crime scene, the killer left a scrambled quote from the First Amendment,” Dana continued. “Unscrambled, the quotes are 'abridging the freedom of speech,' 'peaceably to assemble,' and 'make no law.'"

"Curious," Abrams murmured, his eyes narrowing as he mentally sifted through the information. "Any ideas on why the killer chose these particular quotes?"

"That's why we're talking to you, professor," Sam said.

"Give me a moment," Professor Abrams said, pacing back and forth in front of the chalkboard as he considered the matter. His fingers tapped rhythmically against his chin as his mind worked tirelessly to unravel the enigma before him.

Dana glanced at Sam, who returned her look with a shrug. They both knew they were grasping at straws, but if there was even the slightest chance that Professor Abrams could provide them with a new lead, they had to take it.

After several long moments of contemplation, the professor stopped pacing and turned back to face them. His eyes sparkled with the unmistakable glint of intellectual challenge, and Dana felt a flicker of hope ignite within her.

"Perhaps," Abrams began, "the killer is making a statement about the erosion of these fundamental rights. The quotes could be his way of highlighting political suppression or the government's intrusion on personal freedoms."

He paused, rubbing his chin again before continuing. "Or maybe it's more personal than that. The victims were all politically active, after all. The killer might see them as symbolically representing the ideals he believes are being violated."

Dana nodded, feigning polite interest, but inwardly she was disappointed. All of this had occurred to her already, and she'd hoped for some new insight.

Then Abrams' eyes lit up with a realization. "In fact, this reminds me of something I came across recently." He opened his laptop and typed rapidly, searching for the information he needed.

"Ah, here it is," he said triumphantly. "There's an online forum called Constitution Crusaders where people discuss their radical interpretations of the Constitution. Some of these individuals have very extremist views, often promoting violent action against the government."

"Violent action?" Sam asked, leaning in to get a closer look at the screen.

"Indeed," Abrams replied, turning the laptop around so they could view the headlines of the forum posts. "For example, this thread discusses the need to overthrow the government by any means necessary, even suggesting that bloodshed is required to ignite a new revolution."

Dana's eyes narrowed as she scanned through the various posts, taking in the intensity of their rhetoric. She noticed one post that detailed how certain politicians should be "silenced" for their infringement upon free speech. Another argued that peaceful assembly was no longer enough to effect change, and that forceful action was the only solution.

Could the killer, Dana wondered, be one of these "Constitutional Crusaders"? 

 

 

 

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
 

 

Dana's eyes scanned the screen of her laptop, studying the social media account of a man named Bert Maddock. He had a scruffy beard and cold, calculating eyes that gave Dana a chill. His posts consisted of angry rants about government overreach, calls for revolution, and disturbingly violent imagery.

One post featured a crudely drawn caricature of a politician with a dagger plunged into his heart, captioned with the chilling words: "The only way to be heard." Dana felt a surge of intrigue as she cautiously delved deeper into his profile.

Dana and Sam were sitting in a cozy booth at a small Italian restaurant in downtown Philadelphia. The warm scent of garlic and herbs hung in the air, mixing with the murmur of conversations nearby. They had just polished off a lunch of homemade pasta with rich marinara sauce, savoring every bite while discussing the forum Professor Abrams had mentioned—Constitution Crusaders.

Sam idly poked at the remnants of his pasta, boredom evident in his slumped shoulders. Dana glanced at him and motioned toward her laptop screen. "Sam, come take a look at this."

He sighed and scooted closer, rubbing tired eyes before focusing on the screen. Dana pointed at the man's profile. "See how he's posing with firearms in almost every picture? And these aggressive captions...it's unsettling."

"He does look like bad news," Sam agreed grudgingly. "What's his connection to the rallies?"

"Look here," Dana said, clicking through the man's photos. "He's been attending a lot of political events, just like our victims. He could be our guy."

"Has he been to any of the rallies where the murders took place?"

"Working on that," she replied, her fingers flying over the keyboard as she scrolled through more of the man's online history. "Wait a minute..." She clicked on another post, revealing vacation pictures of the man in Florida. Her heart sank.

"He's been in Florida for the past two weeks," she said. "These timestamps are proof; he couldn't have been in Philadelphia for the murders."

Another dead end. Dana sank back in her chair, deflated.

	Sam checked his watch and cursed under his breath. "I forgot I was supposed to meet with the chief in ten minutes, give him an update on things." He paused. "Only problem is, we've just got the one vehicle."

Dana looked at him, surprised. "Since when is Michaels in the city?"

"Just flew in."

Michaels must be really worried about this case, Dana thought. Either that or he feels the need to micromanage us.

"Is there a reason I'm not invited to this meeting?" she asked.

Sam glanced away and bit his lip, looking uncomfortable. "It wasn't my idea."

Suddenly, it made sense. Dana clenched her jaw, frustrated at being deliberately cut out. "What's his problem with me, anyway?" she asked. "Does he feel threatened by me? Is it because I'm a woman who's not afraid to stand up for herself?"

"I tried to tell him we're a team," Sam said, diplomatically sidestepping Dana's questions. "But he insisted. Said he didn't want to 'waste your time.'"

Dana grunted. "How generous of him." She reached into her pocket, meaning to dig out the SUV keys, but Sam shook his head suddenly.

"You know what?" he said. "You might need wheels. I'll just take a cab."

"You sure?"

He nodded, already moving away. "Touch base after!" With that, he hurried out of the restaurant.

Alone now in the nearly empty restaurant, Dana's shoulders slumped and her eyes stared blankly at the table. Michaels, she thought, shaking her head bitterly. It was probably for the best, though. The less she saw of him, the better.

What was she supposed to do now, though? Keep looking at that forum, investigating the backgrounds of other users? No, she'd already disqualified the most promising suspects, and besides that, she was tired of staring at the screen. She needed some fresh air.

With a heavy sigh, she pushed herself up from the booth and walked outside, where she climbed into the SUV and started the engine.

As Dana drove aimlessly through the streets of Philadelphia, it occurred to her that she needed a fresh angle, a new way of looking at things. Her mind wandered to Nolan Carver, the seasoned FBI agent who had trained her when she first joined the Bureau.

Over the years of working together, Nolan had become more than just a mentor to Dana—he'd become a close friend. They shared a love for the law, an unwavering commitment to justice, and even the same taste in books. The bond they'd formed during her early years at the Bureau had only grown stronger with time, and she knew she could always turn to him for guidance.

Deciding that speaking to Nolan might help her gain some much-needed perspective, Dana pulled out her phone and dialed his number. As she continued to drive, her thoughts briefly drifted to the last time they had spoken, when Nolan had told her about his retirement plans and his desire to explore new passions outside of law enforcement.

"Hello?" Nolan asked.

"Hey, it's Dana," she said, feeling her spirits lift at the sound of his voice. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything."

"Ah, Dana! Not at all. What can I do for you?"

As they spoke, Dana noticed the faint sounds of birds chirping in the background. The melodic songs were light and uplifting, a pleasant contrast to the heavy weight of the case on her mind. Curious, she asked, "What's with the birds?"

"Ah, I'm in the mountains right now," Nolan explained, his voice full of warmth. "Just me and my camera."

"Really? Photography?" Dana couldn't help but let her surprise show. She had always known Nolan to be an outdoor enthusiast, but she never pegged him as a photographer.

"Absolutely," Nolan replied with enthusiasm. "You know, I've always enjoyed exploring the great outdoors, but taking photographs adds a whole new dimension to the experience. It's not just about being active; it's about capturing the beauty of the world around us in a single frame."

Dana considered his words for a moment, nodding. "That's a lovely way to put it. So, what kind of subjects do you enjoy photographing the most?"

"Landscapes, mostly," he said. "There's something magical about the way light plays on mountains, forests, and rivers. And don't even get me started on sunsets." He chuckled. "But I also enjoy capturing the subtle details: the patterns on a butterfly's wings or the dewdrops on a spider's web."

"Sounds fascinating," Dana murmured, genuinely impressed. She could almost see the images Nolan described through his words.

"Enough about me, though," Nolan said, shifting gears. "I doubt you called to discuss my latest hobby. What's going on, Dana? Is everything alright?"

She hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath. "I'm working on a case, Nolan—a serial killer. And I feel like I've hit a dead end." Her voice trembled slightly, betraying her frustration and exhaustion.

"Tell me more," Nolan said, his tone shifting to one of concern.

"Well, he's taken three lives so far, all of the victims young women who are political activists. He poisons them with a needle at public events, leaving no sign he was there except for a small needle mark—that, and a quote from the First Amendment, a different one with each victim." She paused. "And, if that's not enough, he just left a message at a local newspaper, taunting us."

"Very interesting," Nolan murmured. "What did it say?"

"Nothing of substance. Just that we would never catch him, that he was the real supporter of the Constitution—that kind of thing."

"Any theories so far on why he's doing this?"

Dana sighed. "Not really. I've been going through the usual avenues, trying to track down anyone who may have been at the events or anyone who fits the profile, but I keep hitting dead ends. And now I'm just driving around, hoping for some kind of inspiration."

"I wonder why the killer is so focused on the First Amendment," Nolan mused. "If his goal is to draw attention to the Constitution – to show how he's a true supporter of the Constitution, that is – then why limit himself to one of the Amendments? His quotes should be all over the place, don't you think?"

Dana's eyebrows pulled together in a frown. "I hadn't really thought about that." She sighed. "Honestly, there's probably a lot I'm missing. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now."

Nolan was silent for a moment, and Dana could hear the rustling of leaves in the background.

"Remember the 'Bard' case, Dana?" he asked suddenly.

Dana stared at the road, recalling the serial killer who had repeatedly taunted law enforcement with his rhymes, each one describing the next victim he had selected. The Bard, a high school janitor named Andrew Morgan, had been her first high-profile case as an agent, and the case had tested her resilience at every turn.

"How could I forget?" Dana replied, a shiver running down her spine. "That case nearly drove me insane."

"But it didn't," Nolan said. "You persevered, relentless, piecing together the cryptic poems he left with each victim, refusing to give up. Your intuition and persistence led us straight to him."

"It's not like I did it all by myself," Dana said, coloring a little at the complimentary picture Nolan was painting.

"No, but you were instrumental," he said. "And let's not forget about the other serial killers you've brought to justice since then. My point is that you're more than capable of handling this new case, Dana. Don't doubt yourself."

A small smile formed on Dana's lips, despite the fatigue that weighed her down. Nolan's words rekindled the determination that had been smothered by frustration and exhaustion. She knew he was right; she had faced seemingly insurmountable challenges before, and she would do so again.

"Thank you, Nolan," she said softly, grateful for his unwavering faith in her abilities.

"Of course." He paused for a moment. "You know, you could visit the Bard, maybe try to tap into the criminal mind."

"I don't really have time right now to fly out to California."

"He's not in California. He's at Pennsylvania's Southern Junction Penitentiary."

Dana felt a thrill of unease. She didn't like knowing she was so close to the Bard.

"I'll think about it," she said.

There was a beat of silence. Then Nolan spoke, a note of concern entering his voice. "Dana, I have to ask—are you taking care of yourself? You sound very tired."

"I'm fine," she replied a bit too quickly, brushing off his concern. "Just a little worn out from the case, that's all."

"Listen to me, Dana," Nolan said. "I know how dedicated you are, and I admire that. But remember, you can't help others if you don't take care of yourself first. It's important to prioritize your well-being, even in the midst of a challenging case like this one."

His words struck a chord within her—a reminder of the precarious balance between duty and self-preservation. She knew he was right, but admitting it to herself felt like a small defeat.

"I'll try," she said, not sure whether she meant the words. How was she supposed to prioritize rest when there were lives at stake?

She guided the SUV around a bend, passing a semi truck coming the opposite way. The wind created by the semi caused the SUV to shudder.

"I have to run now," Nolan said apologetically. "Got a photography workshop up here in the mountains I need to attend. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything."

"Will do. Thanks again," Dana said, hanging up the phone.

As the line went dead, Dana found herself thinking about the Bard. She remembered how it had taken a combination of her legal knowledge and her intuition as an investigator to decipher the patterns within the Bard's twisted mind. Ultimately, it had been her understanding of literary symbolism that led her to a breakthrough, catching the Bard during one of his meticulously planned murders.

She wondered if she could glean any insights from her experience with the Bard to help her understand the elusive killer she was currently hunting. Both killers seemed to share an obsession with leaving clues, and both demonstrated a fascination with the same subject matter, albeit to different degrees. Perhaps the key to catching this new killer lay in delving deep into the dark recesses of another disturbed mind.

How is it that Nolan always knows the right thing to say? she wondered.

The Bard was a creep, and Dana didn't relish the thought of seeing his face again. But if that was the cost of catching a killer, so be it.

She entered the prison's address in her GPS. Only twenty minutes away.

"Time to get inside a killer's head," she said to herself, taking the next turn. 

 

 

 

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
 

 

Flanked by four imposing prison guards, Dana felt an uneasy tension knotting in her stomach as she walked down the sterile corridor of Pennsylvania's Southern Junction Penitentiary.

Nothing like being escorted in style, she thought, eyeing the muscular guards surrounding her.

She couldn't help but think back to the day she arrested Andrew Morgan, the man the media had dubbed "the Bard" for his eerily poetic letters taunting law enforcement. As they slapped the cuffs on him, he had looked her dead in the eye and promised that he'd have the last laugh. Now, as they made their way to his cell, she wondered if he'd remember that threat.

The walls of the prison were a lifeless gray, adorned only with the occasional security camera and barred windows that let in slivers of sunlight. The guards escorting her were tall and burly, each armed with a baton and a holstered firearm. They moved with purpose, their boots clipping loudly through the otherwise silent halls.

"Is it really necessary to have so many guards?" Dana asked, brushing a strand of brown hair out of her face.

One of the guards, a man in his forties with a neatly-trimmed mustache, glanced at her. "The Bard is a very dangerous individual, Agent Blaze," he said gruffly, his voice tinged with a mixture of wariness and disdain. "Just last month, he managed to stab one of our guards with a makeshift shiv he'd fashioned from a toothbrush. The poor guy almost bled to death."

Dana swallowed hard, wondering what she'd gotten herself into. Regardless of how dangerous the Bard might be, however, she'd dealt with him before. Besides, she needed answers, and this man – this killer – might hold the key to understanding the madman currently terrorizing Philadelphia.

Within moments they'd reached Morgan's cell, a small, barren space with only a narrow cot, a toilet, and a sink to call its own. The air inside was stale, heavy with the scent of confinement and despair.

Andrew Morgan stood at the back of the cell, his tall, wiry frame pressed against the concrete wall. His once-smooth face was now marred with the passage of time and prison life, but the glint in his icy blue eyes remained unchanged—a testament to the calculating, cunning mind that had evaded capture for so long. He studied Dana with an amused expression, as if her presence was nothing more than a brief respite from the monotony of his days.

Why doesn't he look surprised to see me? Dana wondered. He must have one hell of a poker face.

"Stay where you are, Morgan," ordered the guard with the neatly-trimmed mustache. Morgan held up his hands, a sardonic smile playing on his lips, and said nothing.

With a nod from the senior guard, the heavy metal door creaked open. Two of the guards moved into the room first, securing Morgan to a table in the center with handcuffs and leg restraints. The remaining two positioned themselves strategically around the room, their weapons at the ready should anything go awry.

"Alright, Agent Blaze," said the senior guard, motioning for Dana to enter. "You can speak with him now, but keep your distance. No physical contact, and don't get too close."

"Can I speak with him alone?" Dana asked, trying to maintain her composure despite Morgan's intent gaze.

"Absolutely not," replied the guard firmly. "We cannot risk leaving you alone with him. He's far too dangerous."

Dana nodded, understanding the need for caution. She stepped into the cell, her heart pounding in her chest as she approached the table where Morgan was securely restrained. She couldn't shake the feeling that he held all the cards, despite his captivity.

Dana studied Morgan, trying to push past the unease that washed over her. He hadn't changed much since she last saw him—still tall and lean, his dark hair graying at the temples. His eyes seemed to bore into her soul, a hint of a smile playing at the corners of his lips.

"Long time, no see," Morgan said.

"Not long enough," Dana answered, attempting an air of nonchalance.

Morgan raised an eyebrow. "Hell of a thing to say to a man when you need something from him."

"What makes you think I need anything from you?"

He grinned. "Because you're here, Agent Blaze. Because you're here."

Dana glanced away, hating the feel of his eyes on her. "Why did you taunt the police with those letters?" she asked. "You took a risk, exposing yourself like that. You could still be a free man if you had been more cautious."

Morgan remained silent, his expression unreadable. One of the guards grew impatient and slammed his baton against Morgan's chair. "Answer the lady!" he barked.

Morgan gave the guard a scathing look, then turned his attention back to Dana. "I know you didn't come here just to talk about me. So, tell me, Agent Blaze...what brings you to my humble abode?"

Dana hesitated for a moment, focusing on the steady rhythm of her breathing. She sensed that admitting the truth to Morgan would give him some power over her, and she couldn't afford to do that—not now, not ever. She also sensed, however, that she wouldn't get anything from him so long as he believed she was lying to him.

Dana swallowed the lump in her throat, hesitating to reveal the true purpose of her visit. She felt cornered, but there was no turning back now. Taking a deep breath, she looked Morgan directly in his cold, calculating eyes and said, "I need your help on a case I'm working."

Morgan leaned back in his chair, the metal creaking under his weight. He studied Dana with a predatory intensity, as if he were a wolf examining its prey. The cruel glint in his eyes was unmistakable; he relished her vulnerability, savoring every word she spoke.

"Well, well," he drawled, smirking. "Never thought I'd see the day when Agent Dana Blaze would come groveling to me for assistance."

Ignoring the taunting tone in Morgan's voice, Dana pressed on, her determination outweighing any fear or reservations. "The person I'm looking for has been leaving quotes from the First Amendment at crime scenes," she said. "And this morning, he left a note at the headquarters of a newspaper."

"Really?" Morgan asked, raising an eyebrow. He leaned forward slightly, showing the first sign of genuine interest since she had entered the room. "And what did the note say, pray tell?"

"The note basically stated that the killer has the 'right' to do whatever he wants, and nobody can stop him."

"Ah," Morgan murmured, tapping his fingers on the table, his restraints clinking with each movement. "That is intriguing. A challenge to authority—quite fitting, don't you think? Considering his fascination with the Constitution?"

Dana nodded, hoping Morgan would offer some insight. "Do you have any other thoughts?"

Morgan's face twisted into a sneer. "Don't you have a whole department of FBI agents to help you figure that out?" he asked.

Dana wasn't going to take any more crap from him. "Do you want to go back to staring at the wall? Because I can find someone else to talk to."

Morgan clucked his tongue, shaking his head slowly. "Dana, Dana. You're even more fun than I remember."

"Start talking, Morgan."

"And what do I get in return?"

"What do you want?"

Morgan smirked. "Tell me something about yourself you've never told anyone else.

Dana stared at him, taken aback. "You're asking for a personal secret in exchange for professional aid?"

"Exactly," Morgan said, the corner of his mouth quirking up into an infuriating smirk. His eyes roved over her face, watching her reaction closely.

Dana paused, battling with herself. Every instinct told her not to trust Morgan, not to give him anything. But she also knew she needed his insight. The weight of the case was pressing heavy on her shoulders, and she was running out of time. Swallowing her pride, she stiffened her spine and met Morgan's gaze head-on.

"Fine," she said in a low voice. "When I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut. I dreamed about space instead of princesses and fairy tales. There. That's something I've never told anyone before."

Silence followed her confession, as if the dingy room was holding its breath. Morgan stared at her, his smirk fading.

"An astronaut," he mused, sounding disappointed. "So what stopped you?"

"The realization that my head was better suited for solving puzzles on the ground rather than floating among the stars."

Morgan laughed at that. "That's quite amusing. Still, it's not much of a secret, is it? You're going to have to do better than that if you want my help, Agent Blaze."

Dana clenched her jaw, a flare of anger igniting in her chest. "Look," she said, her words sharp. "If you want me to spill out all my secrets, then you've got another thing coming."

Morgan chuckled, leaning back in his chair with a self-satisfied smirk. "So defensive, Dana. I'm not asking for your deepest, darkest fears. Yet."

He paused, his gaze fixating on her with unsettling intensity. Dana felt like a bug under a microscope, each layer of her being unraveled under his scrutinizing eyes.

"Tell me something real, Dana."

Dana bristled but swallowed her indignation. "All right," she said, her voice husky with suppressed emotion. She took a deep breath, exhaled, and then laid her soul bare. "I've never been in love. Not really." She had been engaged, but that wasn't the same thing.

Morgan's eyes widened briefly before he quickly masked his surprise. He tilted his head to the side, studying Dana as if seeing her in a new light.

"And how does that make you feel? Lonely?"

"No," Dana rebuffed, steeling herself against his gaze. "Focused."

"Hmmm..." Morgan murmured, tapping on the table again. His smirk returned, albeit softer this time around, a glimmer of curiosity in his eyes. "That's more like it."

"Can we get back to the case now?" Dana asked, a hint of irritation punctuating her question.

"We certainly can," Morgan conceded, leaning back against his chair as his shackles clinked against the table. His eyes were locked on Dana, an odd glint in them that gave her a slight pause. He seemed...pleased. Not just for their progress in the case, but for something else entirely—something that made Dana shiver in apprehension.

A thoughtful expression came over Morgan's face as he tapped his fingers on the table, the restraints clinking softly. "Messages," he murmured. "There is power in words, Agent Blaze. I sent my own letters to the police because it reminded them of their inadequacy. It created fear and chaos. And as we both know, there's something undeniably...satisfying in that."

Dana gritted her teeth, forcing herself to remain composed. She couldn't let Morgan see how much he unnerved her. "And the killer I'm hunting? Why do you think he's leaving quotes from the First Amendment?"

"Ah, yes." A slow, sinister smile spread across Morgan's face. "The First Amendment—freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, and petition. It seems your killer is trying to send a message about the nature of freedom and power. Perhaps they believe they are above the law, that their actions are justified by some twisted interpretation of these rights."

"Or perhaps they're trying to provoke the authorities, baiting them into action," Dana added, her mind racing as she considered the possibilities.

"Exactly." Morgan's eyes sparkled with dark amusement. "It's a game, Agent Blaze. Just like the one we played. But this time, your killer has upped the stakes. And it seems you're the one who has to play."

Before Dana could respond, the guard with the neatly-trimmed mustache stepped forward, his voice firm. "Time's up, Agent Blaze. We need to keep to the schedule."

"Wait," Dana protested. "I have more questions."

"Sorry, but we can't make an exception," the guard said, his expression resolute. "We need to maintain order and control here."

Dana took a deep breath, her frustration boiling beneath the surface. She knew he was right, but it didn't make leaving any easier.

"Very well," she said, rising from her seat. The guards quickly escorted her out of the cell, uncuffed Morgan, and closed the heavy steel door behind her.

"Tick-tock, tick-tock," Morgan said in a sing-song voice. "Soon another body will drop! And who will the guilty person be? Why, Dana Blaze! Goodness, me!"

Morgan's sinister laughter followed Dana as she was led away by the guards. The cold echo of his voice reverberated off the prison walls, sending a shiver down her spine. She gritted her teeth and clenched her fists, trying to ignore the burning anger within her.

"Remember what I told you, Agent Blaze?" Morgan shouted after her, smirking. "I'd get the last laugh, and it looks like I'm still laughing!"

"Ignore him," the guard with the neatly-trimmed mustache urged, his hand on Dana's shoulder. "The man's a lunatic."

Dana nodded, but inwardly, Morgan's words stung. And worst of all, she couldn't think of anything useful she'd gleaned from speaking with him. Had this whole trip been a waste?

As they reached the end of the corridor, Dana's phone rang. She quickly pulled it from her pocket, glancing at the caller ID. It was Sam.

"Where are you?" Sam asked as he answered, his voice tense. "There's been another murder."

"I'm at Southern Junction Penitentiary," Dana said, wondering what was going on. "I was just talking to Andrew Morgan, trying to get some insight into this case. Why?"

"I know right where you can get some fresh insight," Sam said in a low voice. "On the front steps of city hall, where the latest victim's body is." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER NINETEEN
 

 

Dana's heart sank as she pulled up to city hall, the site of the latest murder.

Not again, she thought.

The scene before her was a chaotic mix of flashing lights from police cruisers and the ever-present yellow caution tape cordoning off the area. Spectators had gathered behind the barriers, gawking at the gruesome sight—a crumpled body covered with a white sheet, sprawled out on the steps. A heavy feeling settled in Dana's chest, a mixture of guilt and despair. She felt like she had let this woman down by not catching the killer sooner.

"Get it together, Blaze," she mumbled to herself, taking a deep breath as she parked her car. "You can't save everyone."

As Dana exited the vehicle, Sam approached, looking grave. He gave her a brief nod before gesturing toward the white sheet. "That's Kim Nguyen," he said. "She was giving a speech about community outreach when someone injected her with the same substance as the other victims. There's a needle mark on her arm."

"Damn it," Dana muttered, clenching her fists at her sides. She felt a pang of anger welling up inside her, but also a renewed determination to find the person responsible for these heinous crimes. If it took every ounce of her strength and every last bit of her intellect, she would bring the killer to justice.

"No more political gatherings," Dana said, looking at Sam. "We've got to stop them until we catch whoever is doing this."

Sam gave her a dubious expression. "Michaels isn't going to like it."

"I don't care what Michaels likes. If temporarily banning these gatherings saves a single life, it's worth it."

Sam nodded, his eyes telling her he knew better than to argue. "I'll make the call." He pulled out his phone and began tapping the screen, taking a few steps away.

"Thank you," Dana said.

The sun hung high in the sky, casting stark shadows across the steps of city hall as Dana studied the faces of the onlookers. She searched for any sign of recognition or guilt, but they all seemed to be united in their shock and horror at the senseless loss of life. The air was crisp with the promise of an early autumn, carrying the distant scent of decaying leaves.

A few moments later, Sam put his phone away and sighed. "I talked to the mayor, and he seemed to understand the urgency. He's going to make it happen as quickly as possible."

"Good," Dana said, nodding. She cleared her throat, turning her attention back to the crime at hand. "So what about this murder? Any leads so far? Physical evidence? Witnesses?"

"Nothing," Sam replied, his voice heavy with frustration. "No witnesses, no physical evidence. We haven't found a quote from the First Amendment, either."

Dana furrowed her brow, surprised by this revelation. The killer had left quotes from the First Amendment near the other victims, so why not now? Was it possible that they were dealing with a copycat? Or maybe the killer was trying to throw them off course?

"Are you ready to see the body?" Sam asked, pulling her from her thoughts.

Dana's stomach churned at the prospect, but she nodded, steeling herself for what lay ahead. "Let's do it."

Together, they ascended the city hall steps, moving past the uniformed officers and forensic technicians working diligently at the scene. As they approached, Dana could see Kim Nguyen's body draped with a white sheet, preserving her modesty even in death.

Sam gently pulled back the sheet, revealing Kim's face. She looked remarkably unchanged, almost peaceful, as though she might be sleeping rather than lying lifeless on the cold stone steps. Her raven-black hair framed her delicate features, and her dark eyes were closed, hiding the intelligence and determination that had once shone through them.

Dana took a deep breath, swallowing the lump in her throat. It was hard to reconcile this image of tranquility with the brutal reality of Kim's murder. She had been taken from the world too soon, and Dana couldn't help but feel that she had let her down by not catching the killer sooner.

Composing herself, Dana opened her eyes again and studied Kim's body more closely, noting the lack of any visible injuries or signs of struggle. Frustration gnawed at her as she searched for any evidence the killer may have left behind. In her mind, she knew that if this was indeed the work of the same killer who had left quotes from the First Amendment near his other victims, there should be something here.

"I don't understand," she muttered under her breath, scanning the area around the body once more before turning her attention back to Kim herself. "Where's the quote?"

"Maybe the killer ran out of time," Sam suggested. "He could've gotten spooked."

Dana slipped on a pair of gloves. As she was examining the needle mark on Kim's arm, her hand brushed against something in Kim's pocket, causing a faint rustling sound. A flicker of hope ignited within her, and she carefully reached into the pocket to retrieve the hidden item. As she pulled out a small, folded piece of paper, she realized it was yet another quote from the First Amendment, just like those found with the previous victims.

She glanced briefly at the quote, unscrambling the letters in mere seconds.

"What does it say?" Sam asked.

"'Redress of grievances.'" Dana's heart was heavy as she stared down into Kim's lifeless eyes. "Sooner or later," she promised Kim in a low voice, "there will be a redress of your grievances—no matter what it takes. On that, you have my word."

 

*   *   *

 

Dana's fingers clenched the crumpled quote from the First Amendment, her expression a mixture of frustration and disgust. With a swift motion, she threw it onto the desk before her.

"What a sick game," she muttered, rubbing her temples as if to ward off an impending headache.

The temporary office Dana and Sam had set up at the local police station was cramped, with stacks of files piled haphazardly on desks and chairs. Sunlight filtered through the blinds, casting shadows across the room.

Dana sat in front of a small desk, her dark hair pulled back into a tight ponytail, while Sam leaned against a nearby wall, leafing through their suspect list, which they had gathered by searching for anyone even remotely suspicious in the backgrounds of the victims as well as others who had nothing to do with the victims—a student who had been arrested for graffiting anarchic statements on a public building, a lawyer who had gotten into a bar fight over the meaning of the Eighth Amendment's "cruel and unusual punishments" phrase, and other even less promising characters.

"What do you think the quote means?" Sam asked, sounding a bit bored as he turned the page.

Dana frowned, her eyes clouded with uncertainty. "I think it means our killer is obsessed with the First Amendment. Maybe he's trying to make some twisted point about freedom of speech or something."

Just then, Sam's phone rang. He answered quickly, his brow furrowing as he listened intently to the person on the other end. "That's great news," he said, a note of relief in his voice. "Thanks for the update. We'll be in touch."

As he hung up, he looked at Dana with a glimmer of hope in his eyes. "The toxicology results came back from the lab."

"Tell me," Dana said, leaning forward in anticipation.

"According to the report, the killer injected his victims with a rare poison called tetrodotoxin. It's found in some species of pufferfish and can be lethal even in small doses. The poison would've killed the victims quickly, without leaving any outward signs of trauma."

"Where could he have gotten it?" Dana asked, her mind racing as she tried to piece together this new information. "It's not exactly something you pick up at your local pharmacy. If we can find the poison, we'll find the killer."

Sam sighed and rubbed his face wearily. "That's just it. We can't track it because it's not legally sold in the United States. The only way to obtain it is through illegal means, like the black market."

Dana's frustration deepened, but she refused to give up. "Then we start looking into the black market. We have to find where this killer got the poison from."

Sam stared at her, looking hesitant.

"What?" Dana asked. "Do you have a better idea?"

"Yes," he said. "We look into Kim Nguyen's background, see if there are any suspicious characters. If that doesn't pan out, I'm more than happy to make some calls and see if we can't figure out who's been selling tetrodotoxin on the black market, and more importantly, who their recent customers were."

Dana nodded, on board with this plan. Before she could begin digging into Kim's past, however, her phone rang. She glanced at the screen and saw that it was Agent Michaels, her boss.

"I've got to take this," she said to Sam. She rose and stepped out into the hallway, bracing herself for the conversation ahead.

"Michaels," she answered, her voice steady despite the knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. Talking with her boss never seemed to go well.

"What the hell is going on?" demanded Michaels, his impatience evident from the get-go. "I told you I wanted frequent updates on this case, so why haven't I heard from you?"

"I apologize for not being more communicative," Dana replied, clenching her free hand into a fist. "The good news is we're making progress. We just found out that the killer used tetrodotoxin to poison his victims. It's a substance found in a number of fish and land animals, notably pufferfish—"

"Pufferfish?" Michaels cut her off, his voice rising in anger. "You think I called to hear you educate me on pufferfish? I need results, Blaze! Real progress! The mayor is breathing down my neck, demanding answers!"

Dana gritted her teeth, trying to keep her frustration in check. "We're doing everything we can, sir. We're exploring new leads as we speak."

"Maybe your best isn't good enough," he snapped, the words stinging like a slap to Dana's face. "I want you and Sam to have a suspect in custody soon, or else I'll have to consider handing this investigation over to someone else."

"That really won't be necessary—" Dana began, but she was cut off again as the line went dead. 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWENTY
 

 

Michaels' threatening words echoed in Dana's mind as she sat across from Sam, staring out the windshield at a derelict building in a rundown part of Philadelphia. That building was the home of their latest suspect, a man named Milo Zimmerman. In addition to being a registered sex offender who had stalked their latest victim, Kim Nguyen, Milo had also posted some rather suggestive comments on Emily Haven's profile, and Dana had noticed a figure in the crowd at one of Petra Delgado's rallies that looked suspiciously like Zimmerman.

As far as political views, Zimmerman had created a number of fake profiles online to decry the many ways the government was failing to uphold the Constitution, suggesting that perhaps Zimmerman's political stance was just an excuse for carrying out his murderous designs.

Despite all these red flags, however, Dana still found herself stuck on Michaels' words.

He was just venting, she told herself. He didn't mean it.

But was that really true? Could she bank on that?

She understood that Michaels was under immense pressure, with the mayor breathing down his neck for answers, but it didn't excuse the way he treated her. It felt like a constant battle just to prove herself, even after all her accomplishments and dedication to her work.

"Hey," Sam said gently, as if sensing Dana's turmoil. "You alright?"

Dana sighed, tearing her gaze away from the decrepit building. "Yeah," she lied, offering a weak smile. "Just… Michaels. You know how he can be."

Sam nodded sympathetically, his hazel eyes filled with understanding. He knew all too well the toll that their boss's impatience could take on Dana. "Don't let him get to you," he said. "We'll figure this out. We always do."

"Thanks, Sam." Dana appreciated his support more than she could say. In the face of adversity, their partnership had always been her anchor. Together, they had overcome countless obstacles and solved some of the most complex cases the FBI had ever seen.

Dana's gaze returned to the derelict building, its crumbling bricks and shattered windows a stark contrast to the autumn sunlight filtering through the trees around them. "Are we sure he's here?" she asked. "He could be at work or something."

"Actually, I did some digging," Sam replied. "Turns out Milo doesn't have a job. According to his parole officer, he spends most of his time holed up in there."

"Doing what?" Dana asked. "Surely he doesn't actually live here."

Sam shrugged, a mischievous look in his eye. "Isn't that what makes our jobs so much fun? Finding the answers to questions like that?"

Rolling her eyes, Dana opened the car door and stepped out, inhaling the crisp air as she tried to calm her nerves. Together, she and Sam walked toward the decaying building, each step loud in the silent street.

A woman with unkempt hair and a tattered coat appeared from around a corner, moving toward the building with her shoulders hunched. Her eyes darted furtively about, as if expecting trouble at any moment. The thin, frail frame beneath her oversized clothing hinted at a life of hardship.

"Looks like a drug house," Dana murmured to Sam as the woman slipped inside the building. "I don't think someone like our killer, who can blend in so well with crowds, would live here."

"Or," Sam said, "it could be the perfect place for him to hide. Low profile, plenty of distractions. It's worth checking out."

Dana nodded, knowing he was right. They needed to exhaust every lead, especially considering Milo Zimmerman's connection to Kim Nguyen.

Dana knocked on the door, but there was no reply. Strains of low music seeped through the cracks, blending with muffled voices from within. She exchanged a glance with Sam before pushing the door open, steeling herself for whatever lay beyond.

The scene that greeted them was straight out of a nightmare. A haze of smoke hung heavy in the air, carrying the acrid scent of burnt plastic and chemicals. Bodies sprawled across the floor and dilapidated furniture, some twitching in the throes of a high while others lay motionless.

Dana's instincts screamed at her to leave this godforsaken place, but she knew they couldn't afford to dismiss any potential leads. If Milo Zimmerman was hiding here, they had to find him.

The pair moved cautiously through the dimly lit room, stepping over discarded needles and avoiding the dazed stares of the inhabitants. Dana couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for these lost souls trapped in a cycle of addiction and despair. The desperation hanging in the air was palpable, each person lost within their own private hell.

"Excuse me," Dana called out to a gaunt woman slumped against the wall, her glassy eyes staring into nothingness. "We're looking for Milo Zimmerman. Have you seen him?"

The woman didn't respond, seemingly oblivious to her surroundings. Dana sighed and moved on, her frustration mounting as she tried to make sense of this chaotic underworld.

"Hey, have you seen a guy named Milo Zimmerman?" Sam asked a young man with sunken cheeks and hollow eyes. The man mumbled something unintelligible and drifted back into his stupor.

"Damn it," Dana muttered under her breath, feeling like they were chasing ghosts. But just as she was about to give up hope, a deep voice interrupted their search.

"Looking for Milo? That would be me."

Dana spun around to find herself face-to-face with a tall, balding man sporting a faded tattoo of the Constitution on his left forearm. His eyes were clear and alert, standing in stark contrast to the dazed expressions surrounding them. He exuded an air of calm confidence, almost as if he had been expecting them.

"Mr. Zimmerman," Dana said, trying to keep her voice steady. "I'm Agent Dana Blaze, and this is my partner, Agent Sam Harris. We'd like to ask you a few questions."

Zimmerman arched an eyebrow, seemingly unfazed by their presence. "Well, I don't have much of a choice, do I?"

"Can you tell us what you're doing here?" Dana asked, trying to gauge his reaction.

"Finding affordable housing in the city isn't exactly easy," Zimmerman replied with a shrug, his eyes flickering around the room.

Sam couldn't resist chiming in. "I can imagine it's even harder when you're a registered sex offender."

At that, Milo's façade of nonchalance wavered, and he shifted uncomfortably on his feet. "That was a long time ago," he muttered defensively. "I served my time."

"Careful," Dana thought, shooting her partner a glance. "Don't spook him."

"We'd like to speak with you about Kim Nguyen," she said to Zimmerman. "You two were friends at one point, is that correct?"

"I hardly knew her," he replied defensively, his voice cracking slightly. "Look, I've got to go." He glanced at the door, then back at Dana, who stood between him and his escape route.

"Mr. Zimmerman," Dana said, "all we want is for you to answer a few questions. We're trying to get to the bottom of this situation, and your cooperation would be greatly appreciated."

Zimmerman hesitated for a moment, his eyes darting back and forth between Dana and Sam. Then he lowered his face into his hands, sighing heavily as if in defeat. "Alright," he said. "Where do you want to talk?"

"If you would just come with us," Dana began, but before she could finish, Zimmerman lowered his hands and raced straight at her, shoving her and sending her stumbling into a nearby wall. He made a break for the door, desperation etched across his face.

Sam wasted no time in reacting to Zimmerman's sudden escape attempt. He lunged at Milo just as he reached the door.

"Gotcha!" Sam grunted as he wrapped his arms around Zimmerman's waist, tackling him to the ground with a thud.

Dana, still reeling from being shoved aside, shook off the shock and sprang into action, her heart pounding in her ears. She rushed to Sam's side, noting the beads of sweat forming on her partner's brow as he struggled to keep a squirming Zimmerman pinned down.

"Get off me!" Zimmerman yelled, his face contorted with fear and anger. His body writhed beneath Sam's weight, but it was clear that he wasn't going anywhere.

"Stay still," Dana commanded, her voice cold and authoritative. She knelt down beside them, pulled out her handcuffs, and clapped them around Zimmerman's wrists.

"I didn't hurt her, okay?" Zimmerman shouted. "You've got the wrong guy!"

"Oh, yeah?" Sam said in a low voice as he pulled Zimmerman to his feet. "If you're innocent, you sure have a funny way of showing it."

 

*   *   *

 

Dana had one hand on Zimmerman's arm as she escorted him into the precinct when an office door opened and Michaels strode out, his face grim and set.

"Who's this?" he asked abruptly.

"This is Milo Zimmerman," Dana said, caught off-guard. Then, sensing Michaels had more to say, she signaled for Sam to go on ahead of her and escort Zimmerman to the interrogation room.

"He's a registered sex offender who stalked Kim Nguyen," she went on as Zimmerman moved out of earshot. "He also posted some troubling comments on Emily Haven's social media profile and has some hardline political ideas when it comes to the Constitution."

Michaels nodded, his eyes glazed as if he wasn't quite listening. "Good work, Agent Blaze, but I'm afraid a decision's already been made."

"A decision?" Dana stared at him, puzzled. "You said to bring in a suspect, and—"

Just then, a tall agent in a crisp suit strode out of the office, glancing around with an air of authority.

"This is Agent Strickland," Michaels said. "He'll be conducting the interview of the suspect once you get him up to speed."

Dana could hardly believe what she was hearing. "With all due respect, sir—"

Michaels cut her off. "It's been a taxing case already, so it just makes sense to share the load. Wouldn't want you getting burned out." He chuckled, but there was no humor in the sound.

Dana wanted to protest, but she could tell from the look in Michaels' eyes that it wouldn't go well. This was a fight she was not going to win. 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWENTY ONE
 

 

Dana simmered with frustration as she stared through the one-way mirror, her gaze unwavering as she watched Agent Strickland interrogate Milo Zimmerman.

That should be me in there, she thought.

Beside Dana, Sam shifted uncomfortably in his chair, his expression tense. Michaels had warned Dana and Sam that he wanted a suspect in custody soon, and they had fulfilled that demand. Dana suspected, however, that Michaels had just been looking for an excuse to sideline her.

Heaven forbid I should get any credit.

To add insult to injury, Michaels' now loomed behind them, his presence a silent shadow of judgment. Dana could practically feel the weight of his scrutiny.

The interrogation room was small and narrow, the only source of light coming from a single overhead bulb that cast an uneven glow on Milo Zimmerman's pale face. Agent Strickland, broad-shouldered and with a stern expression, leaned forward across the table, his hands clasped together as he scrutinized Zimmerman intently. The FBI agent's graying hair was cropped short, and his piercing blue eyes seemed to bore into Zimmerman's very soul.

"Let's talk about Kim Nguyen, shall we?" Strickland began. "You were friends once, isn't that right?"

Zimmerman shifted uncomfortably in his chair, beads of sweat forming on his brow. "Yeah," he muttered reluctantly. "We were friends. That's all it was, though."

"But then things went sour, didn't they?" Strickland continued, pushing harder. "She rejected you, and you didn't take that well, did you? You started stalking her, obsessing over her every move."

"Look, I was angry, okay?" Zimmerman snapped, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape. "But I never hurt her!"

"Ah, but the poison used by our killer is quite rare, Mr. Zimmerman," Strickland said, leaning in even closer. "And as it turns out, you have access to that very same substance through your work at the aquarium, don't you?"

Zimmerman's face paled further, his eyes widening in fear. "That doesn't mean I used it!" he protested, but there was a tremor in his voice that betrayed his growing panic.

Michaels let out a low chuckle. "Looks like you two might have hit a home run after all," he said, sounding pleased as he clapped his hands on Dana's and Sam's shoulders. "We can tie him to both Nguyen and Haven, and it's only a matter of time before we figure out his connections with the other two. Congratulations on a job well done."

This was Michaels' magnanimous persona, the way he acted when he was performing for someone else—Sam, in this case. Dana doubted he would've been so cheerful if she'd been the only person in the room with him.

She needed to set that grievance aside, however. What mattered most was the case.

Her jaw tightened as she continued to watch the interrogation unfold. Something about Zimmerman's reaction left her feeling uneasy. "I don't think we've really proven anything," she said quietly, voicing her doubts. "Just because he had access to the poison doesn't mean anything by itself. It's circumstantial."

"Come on, Blaze," Michaels chided, his tone dismissive. "He was harassing two of the victims, and we have a picture of him at a third victim's rally."

"It looks that way," Dana corrected. "It's not clear. It could be someone else."

"Regardless, where there's smoke, there's fire." He smiled at Dana in a way that was both paternal and patronizing. "Don't overthink things. You've done your part; now it's time to take a break. Get some rest." With that, he turned and left the room, leaving Dana and Sam in silence.

Dana took a deep breath and let it out slowly, relieved that Michaels was no longer looking over her shoulder. She felt Sam's eyes on her.

"You really think he's innocent?" Sam asked.

Dana pressed her lips together as she weighed her answer. "I don't know," she said. "He's suspicious, for sure…" She trailed off, unsure exactly how to voice her doubts. It was more a gut feeling than anything else.

"I think a jury will buy it."

Dana stared at her partner, surprised. "You sound just like Michaels. Which is more important, putting someone behind bars or getting a killer off the streets?"

"Both," Sam said dryly, his brow furrowed as he continued to watch Strickland grill Zimmerman. "Fortunately for us, I don't think we have to choose between the two."

Dana crossed her arms. "His behavior doesn't match the profile, Sam."

"And what profile is that? The one in your head?"

"Look at him." Dana gestured at the mirror. "The person we're after is cunning, methodical—someone who always seems to be a step ahead of us. Zimmerman, on the other hand, has shown nothing but impulsivity and desperation." She paused, her eyes narrowing as she studied the man in question. "He may very well have wanted to hurt Kim, but is he really the kind of guy who'd sneak up on her and jab her with a needle?"

Sam was silent for a few moments. Then he turned and placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Whatever the case, Michaels has made his decision, so it's out of our hands now. You've done your part. Just take the boss's advice and get some rest for once."

Dana nodded reluctantly, but her dark eyes remained fixed on Zimmerman through the one-way mirror. He seemed small and pathetic, hunched over in the interrogation room—very much unlike the killer she'd imagined.

"Is it possible I'm wrong?" she wondered. "Could I be totally off base?"

With a sigh, Sam gave her shoulder a final squeeze before leaving her alone with her thoughts. Dana waited a few moments to compose her thoughts. Then she, too, left the room.

Stepping out into the hallway, Dana glanced at the clock on the wall—noon already. Sunlight filtered through the windows, casting a warm glow on the bustling police station. She could hear laughter up ahead, and the sound drew her closer.

Michaels stood with a group of officers, his stern expression momentarily replaced by a grin. "So I told him, 'That's not how you handcuff a suspect; that's how you make a pretzel!'" The officers roared with laughter, their mirth reverberating down the hall.

Sam, standing close to Michaels, noticed Dana and waved her over. The smile on his face suggested he was trying to put the tension between them aside. But Dana wasn't in the mood for camaraderie or jokes. She waved him off and slipped into another room, closing the door behind her with a quiet click.

Dana stood in the dark conference room, her gaze fixated on the case files strewn across the table. The sound of laughter from the hallway outside seemed distant and hollow as she mulled over the details of the investigation. She clenched her fists, her knuckles turning white with determination.

"I won't rest until I know for sure," she whispered, vowing not to let the case go until she was convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that they had the right man in custody. 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWENTY TWO
 

 

The man sipped his coffee with measured calm, staring across the bustling cafe at a young woman sitting at a nearby table, surrounded by friends. The sunlight filtered through the cafe's windows, casting golden highlights on her dark hair and illuminating her delicate features. Her laughter was soft and melodic, like the tinkling of wind chimes, and her eyes sparkled with an innocent joy that both intrigued and infuriated the man.

Maria Alvarez, the man thought as he took another sip of his coffee, studying her intently. He admired the way she gestured animatedly while chatting with her friends, the easy grace of her movements. There was something undeniably alluring about her, which only served to fuel his obsession further.

Maria was a journalist—passionate, ambitious, and unafraid to tackle controversial issues. She frequented this cafe several times a week, often meeting friends to discuss the latest news or simply to unwind. Her laugh was infectious, a melodious sound that drew attention from everyone around her.

For weeks, the man had been watching Maria—observing her habits, learning her schedule, and even eavesdropping on her conversations when he could. He'd become so familiar with her routine that it felt like he knew her intimately, even though they'd never spoken. Today, however, he would change that. Today, he planned to introduce himself in a way she would never forget.

As the man contemplated his upcoming meeting with Maria, a bell tinkled, announcing the arrival of a new patron. A uniformed police officer entered the cafe, and the man's body stiffened involuntarily.

His heart raced as paranoid thoughts filled his mind. Had they discovered his connection to the murders? Were they closing in on him even now?

He watched the officer out of the corner of his eye, trying to maintain a facade of calmness. Glancing toward the window, he spotted a van parked along the busy city street. Sweat beaded on his forehead as he wracked his brain, trying to recall if the van had been there when he arrived. The uncertainty gnawed at him, making it difficult to breathe.

"Get a grip," he thought to himself, forcing down the panic that threatened to overwhelm him. "You've been careful. There's no way they could've found you yet."

The officer ordered a coffee and casually chatted with the barista, showing no signs of suspicion or urgency. Or was that all part of the act, intended only to disarm the man into thinking he was safe?

His leg began to bounce in agitation. His eyes stole to the exit, and he imagined himself racing out onto the street. That would certainly draw attention, but if he'd already been identified…

As the man considered what to do, the officer dropped a few bills into the tip jar and made his way toward the exit. As the door closed behind the officer, the man's tense muscles relaxed somewhat—it seemed that the police hadn't caught up to him yet, after all. He couldn't help but let out a small sigh of relief as he watched the police car drive away down the busy city street.

"Why did I ever imagine they'd be able to catch me?" he thought, feeling a renewed sense of confidence in his own ability to avoid detection.

Just as the man allowed himself a brief moment of respite, however, he noticed that Maria was getting up from her seat, preparing to leave the cafe. The man's heart skipped a beat—he couldn't let her slip away now. Trying not to draw attention to himself, he hastily got up and headed for the door, ensuring his gaze wasn't fixed on Maria as he did so.

Once outside, he spotted Maria walking down the city street, engrossed in a conversation on her cell phone. Keeping a safe distance, the man followed her like a shadow, trying his best not to look suspicious. He pretended to be focused on his own phone, occasionally stopping to adjust his jacket or look in shop windows as if browsing.

"Stay calm," he reminded himself. "Just blend in. Nobody knows what you've done or what you're about to do."

As he trailed her, the man couldn't help but marvel at how innocently Maria seemed to trust the world around her. She appeared completely unaware of his sinister intentions, walking confidently and unguarded in broad daylight as if no harm could befall her. It only fueled his desire to claim her as his next victim, an innocent lamb led to the slaughter by her own naivety.

"Get ready, Maria," the man thought, his fingers twitching with anticipation. "You have no idea what's coming."

As the man continued to follow Maria, his curiosity grew. Where was she going? He racked his brain, recalling every detail he'd learned about her routine over the past few weeks. Was she returning to work at the small office where she and a few friends ran their cute little civics magazine?

"No," he thought, glancing at a street sign and suddenly realizing exactly where he was. "Her home is only a few blocks away. Must've given herself the rest of the afternoon off."

Just then, Maria turned and cut through an alley, still talking animatedly on her phone. The alleyway was narrow, flanked by brick walls adorned with graffiti and grime. A shiver of anticipation shot through the man—it was the perfect opportunity. The isolation of the alley would make it so much easier to strike.

His fingers brushed against the needle concealed in his pocket, its deadly contents ready for use. But even as he contemplated making his move, a voice in the back of his mind warned him against it. There was too great a risk that someone might walk by and see what was happening. He couldn't afford any mistakes.

"Patience," the man told himself, clenching his fist around the needle. "Wait for the right moment."

He took a deep breath, feeling the cold autumn air fill his lungs, and forced himself to keep a safe distance from Maria. Each step she took farther into the alley tightened the noose around his craving, but the man knew better than to give in to temptation at the wrong time.

"Trust your instincts," he repeated in his head like a mantra, his eyes never leaving Maria as she emerged from the alley and continued down the sidewalk. He would strike when the moment was right.

Maria finally reached the front door of her house, her keys jingling in her trembling hand as she fumbled to find the right one. The man hid behind a parked car a short distance away, his eyes scanning the quiet street and the surrounding houses for any potential witnesses. He knew this wasn't his ideal location—he preferred attacking his victims in public places, where the thrill of being caught heightened his satisfaction and made a very obvious statement. But now, with Maria having canceled the speaking event where he'd planned to make his move (he could thank the FBI for that little hiccup), desperation gnawed at him like a relentless hunger.

He clenched the needle tightly in his pocket, its deadly contents waiting to be unleashed. He couldn't wait any longer; he had to act. With every passing second, he grew more convinced that he could get to Maria here, undetected, and escape before anyone noticed what had happened.

"Time to finish what I started," he whispered to himself, his heart pounding fiercely in his chest.

Seizing the opportunity, the man sprang from his hiding spot and rushed toward Maria. His plan was simple: jab her with the needle and pretend it had been an accident, all while wearing a mask of innocent concern. But as he neared her, something alerted Maria to his presence, and she turned just in time to see him closing in.

"Stay away from me!" she screamed, her eyes wide with terror as she stared at the needle.

The sound shattered the calm afternoon air like a hammer on glass, surely alerting anyone within earshot. Panicked, the man abandoned any pretense of innocence and lunged forward, backing Maria against the front door of her home. He loomed over her, the needle held menacingly in his hand.

Just before he could plunge the needle, however, Maria kicked out, her shin connecting with his groin. The man let out a pained grunt, doubling over involuntarily as the sharp and sudden pain radiated through his body. His grip slackened on the needle, which clattered uselessly onto the concrete.

Maria tried to slip past him. The man, however, reached out an arm, tackling her to the ground. She was screaming, swiping at his face with her fingernails like a wild animal as the man's hand pawed blindly around for the needle. Where was the damn thing? Instead his hand closed around a loose brick and, without thinking, he clubbed the side of Maria's head just to get her to shut up.

Maria fell instantly silent. There was blood on the brick. Was she dead? No, he didn't think so—just unconscious.

He rose, casting a quick glance around to make sure nobody was watching – he was still in the clear, fortunately – and then located the needle and snatched it up. All he had to do was plunge the needle into Maria's arm and then get out of here as quickly as possible.

But he hesitated. It wasn't supposed to go this way—none of it should have gone this way.

"What do I do, what do I do?" he thought, growing panicked. He liked having a plan, being prepared for any exigency, but this…

Suddenly, he came to a decision. "I'll just have to take her, then leave her somewhere else, somewhere public."

Capping the needle and returning it to his pocket, he slipped one hand beneath Maria's legs and the other behind her shoulders. He hefted her, surprised how light she was.

It would take time to figure out the location...but until then, he would just have to keep her on ice.

"Looks like you're coming home with me", he thought as he staggered away from Maria's front door. 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWENTY THREE
 

 

"There's got to be something here," Dana muttered, scanning the profiles spread out on the table before her.

Four. That was how many lives the killer had taken so far. Julia Bennett, Emily Haven, Petra Delgado, and Kim Nguyen. They were all young women in their twenties passionate about civics and political activism, but otherwise they had very little in common. Their ethnicities were different, their hair color, their eyes. In many cases, serial killers targeted victims – usually women – who looked alike, suggesting the killer was focused on punishing or getting revenge on someone from his or her past.

But no such physical similarities existed here. So why was the killer targeting them? The obvious answer was that it was because of their political activism...but that didn't explain everything.

The words of Nolan Carver, her friend and mentor, echoed in her head. I wonder why the killer is so focused on the First Amendment. If his goal is to draw attention to the Constitution – to show how he's a true supporter of the Constitution, that is – then why limit himself to one of the Amendments?

She still had no answer to that question. She tapped her fingers along the edge of the table, thinking.

Next, it was the words of Andrew Morgan, the infamous "Bard," that haunted her mind: I sent my own letters to the police because it reminded them of their inadequacy. It created fear and chaos.

The Bard, as Dana well knew, hadn't ultimately sent letters to the police because he genuinely wanted any meaningful change. No, it had simply been a way to get attention, to put himself in the limelight, to get the police scratching their heads and trying to figure him out while he laughed from whatever dark hole he was hiding in.

Was it possible this killer was doing the same thing—leaving all the quotes and the note just to distract the investigators?

"No," Dana thought. "It's too well-planned. Someone very intelligent, and very motivated, planned this all out a long time ago, and now they're making a statement."

As Dana pondered this connection, her gaze fell on Emily Haven's journal. She picked it up again and began reading at random, coming across political statements, early drafts of speeches, aspirations for the future, even recipes.

Then she came across the entry in which Emily talked about the "creep" she'd seen around town numerous times, as well as at one of her rallies. Emily had written that she'd encountered this stranger throughout her routine: at the grocery store, the library, and the park.

Unfortunately, this wasn't much to go on—there was no physical description, and the locations were common enough that anyone could've been at them.

Then again, we know we're dealing with someone highly educated and familiar with the Constitution. Maybe, just maybe, someone at the library will remember him.

First, however, she needed to figure out which library Emily had been talking about.

She started to leaf back through the entries, trying to find a hint. Emily Haven had been meticulous in her notes; it was clear she had a keen eye for detail. Yet, she also tended to jump between subjects quickly, an excitement and passion for life shifting her focus with an engaging unpredictability.

Finally, like a beacon of hope, a sentence jumped out at Dana. Emily had written about finding an old political philosophy book from her favorite library, the Barclay Public Library.

Using her phone, Dana looked up the library. She scrolled through the pictures, the events page, and finally landed on the staff page. All the staff, however, were either young women or old men, none of whom fit the profile.

Sighing and not knowing what else to do, Dana began skimming the library's old blog posts. Most of them were about author readings and other local events, but one jumped out at her. The title was 'Turning a New Leaf.' Among other things, the article explained that Barclay would be parting with one of its longstanding librarians, a man named John Miller. The article didn't state the reason for the dismissal, but it was enough to get Dana thinking.

"Why did they let him go?" she thought."And how do I find out?"

Dana looked at the picture attached to the article. John Miller was a middle-aged man, graying around the temples and sporting a pair of horn-rimmed glasses. His placid smile did nothing to suggest a dangerous man, but she knew better than most that appearances could be deceiving.

She continued to research John Miller, but the internet yielded no further information. A quick search on social media showed no trace of him, like he was non-existent on digital platforms. This was unusual in this era, but not completely unheard of.

Then, just when she was beginning to think this might be a dead end, she came across a post on the Barclay Public Library's social media page. The post was from someone named Shauna Gladis, and in the post she vented about a "Constitutional debate gone wrong" she'd had with "one of the librarians" in which, among other things, the librarian had "verbally abused" her and even beaten her elderly grandfather with a geography book until several people dragged him away.

Dana sat back, stunned. Could that person be John Miller? She cross-referenced the date on Gladis's post with the date on the Barclay site's article. The two had been written only a few days apart.

There was no question: Shauna Gladis must have been talking about John Miller.

And what are the chances he's the person Emily Haven was talking about in her journal, too?

 

*   *   *

 

Dana pulled up to the library where John Miller used to work, her heart still pounding from her recent discovery. She glanced at her phone, noticing that Sam hadn't responded to the text she'd left on her way out of the police station. Taking a deep breath, she hit the call button and waited for him to pick up.

"Hey, it's Sam. I can't take your call right now, but leave me a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can."

"Sam, it's Dana," she said, trying to keep her voice steady. "I think I found something important about our case. Call me back as soon as you can." With that, she hung up and stepped out of her vehicle.

The library stood before her like an ancient fortress, its stone walls weathered by time and lined with ivy. The building was an architectural relic, nestled between modern skyscrapers and busy city streets. As Dana approached, she admired the grand archway above the entrance, its intricate carvings showcasing the importance of knowledge and free thought throughout history.

Pushing open the heavy wooden doors, Dana entered the library and was met with the comforting scent of old books and polished wood. She paused for a moment, taking in the vast expanse of shelves that stretched toward the high ceiling. Sunlight streamed through the tall windows, casting a warm glow on the rows of tables and cozy reading nooks scattered throughout the room.

As Dana strolled deeper into the library, she felt a sense of reverence for this temple of learning. Amidst the hushed whispers and rustling pages, she could almost hear the echoes of past debates and intellectual pursuits that had taken place within these walls. She wondered whether John Miller had left any traces of his presence – and his temper – in this sacred space.

"Can I help you find something?" a gentle voice interrupted her thoughts. Dana turned to see a middle-aged librarian with short, wavy gray hair and a pair of wire-rimmed glasses perched on her nose. The woman's warm, brown eyes displayed genuine concern as she offered a small, polite smile.

"Actually, yes," Dana said. "I was hoping to learn more about a former employee of this library, John Miller."

The mention of Miller's name seemed to trigger a mix of surprise and unease in the librarian. She took a moment to collect her thoughts before responding cautiously, "John Miller...he worked here up until a few months ago. What do you need to know?"

"Could you tell me what he was like?" Dana asked, studying the woman's expression for any hints of insight.

The librarian sighed, the memories clearly painful to recall. "John was a very intelligent man, no doubt about that. But he was also quite...intense. He had a strong passion for constitutional laws, especially those pertaining to freedom of speech. Unfortunately, that passion often led to heated arguments with other employees and patrons."

"How so?" Dana asked.

"Well, there was one time when he got into a shouting match with a coworker over the interpretation of the First Amendment," the librarian said, her voice strained. "He was adamant that it should be applied in a very specific way, and couldn't tolerate any differing opinions. He became so angry that he threatened the other employee, saying he'd make sure they never worked in a library again."

"Obsession with perfection," Dana mused aloud. It fits the profile.

The librarian nodded solemnly. "Yes, that's one way to put it. His obsession ultimately cost him his job here. We couldn't risk the safety and well-being of our staff and patrons with someone so...so volatile on the premises."

Outside, the sun cast its warm glow upon the streets of Philadelphia, dappling the library's walls with golden light. It looked quiet and peaceful out there. Inside, however, Dana felt anything but calm.

Dana glanced at her phone, hoping for a message from Sam, but the screen remained stubbornly silent. Frustration bubbled within her, mingled with concern for her partner. However, she couldn't wait any longer; she had to confront Miller on her own.

"Anything else I can help you with?" the librarian asked.

"No," Dana said thoughtfully. "No, you've given me plenty. Thank you."

"Good luck," the librarian called out as Dana strode toward the exit, her heels clicking against the polished floor like a ticking clock.

As Dana stepped out into the bustling street, she wrapped her scarf tighter around her neck, steeling herself against the chill in the air—and the daunting task ahead. 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR
 

 

Dana checked her phone for what seemed the hundredth time, hoping to see a call or message from Sam.

No dice.

She sighed. "Guess I'm on my own for this one."

She slipped the phone into her pocket and returned her attention to the building in front of her—a pawnshop. The building was old, with faded brick walls and a rusted metal sign hanging above the entrance. It looked more like a relic of a former civilization than an operating business. Dana furrowed her brow, puzzled. This was the address the librarian had given her for John Miller, but as far as she could tell, this was a business, not a home.

Casting a glance up and down the street, Dana decided that even if Miller wasn't here, someone inside might be able to tell her where she could find him. She got out of her car and crossed the busy street, navigating through the bustling city life. Pedestrians rushed past her, their faces buried in phones or lost in thought, completely oblivious to the fact that a serial killer could be living right under their noses.

As she reached the pawnshop, Dana noticed a neon OPEN sign flickering in the window. She pushed open the door, which creaked loudly in protest, and stepped inside.

A bell tinkled overhead, the sound cutting through the musty air. The dim lighting cast long shadows across the dusty shelves and cluttered display cases. It seemed like a place lost in time, untouched by the busy streets outside.

Dana didn't see any other people in the shop, but she could feel the weight of countless stories behind each item on display. As she studied the eclectic nature of the merchandise – an array of tarnished brass instruments, chipped porcelain dolls, and worn-out books lining the walls – she began to suspect that owner's choice of which items to stock had a good deal to do with why this place wasn't drawing in more customers.

As she wandered deeper into the store, her gaze was drawn to a collection of controversial historical items. A tarnished silver pocket watch engraved with a Confederate flag caught her eye, and next to it, a tome written about the assassination of JFK with the dubious title, The Last, Final Protest Against Tyranny.

Whoever owns this place must have a very strange sense of patriotism, Dana thought to herself with a shudder.

In one corner, she noticed a glass case containing a set of antique dueling pistols alongside a tattered copy of the Constitution. A handwritten note beside the pistols claimed they had once belonged to a prominent Southern gentleman who had used them to defend his honor during the Civil War.

"Such a bizarre combination of items," Dana mused, trying to suppress her uneasiness. As her fingertips traced the edge of the glass case, she wondered if the person responsible for collecting these pieces felt some sort of affinity for those who defied conventions or fought for their ideals, no matter how twisted those ideals might be.

Maybe John Miller sees himself as a rebel, too.

A faint sound from the depths of the shop caught Dana's attention, breaking her contemplation of the peculiar collection. "Hello?" she called out. "Is anyone there?"

As if in response, a sleek black cat emerged from the shadows, its green eyes fixed on her. The feline sauntered over, its long tail swishing gracefully. Dana crouched down and scratched behind the cat's ears, feeling a sense of comfort in its presence amidst the unsettling atmosphere.

"Where's your owner, huh?" she asked softly, noticing how the cat seemed to crave affection. It purred as it rubbed against her hand before turning its attention to a nearby unmarked door. The cat meowed and scratched insistently at the door, clearly wanting Dana to open it.

"Alright," Dana murmured, growing curious. "Let's see what's behind door number one." With a deep breath, she turned the handle and opened the door.

The moment she did so, the cat darted through the doorway and disappeared down a flight of dark steps. Dana hesitated, her heart pounding as she peered into the gloom. The musty scent of damp earth and decaying wood wafted up from below, hinting at a basement filled with secrets waiting to be discovered.

"Damn it," she muttered, torn between her desire for answers and her uneasiness about descending into the unknown. Ultimately, her investigative instincts won out.

Dana carefully took one step at a time, the creaking wooden steps seeming to protest her intrusion. She reached for a light switch on the wall and flicked it, but nothing happened. A shiver ran down her spine, and she pulled out her cell phone, using its flashlight feature to cut through the oppressive darkness.

As she reached the bottom of the stairs, the musty odor intensified. The dirt floor beneath her feet was uneven, littered with dust and debris that crunched under her boots. Dana swept the beam of light from her phone around the basement, revealing an eerie scene before her.

Items covered with plastic sheets filled the space, transforming them into ghostly shapes that loomed in the darkness. Among them was a monkey wearing a red cap, its wide grin frozen beneath a sheet of transparent plastic that clung to its grotesque features. The nape of Dana's neck prickled as she examined the other objects: a life-sized mannequin dressed in tattered clothing, a collection of old dolls with cracked porcelain faces and unblinking eyes, stacks of yellowed newspapers that seemed to chronicle decades of tragedy.

Creepy doesn't even begin to describe this place, she thought, feeling her unease grow. This must be where the owner keeps items not on display. I'm not sure which items are less appealing, the ones upstairs or the ones down here.

While she was still studying this strange assortment of items, she heard a groaning sound overhead. The sound was faint, yet distinct enough to catch Dana's attention. It resembled the creaking of an old door or the settling of a wooden floor in an ancient building. Her flashlight revealed the source: rusty pipes overhead that snaked through the basement like twisted metal veins. She realized that the plumbing must be connected to the adjoining buildings, as was often the case in these old Philadelphia structures.

As she studied the dusty pipes, a cluster of spiders caught her eye. They were large, their abdomens swollen and covered with fine hairs that shimmered in the dim light. Long, spindly legs extended from their bodies, clinging to the pipes and walls. Despite her training and experience, Dana couldn't help but shudder at the sight of them. She had no problem with spiders in a well-lit environment, but when they were hanging over her hard in a dim, shadowy room—well, that was something else entirely.

Just then, the cat meowed again, drawing her attention to a corner of the basement. Two bowls rested there, one empty and the other half-filled with murky water. A bag of cat food lay nearby, its contents strewn about. Dana knelt down and opened the bag, only to find that the food inside was moldy and inedible.

"Whoever works here doesn't give a damn about you, do they?" Dana murmured to the cat, a pang of sympathy rising within her. She knew that the state of the cat's living conditions could be a reflection of the person responsible for them. If John Miller truly was the serial killer she'd been chasing, it wouldn’t be surprising to see him neglect the welfare of a helpless animal.

Dana picked up the cat and cradled it in her arms, stroking its fur gently. The feline purred softly, a low rumble that vibrated against Dana's chest.

"Speaking of your owner," Dana said, "where is he, huh?" She didn't know for sure that John Miller was the owner of the pawnshop, but she was becoming more and more convinced that such was the case.

To her surprise, a muffled voice reached her ears from somewhere nearby, as if responding to her question. She tensed, her heart pounding as she scanned the basement for the source of the sound. The voice came again, faint and indistinct.

Dana set the cat down, whispered, "Stay here," and crept cautiously toward the noise.

She noticed a tarp hanging on the wall, billowing ever so slightly. Grasping the edge of the tarp, she pulled it back, revealing a hidden doorway. Dana stepped through the doorway, letting the tarp fall limp behind her, and began feeling along the wall for a light switch.

When Dana at last found the light switch and flicked it on, she was pleasantly surprised to discover that it worked.

The room revealed by the overhead fluorescents was starkly different from the cluttered, musty basement she had just left. It was cleaner, more organized, with a refrigerator humming quietly in one corner, a table with a few chairs, and a functional cot pressed against the far wall. A sense of unease settled in Dana's gut—it was clear someone had been living here.

Dana's eyes continued to scan the room, her heart pounding in her ears as she took in every detail. The photographs tacked haphazardly to the walls caught her attention—they were chillingly familiar. As she moved closer, realization struck her like a bolt of lightning: these were the killer's victims.

Julia Bennett, Emily Haven, Petra Delgado, and Kim Nguyen, all of them caught on film at public speaking events—perhaps the very events where they'd been murdered. There were pictures of other young women, too. Were they victims whose bodies hadn't been found yet? No, that seemed unlikely, since the killer hadn't made any efforts to hide the bodies. More likely, they were the killer's next victims.

Dana's breath hitched in her throat, her pulse quickening with every picture she studied.

On a nearby table, Dana spotted a stack of handwritten notes on constitutional law, their margins filled with feverish scribblings. A cold shiver ran down her spine as she noticed political pins stuck to the wall, pins taken from the victims' public rallies. Farther along the wall, a number of news clippings, which must have come hot off the press, considering the recency of the murders.

With growing urgency, Dana hurried over to the refrigerator and pulled the door open. A wave of nausea rolled over her.

Just as she'd suspected, the refrigerator contained an array of syringes and vials filled with clear liquid—the very poison, she felt certain, that had been used to murder the victims.

Now there could be no doubt: John Miller was the Constitution Killer.

But where was he?

Just then, while Dana was still studying the syringes and vials of liquid in the refrigerator, she heard a muffled voice again—this time much closer than before. 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE
 

 

Looking around, Dana noticed a small door in the wall, almost like a closet. With her gun drawn, she cautiously approached the door, her senses heightened.

"Who's there?" she called.

In response, she heard a muffled voice that sounded like it was pleading with her. Dana thought the voice was female, and her heart clenched with a mixture of dread and determination. Suspecting that John Miller had kidnapped his next victim, she tried to open the door. The door was secured, though, with a thick padlock, its rusty metal surface contrasting with the otherwise clean surroundings.

"Damn it," Dana muttered under her breath, frustrated by the obstacle standing between her and possibly rescuing the killer's next intended victim. She knew she needed to act quickly, but breaking the padlock without causing harm to the person inside wouldn't be easy. In the movies, people often shot padlocks to open them. Dana knew, however, there was a good chance that doing so would result in a ricochet, and in such a confined space, a ricochet could be deadly.

"Are you okay in there?" Dana asked. "I'm here to help."

"Please... hurry," came the weak reply from behind the door. The desperation in the woman's voice fueled Dana's urgency, and she racked her brain for a solution.

"Stay calm," Dana said. "I'm going to get you out of there." She racked her brain for a safer way to open the padlock without resorting to gunfire.

Her eyes darted around the room, searching for something that could help her. On a nearby table, she spotted a set of lock picking tools, probably the very ones Miller had used to break into the Liberty Bell Tribune. She grabbed them and knelt down in front of the door, carefully inserting the tension wrench and pick into the keyhole.

"Keep talking to me," Dana told the woman as she worked on the lock. "What's your name?"

"Maria," came the muffled response, her voice trembling with fear. "Please hurry."

"Doing my best, Maria," Dana said, feeling the sweat starting to bead on her forehead as she concentrated on the task at hand. After several tense moments, she felt the pins align, and the lock clicked open.

"Got it," Dana whispered, relief washing over her as she removed the padlock and swung the door open.

Inside the small, dimly-lit space, a woman huddled in the corner, her eyes wide with terror. She was bound at the wrists and ankles, her clothes disheveled and dirty. Her long, dark hair was tangled, sticking to her tear-streaked face, and there was blood on the side of her head.

Maria's eyes filled with hope and gratitude as she looked up at Dana. "I thought I was going to die."

"That's not going to happen," Dana said, her voice calm and steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins. "Because I'm going to get you out of here. Are you okay? Are you injured?"

"He hit me in the head with a brick…" Maria swallowed hard, remembering. "It's kind of numb, but I think I'm okay."

"Probably has a concussion at the very least," Dana thought. She examined Maria's restraints—thick rope bound the young woman's wrists tightly together behind her back, while her ankles were similarly secured. Grabbing a pocket knife from her belt, Dana carefully began cutting the ropes, making sure not to nick the woman's skin.

"Stay quiet, okay?" Dana whispered as she worked. "We're not safe yet, but I promise I'll get you out of here."

Maria nodded, her eyes never leaving Dana's face as the agent cut through the last of her bindings.

Just as Dana was about to free Maria's legs, she heard an unmistakable creak from upstairs. Her heart skipped a beat, realizing it wasn't a pipe—it was a floorboard. She glanced behind her, wondering if the cat might have gone back upstairs, but the cat was still in the next room, watching curiously.

Someone else must be upstairs. But who? Maybe a customer who had wandered in?

"Or Miller," she thought darkly, preparing for the worst. "Coming back to take care of unfinished business."

Whatever the case, Dana and Maria couldn't stay down here any longer. With frenzied haste, Dana worked to finish freeing the woman. Her hands were shaking as she sliced through the last of the restraints, the heavy rope feeling like it was mocking her desperate efforts.

"Please hurry!" Maria whimpered, tears streaming down her face.

"Shh," Dana said, her ears straining to pick up any sounds from above. "We'll be out of here in no time."

Another creak sounded – this time it sounded like it had come from the staircase – and Dana's heart leaped into her throat. She finished pulling away Maria's restraints, and then grabbed Maria's arm and led her out of the closet and into the room outside.

"Stay close," Dana whispered, her gun aimed at the tarp hiding the doorway she had used earlier to enter the room. Behind her, Maria crouched behind the refrigerator, her body trembling with terror. The air in the basement felt colder than it had before, oppressive even.

Dana's mind raced, sorting through a lifetime of training and experience as she tried to anticipate the killer's next move. Would he burst through the tarp, his eyes wild and filled with rage? Or was he crouching on the other side, biding his time until they made a false step?

"Come on, Miller," Dana thought, her hands clammy as they gripped her weapon. "Show yourself." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWENTY SIX
 

 

Dana shifted her grip on the gun, the seconds slipping by like hours. Where was Miller? If he was indeed waiting for her, how long would he wait? Or was it possible he didn't know anything was amiss?

"Not likely," she thought. "If he's on the other side of that tarp, he must see that the light's on in here. Someone as meticulous as Miller would remember whether or not he left the light on."

Whatever the case, she didn't have to do this alone. Careful not to take her eyes off the hidden doorway, she pulled out her phone and called Sam. Nothing happened. Glancing at the screen, she saw that she had no signal—not a great surprise, considering all the steel and copper running over her head.

"Damn it," she murmured, putting the phone away. She and Maria were trapped in this musty basement, disconnected from the outside world—and somewhere nearby, perhaps waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike, was a merciless murderer.

"No backup?" Maria asked.

Dana glanced at the woman, who was still crouched behind the refrigerator. Her face was pale, her dark eyes wide with fear. She looked to be in her early thirties, her long brown hair disheveled after her ordeal. Despite her terror, however, she appeared determined not to break down.

Dana shook her head. She didn't want the killer to hear her, in case he was listening.

"How did you find me?" Maria asked in a low voice, her gaze flickering between Dana and the tarp.

"Actually, I didn't know you were here," Dana admitted, her brow furrowing with frustration. "I was tracking John Miller. I just happened to stumble upon you."

Maria was silent. Dana asked, "How did you end up here?"

Maria wiped away a tear as she began to recount her horrifying ordeal. "I was heading home, opening my front door after having coffee with some friends at a cafe, when I turned around and saw him approaching me with a needle. I kicked him…and then he tackled me to the ground and hit me with the brick."

Dana's heart ached as she listened to Maria's words, knowing how close the woman had come to becoming another one of Miller's victims. "You're a survivor," she said. "You're going to make it through this."

A car horn honked on the street outside, jolting Dana back to the reality of how close they were to the world outside, yet how far away help seemed. She continued to listen intently as Maria explained what happened after she was abducted.

"Maria," she said, testing a theory, "did you have a public speaking event recently, by any chance?"

Maria looked surprised by the question. "I was supposed to have one just yesterday, but I was told I would have to postpone for a few weeks—something about a public emergency. Why?"

Dana felt a surge of relief for having insisted they take measures to prevent any other political rallies in the city. Miller must have intended to kill Maria at that event, but her last-minute cancellation had forced him to improvise. This man was not only sick, but he was also dangerously adaptable. They needed to get out of there now.

"There's no time to explain now," Dana said. "We need to get out of here before Miller comes back. Stay close to me and keep quiet."

At first, it seemed like Maria might stay in her hiding place, unwilling to emerge. Then, slowly, she stepped out into the room and stood behind Dana, lingering there like a shadow.

With her senses on high alert, Dana led Maria toward the tarp. Every creak and rustle made her tense, anticipating Miller's sudden appearance. In one swift motion, she swept back the tarp, half expecting to see Miller standing there.

There was no one, however. Just an empty room.

Relief flooded through Dana, but she knew they were far from safe. As they traversed the dimly lit basement, Dana couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. She glanced around, taking in the cracked porcelain dolls, tarnished silverware, and other forgotten items covered in plastic that surrounded them. The weight of her gun felt reassuring in her hand, a reminder of her training and her fierce determination to protect Maria and bring Miller to justice.

The path through the cluttered basement was a minefield of forgotten relics. Dana's eyes darted from one object to another, cataloging them as she led Maria past a dusty carousel horse, its once-vibrant paint faded and chipped; an old brass saxophone, tarnished with age; a collection of rusted tools, their original purposes long lost to time. Each item seemed to hold a secret story, a silent witness to countless moments of hope and heartbreak.

"Almost there," Dana murmured. Her hand tightened around the grip of her gun as they drew closer to the staircase—their only way out. The air in the basement felt heavy and oppressive, as if the very walls were closing in on them. Dana knew that any false step or careless noise could betray their position to Miller, and so she moved with the quiet precision of a predator stalking its prey.

Maria, trembling but determined, stayed close behind Dana, her breath shallow and rapid. As they neared the foot of the stairs, Dana paused, her gaze drawn to a familiar tableau: cracked porcelain dolls with vacant eyes, a monkey wearing a red cap, a stack of yellowed newspapers bound together by fraying twine. The mannequin in tattered clothing was still there, too, but it looked different somehow, not quite as she remembered it.

Dana was still puzzling over this discrepancy when something brushed against her legs, making her jump. She looked down to see the cat weaving between her ankles. It moved with a sinuous grace, its fur sleek and black. The cat's presence was both comforting and disconcerting.

Then the cat moved away from Dana, walking toward the mannequin. The cat brushed against the mannequin's legs, back and forth, back and forth. Through the mannequin's tattered clothing, Dana could see patches of skin, and they weren't the ghostly white she had seen earlier.

No, this mannequin's skin was much more human. Too human.

Just as realization dawned on Dana, the mannequin began to move. It lunged at her, the plastic cover hissing over the figure's head as it pushed forward. Dana tried to raise her gun, but before she could do so, the figure – a man whose eyes burned with a fiery intensity, as she could now clearly see – collided with her, knocking her back.

Dana stumbled on something – the cat, more than likely – and fell, striking her head hard against the base of the stairs.

And then the world went black. 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN
 

 

Dana's eyelids fluttered open, her vision hazy and unfocused. As consciousness returned, she registered the chill of the concrete floor beneath her. Her ears were filled with the frantic tempo of her heart.

"Where am I?" she wondered, dazed. "What happened?"

Her gaze darted around the dim room, taking in the rough concrete walls and the steel and copper pipes snaking across the ceiling. Then she spotted a man bent over a woman prone on the floor. The man was binding the woman's limbs together.

In a flash, it all came back to Dana and she tried to sit up. She quickly discovered, however, that she was bound as well: her wrists connected by her own handcuffs, her ankles tied with a coil of rough rope. She lay back, panting and trying to compose her thoughts.

"Be quiet," she told herself. "He doesn't know you're awake, and the longer you can keep it that way, the better."

As Dana tried to think of a way to free herself from her restraints, she recalled a trick she had learned during her time at the FBI academy for opening handcuffs using a bobby pin. Despite the throbbing pain in her head, Dana focused on the memory, determined to escape before Miller had finished tying up Maria. She reached up and felt in her hair for a moment before extracting a bobby pin.

"Glad I didn't just wear my hair loose today".

Her heart pounded in her chest as she attempted to manipulate the tiny metal tool into the locking mechanism of the handcuffs. Her fingers trembled. After several tense seconds, she felt the pin catch on something within the lock. Holding her breath, she applied pressure, praying that it would work. With an almost imperceptible click, the handcuff released its grip on her wrist, and she exhaled in relief.

After quietly setting the handcuffs aside, Dana wasted no time in attacking the ropes that bound her legs. Her fingers worked quickly, despite the lingering numbness from her captivity. Just as she was making progress on the knots, however, she heard Miller grunt with satisfaction as he finished securing Maria's bindings. Panic surged through Dana, and she made a snap decision to pretend she was still tied up and unconscious.

She hastily placed the now-open handcuffs back around her wrists, ensuring they weren't actually clipped together. Closing her eyes, she willed her body to go limp and her breathing to slow, hoping to convince Miller that she was still out cold.

It was agonizing, lying there with her eyes closed as she listened to Miller's approaching footsteps. He was mumbling, though Dana couldn't tell what he was saying. As he drew nearer, she dared to peek through her barely opened eyes, straining to get a glimpse of him.

Miller was a tall, imposing figure, with disheveled hair and a wild look in his eyes that betrayed his unhinged mind. His face, illuminated by the pale glow of the screen of the phone he held, looked gaunt and haggard.

It suddenly occurred to Dana that after staring at the bright screen for so long, it would be difficult for him to see anything in the dark room, giving her a potential advantage. Seizing the opportunity, Dana cautiously began to take off the handcuffs, her fingers trembling slightly from nerves and adrenaline. All the while, she kept a watchful eye on Miller, who appeared to be utterly transfixed by whatever he was looking at on his phone.

"Perfect location," Miller murmured, still absorbed in his device. Dana shivered as she realized he was deciding where to leave her and Maria's bodies after he killed them. This knowledge fueled her determination to escape and save them both.

Focusing back on her task, Dana carefully removed the ropes tied around her legs, her movements slow and deliberate to avoid catching Miller's attention. Her muscles tensed with every tug, her mind imagining what could happen if she failed.

With her restraints now off, Dana turned her attention to solving the problem of how to surprise and subdue Miller. She felt a surge of anger as she noticed her own gun shoved haphazardly into his belt, adding insult to injury. She knew that she would have to get close to him and disarm him before he had a chance to draw the weapon.

Just then, a rustling sound caught her attention. It sounded like the cat was scratching at its bag of cat food nearby. Miller turned his head toward the noise, momentarily distracted. Dana seized the opportunity, her instincts kicking in as she leaped from her position and charged toward Miller with all the pent-up fury and determination she could muster.

Her body collided with his, their forms crashing together with a resounding thud that filled the room. The impact was greater than she had anticipated, but she didn't have time to dwell on the pain that shot through her shoulder as she Miller slammed into the grinning monkey. Instead, she watched as the cell phone flew from Miller's grasp, clattering across the floor. The gun followed suit, sliding across the cold concrete and disappearing into the darkness.

Dana expected a wrestling match, but to her surprise, Miller immediately rolled away from her and vanished into the shadows, leaving her in a sea of darkness. Dana's heart pounded in her chest as she strained to see, her ears alert for any sound that might give away his position.

After a few seconds, she turned her attention to her fallen weapon. Sinking to her haunches, she inched across the floor, her hands blindly searching while her head remained raised, alert for the slightest movement—not that she would be able to see much in the near-total darkness of the basement.

At last her fingers brushed cold steel, and she drew the weapon to herself, clutching it grateful. Armed again, Dana rose and hurried back toward Maria, her eyes darting back and forth between the terrified woman – who was still lying where Dana had last seen her, as if paralyzed by fear – and the inky blackness where Miller had disappeared.

"It's okay," Dana assured Maria. "I'm going to get you out—"

Just then, however, Dana spotted Miller emerging from the shadows behind Maria. With cat-like swiftness, Miller pulled Maria up into a sitting position, wrapping one arm around her neck and placing the other against her head. It was a martial arts move Dana knew well.

An execution move.

"Drop the gun," Miller said, "or I'll snap her neck." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT
 

 

"Let's just take a breath," Dana said, her finger hovering over the trigger as she aimed at Miller. Could she hit him? She was an excellent shooter, and she could see the pale glow of the man's face hovering over Maria's shoulder like an evil moon. If this were practice, she would've bet good money on making the shot.

Unfortunately, however, this wasn't practice. Practice involved shooting at dummies, but here, there was a very high probability that Dana would hit a human target – Maria – even if she missed Miller, and one bullet could very well be fatal.

"Don't play games with me," Miller growled, his arm tightening around Maria's throat. "I'll give you three seconds, and if you don't drop the gun by then, she dies."

"We can work this out," Dana said, still hoping she might get a good shot. "Let's just calm down, and—"

Miller's face contorted with rage, his eyes blazing and nostrils flaring like a wild animal backed into a corner. The muscles in his jaw tightened, and Dana could see the veins standing out on his neck as he clenched his teeth. His anger was raw, primal, and terrifying.

"Put the gun down!" Miller roared. "Now! Or she dies!"

Dana swallowed hard, her heart hammering in her chest. She had no doubt that Miller was serious—he was more than willing to murder Maria right here and now. It might not have been his plan to kill Maria in this basement, but that didn't mean he couldn't improvise afterward, transporting her body somewhere else and staging her death.

"Okay!" Dana said, bending as she lowered the gun to the floor, her eyes still locked on Miller's. "Just don't hurt her."

"Good," Miller hissed, visibly relieved. His eyes flicked to the gun for a moment before returning to Dana. "Now we're going to take a little ride, you and Maria here." A sinister grin spread across his face, making him look even more menacing. "I have big plans for both of you."

As Dana fought to control her fear, she noticed that her phone was no longer where it had fallen earlier. Confused, she scanned the basement, trying to figure out where it could be. Her gaze landed on Maria, whose eyes were wide with terror—but no, that wasn't quite right. There was something else in the woman's eyes, too, something more...controlled.

"She did something," Dana thought. "She did something, and she's hoping it will help."

As they locked eyes, Dana suddenly understood—Maria must have found the phone. Glancing down, Dana noticed a faint glow emanating from Maria's pocket. Relief washed over her as she realized that the phone was still on, its light a beacon of hope in the darkness.

Dana didn't know if Maria's call for help had gone through, given the terrible signal in the basement, but it gave her hope that maybe, just maybe, help was on the way. The best thing she could do, then, was to stall Miller as much as possible, keep him distracted so he wouldn't realize what was going on.

"John Miller," Dana said, her voice steady despite the fear that threatened to overwhelm her.

Miller looked startled for a moment, then relaxed. "That's my name, don't wear it out."

"Why did you leave quotes from the First Amendment at your crime scenes?" She hoped that by engaging him in a discussion about constitutional law, she could exploit his ego and obsession long enough for help to arrive.

Miller sneered, his eyes narrowing as he regarded her with disdain. "You wouldn't understand," he replied dismissively, his greasy hair sticking to his forehead. His face was gaunt and pale, as if he hadn't taken care of himself in several days, yet there was an unsettling intelligence behind his eyes that suggested he was capable of far more than appearances suggested.

"Try me," Dana said, meeting his gaze head-on.

Miller hesitated for a moment before his lips curled into a grim smile. "Alright then," he said, seemingly unable to resist the urge to debate. "I left those quotes to make a point about the importance of the Constitution, about how this country treats it like a joke."

"What are you talking about?"

"The world's gone mad, can't you see? Everything's falling apart right under our noses! Nobody respects the roots of this nation, the core beliefs it was built on. We've got to shout it from the rooftops, make 'em get it! If we wanna fix this mess, we've gotta shove those principles right in their faces, or we'll spiral into chaos!"

"Are you trying to tell me," Dana said, "that you're doing this to support the Constitution somehow?"

"That's exactly right," Miller said, shifting his feet in agitation. "I'm trying to fix the damage that has been done by so-called 'modern' thinkers. Nobody has a damn clue what freedom is—certainly not you and your nosy, oversized agency."

"You're trying to teach me a lesson?" Dana asked, trying to hide the shock in her voice.

"There's a war going on in our country," Miller said, his eyes lighting up, "a war between those who understand the Constitution and those who don't. I'm just helping the people who do to find the traitors who don't."

"So you're saying that the people you've killed weren't innocent?" Dana asked, trying to keep the conversation going. "They were...traitors?"

Miller shook his head, as if disgusted with her. "You're clueless, blind to the truth! Those women pretended to know the Constitution, but they watered it down, turned it into something that couldn't keep this country standing, let alone thriving. That's why they had to go. They were fakes, spreading lies and stupidity!"

"You talk about the importance of the Constitution," Dana said, "and yet you break the law by murdering. How do you reconcile those two?"

He smiled grimly. "The Constitution doesn't say anything about murder."

It occurred to Dana that he was right—the only crime defined in the Constitution was treason. She was still thinking of how to reply when she heard a muffled sound from upstairs—a distant knock, perhaps. Her pulse quickened. Was it possible that help had arrived? She knew she needed to keep Miller distracted for as long as possible.

"Keep him talking," Dana thought. "Keep him distracted." She racked her brain for another question about the murders as she looked into Miller's eyes, which were filled with a dangerous mix of anger and self-righteousness.

"Tell me," she said, trying to sound casual despite her racing heart. "If you think these victims didn't truly understand the Constitution, what makes you so sure that you do?"

"Because I serve a higher power who really gets the Constitution," Miller said with unassailable confidence. "He's the one who picked me, the one who prepared me, the one who told me who to kill. He makes the rules—I'm just his soldier, his weapon."

"God, you mean?" Dana asked. "You didn't strike me as the religious type."

Miller opened his mouth as if ready to answer, but then he closed it again. His eyes narrowed shrewdly, as if he had just figured out a trick that had been played on him.

"Stalling me, huh?" he said with a dark chuckle. "Well, you've had your fun. Now put on the cuffs."

Before Dana could do so, however, she heard the distinct creak of the door at the top of the stairs opening. Miller immediately gestured for her to back away toward the wall. She complied, her heart pounding furiously in her chest. Miller, still holding Maria as a hostage, moved forward with purpose. Dana's hands clenched into fists at her sides, every instinct screaming at her to do something, anything, to prevent what was unfolding before her eyes.

But what?

While Dana was still agonizing over what to do, Miller stooped down and picked up the gun Dana had dropped earlier.

"Damn it!" Dana thought. "Why didn't I kick it aside?"

Miller held Maria close, his arm wrapped around her neck as he made his way to the bottom of the stairs, the gun pointed upward.

"Show yourself!" he bellowed up the stairs, his voice reverberating off the damp basement walls. Dana watched him, tense and alert. She knew that he was losing control, becoming more desperate and unpredictable by the second—which would only make him more dangerous.

A moment later, Miller fired several shots up the stairs, the deafening sound reverberating through the basement. Maria screamed, her face contorted with terror.

From upstairs, Dana heard Sam's voice call out, anger and frustration evident in his tone. "Well, that wasn't fair. Using a human shield?"

"Fair?" Miller asked, a malicious grin spreading across his face. "The fair thing would be for me to leave with Maria here, and in return, I won't kill Agent Blaze. How does that sound?"

Sam fell silent for a moment, as if weighing his options. Then he called down to Dana, a hint of concern in his voice. "Are you alright, Dana?"

Dana swallowed hard, struggling to keep her emotions in check as she answered, "Yes, Sam, I'm okay."

"Everything's going to be alright," Sam said. Then Dana heard him address Miller again. "I want to talk to you face to face. Lower your weapon and let's resolve this."

Miller hesitated for a split second, his eyes flicking back and forth between Sam's location above and Dana standing against the wall. Finally, he growled, "Fine, I'll lower my weapon."

Dana's breath caught in her throat as she watched Miller lower his gun, but only slightly. It seemed abundantly clear to her that if Sam appeared at the top of the stairs, Miller wouldn't hesitate to shoot him. She couldn't let that happen—not to Sam.

"Alright," Sam called down. "I'm going to step into the doorway."

"Go ahead," Miller replied, a sinister edge to his voice that made Dana's skin crawl. "I won't fire." But she knew he was lying. She could see it in the way his finger twitched on the trigger, his grip tense and ready.

Dana had to act. Not knowing what else to do, she sprinted toward Miller, shouting up a warning to her partner at the same time: "Sam, look out!"

Miller spun around, his gun aimed squarely at Dana. His eyes narrowed with fury, his finger tightening on the trigger. But before he could squeeze off a shot, two deafening explosions rang out, filling the room with the smell of gunpowder and the sound of Maria's terrified screams.

Miller's body jerked violently with the impact of the bullets, one after the other. He crumpled to the floor like a ragdoll, releasing his grip on Maria as he went down. Instinctively, Dana reached out and caught hold of the trembling woman, pulling her close as she sobbed uncontrollably.

"It's okay," Dana whispered into her ear, even as her own heart threatened to burst from her chest. "You're safe now."

Dana turned just in time to see Sam rushing toward her down the stairs, his gun drawn and his face flushed with adrenaline. His dark hair was damp with perspiration, and the beginnings of a beard shadowed his angular jawline. It had been a long day for both of them, but Sam looked as determined as ever.

"Sam," Dana said, relief washing over her.

Ignoring the gratitude in her voice, Sam focused on the immediate threat. He kicked away the gun that had fallen from Miller's hand, sending it skittering across the floor. Then, he bent down to check Miller for a pulse, his fingers pressing against the side of the man's neck. Dana watched him intently, anxiety churning in her gut as she waited for an answer.

"Is he...?" she asked, unable to finish the question.

Sam shook his head without looking up. "He's dead," he said, his voice low and somber.

Dana nodded, feeling numb and unable to process the shock of what had just happened. Sam straightened and looked her in the eyes, his face grave, his lips set tight together. He took Dana's face in his hands.

"You were right, Dana," he said. "You were right." 

 

 

 

CHAPTER TWENTY NINE
 

 

Dana filled the metal bowl from a bag of fresh cat food and watched as the emaciated cat settled down and began to eat voraciously. She stroked its bony back, grateful to be able to feed the animal that had been treated so poorly by John Miller.

"Wouldn't peg Miller as the type to have a roommate," Sam remarked, a hint of a smile curving his lips.

"Certainly didn't have any interest in the animal," Dana said. "Probably got stuck with her when his brother passed and left him the store."

Dana stood up, her eyes scanning the room Miller had used to plan his murders. The forensic team was hard at work, collecting evidence from every corner of the dark room. One woman had the refrigerator door open and was pulling out the vials and syringes out at a time, passing the items to a man who slipped them into evidence bags and labeled them. A third technician took pictures and scribbled notes.

Dana felt relief surge through her, knowing that Miller would never harm another person again. But there was something else nagging at her mind—a feeling of unease, as if perhaps something remained unresolved. She frowned, trying to pinpoint the source of her disquiet.

"He's dead, Dana," she told herself. "And he's not coming back. Besides, you saved Maria. So what's wrong?"

Sam seemed to sense her unease, too. He gently touched her arm. "Are you feeling okay? You seem a bit spacey."

Dana hesitated, rubbing the back of her head where a dull ache persisted. "I hit my head pretty hard earlier and blacked out for a moment, but I'll be fine." She forced a smile, not wanting to worry Sam any further.

His concern deepened as he took in her slightly pale complexion. "Damn it, Dana, why didn't you say so sooner? We need to get you checked out."

Dana shook her head. "I'm fine, really. I'll see one of the medics later. I just want to be here for this."

Sam sighed, as if to say there was nothing he could do about her stubbornness, and then crossed his arms.

"Thanks for saving my life, by the way," Dana said. "If you hadn't shown up when you did..."

Sam shook his head, clearly relieved. "I'm just glad Maria's call went through. I should've taken your calls earlier, though—I'm sorry about that." His voice was tinged with guilt, but Dana waved it away.

"You had no idea what I was up against," she said.

Sam grunted. "That's the problem."

Just then, Dana noticed one of the scientists searching through a stack of papers. Among them was a notebook covered in scribbles, its pages worn and dog-eared. Curious, she approached the scientist.

"Excuse me," Dana said, nodding toward the notebook. "What is that?"

The scientist glanced at her, then at the notebook. "It appears to be some kind of journal. Found it among Miller's things."

"Can I see it?" Dana asked.

"Sure," the scientist replied, handing her a pair of latex gloves.

Once properly gloved, Dana took the journal and examined it. The cover was tattered, and the pages were yellowed with age. It had an air of chaos, much like the man who had penned it.

Dana's eyes scanned the pages, her brow furrowed in concentration. The handwriting was a tangled mess of loops and jagged lines, as if the author had been in the throes of a manic episode. It was difficult to decipher, but she found herself drawn into the chaotic scrawl.

"Can you make any sense of it?" Sam asked, leaning in to get a better look at the journal. His brown hair fell into his eyes, and he absently brushed it away with the back of his hand.

"Mostly rants on the Constitution," Dana said. "But they're disjointed and nonsensical. I can't find anything about the murders or how Miller planned them."

"Maybe it's just the ramblings of a madman," Sam said with a shrug. "No need to go down that rabbit hole."

Dana bit her lip, unconvinced. It wasn't her MO to just give up asking questions as soon as she'd stopped a criminal. She wanted to know why Miller had done what he did—not least of all because she wanted to confirm for certain that Miller hadn't abducted any other women she didn't know about.

Just then, Dana heard her name being called and glanced up to see Agent Michaels striding toward them, a rare smile on his face. She straightened her posture unconsciously, bracing for his usual barrage of criticisms. There was no such need, however.

"Blaze, Harris, congratulations on a job well done," Michaels said, clapping a heavy hand on Sam's shoulder. The praise felt alien coming from him.

"Thank you, sir," Sam said.

"To be fair, we didn't really 'catch' him," Dana found herself saying. "The man is dead, after all."

Michaels shrugged, his smile undiminished. "Better this way, anyway. Cleaner. At least the American public won't be paying for him to watch TV in prison, right?"

Dana clenched her jaw, the words leaving a bitter taste in her mouth. She understood the practicality behind Michaels' sentiment, but it still felt wrong to her.

Michaels turned to Sam. "I want you to know that I spoke with the mayor, and I personally mentioned both your names."

"Thank you very much, sir," Sam said in a voice that sounded half-pleased, half-uninterested. Dana got the impression that Sam was just playing along, helping Michaels feel magnanimous.

"He wanted to reach out and thank you both," Michaels went on. "In fact, I arranged for you to meet him..."

Dana rubbed her temples, struggling to focus on the conversation as her head throbbed in pain. She wished she could just leave and let Sam handle the rest. All she wanted was to return to the hotel and get some sleep. The exhaustion weighed heavily on her body, and each passing minute felt like an eternity.

As Dana leaned against a table for support, the cat that had been lingering nearby stretched up on her leg, its tiny claws scratching at the notebook she was holding. Startled, she glanced down and noticed something she hadn't seen before. In the bottom corner of the cover, partially obscured by a smear of ink, was a faint series of lines that resembled a hastily scribbled message.

It was difficult to read the writing, but two words stood out to Dana: 'higher power.' They reminded her of something Miller had said earlier: 'He makes the rules. I am just his soldier.' She felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up.

"He never answered my question about religion," she thought.

Now that she considered it, it occurred to her that Miller had been far more…unhinged than she'd expected. Could he really have planned the murders on his own? Or had someone helped him?

"Well, I'm off to the press conference," Michaels was saying. "Exemplary work, you two."

Dana watched her boss's retreating figure, still stunned by what she'd just read.

"Are you sure you're okay?" Sam asked, studying Dana's face. "You look pale."

"It's not over, Sam," she said in a hollow voice. "It's not over."

He frowned, gazing at her as if he must be missing something. "What are you talking about? Miller is dead—and don't you dare suggest we got the wrong guy."

"It's not that," she said. "I know Miller killed those women." She paused, choosing her words carefully. "I'm just not convinced he was working alone."

"You think he had a partner?"

Dana glanced down at the notebook again and took a tentative breath. "I think, Sam, he had a boss." 

 

 

 

EPILOGUE
 

 

"This should be interesting," the Admiral muttered as he sat down in his plush armchair, swirling a glass of whiskey. He reached for the remote and turned on the television, which immediately sprang to life on a news station—no great surprise, since the Admiral watched very little else.

"Let's see what the fallout is," he thought, the ice in his drink clinking softly against the crystal tumbler, a soothing sound that matched the amber liquid's slow dance.

On the screen, a reporter stood across the street from John Miller's pawnshop. The reporter was a young man, perhaps in his early thirties, with neatly combed dark hair and an air of confidence that belied his age.

"The pawnshop behind me was owned by John Miller, the man now infamously known as the 'Constitution Killer,'" the reporter said, gesturing toward the building sectioned off with police tape. Patrol cars lined the street, their red and blue lights flashing against the faces of the buildings.

"Authorities are still scouring the premises for evidence, and while Miller is now dead, investigators are determined to uncover the full extent of his crimes," the reporter continued, his voice grave.

The Admiral took another sip of his whiskey, his eyes flickering lazily across the screen. He knew full well what kind of evidence the investigators were looking for. It was the same evidence he had made sure was removed long before anyone could find it—anything that would suggest Miller hadn't been acting alone.

The reporter continued, "It is believed he killed four women, and nearly two more – including an FBI agent – before he was finally stopped."

"Such a tragic loss of life, Tom," the news anchor said from his desk at the studio, his expression somber. "What can you tell us about Miller's motives?"

Tom glanced down at his notes, then back up at the camera. "At this point, there really isn't a lot of clarity about why John Miller did what he did. And since he is no longer alive to explain himself, it is an unfortunate reality that his actions may always remain something of a mystery."

"Indeed," the anchor agreed in a somber voice. "Keep us updated on any new developments, Tom."

"Of course," Tom replied, signing off with a nod.

As the screen cut back to the newsroom, the Admiral frowned, feeling a growing sense of irritation. It wasn't Miller's death that bothered him; rather, it was the fact that his former pawn hadn't managed to get his message across. The reporter hadn't said a single word about the Constitution or the abuses of the current government, for goodness' sake.

Miller had been amateurish, his efforts clumsy and poorly executed. The Admiral chided himself for ever having recruited Miller in the first place.

"Next time," he muttered beneath his breath, "I will have higher standards."

He turned off the television, plunging the room into darkness save for the faint glow of the city outside his window. Leaning back in his chair, the Admiral allowed himself a moment to reflect on the events that had transpired. He swirled the whiskey in his glass, its rich amber hue reflecting the city lights like liquid fire. No matter how Miller's story ended, the wheels were already in motion for something far greater.

The Admiral rose from his chair, the weight of his frustrations momentarily lifting as he took a long sip from the glass in his hand. The whiskey warmed him from within, its smoky flavor a comfort in the face of failure. He walked over to an imposing bookshelf lining one wall of his study, the tomes it held a testament to his obsession with law and order.

Bound in leather, their spines embossed with gold lettering, the books represented a lifetime of study and devotion. Works on constitutional law sat beside treatises on criminal justice and case studies examining landmark rulings. The collection was formidable, evidence of the Admiral's deep and thorough fascination with the Constitution and other forms of law.

He approached the window, looking out at the sprawling cityscape below. Philadelphia stretched out beneath him like a vast, glittering tapestry woven from thousands of tiny points of light. The skyline was a jagged silhouette against the inky sky, daring him to confront the challenges that lay ahead.

"The next one will do better," the Admiral murmured above the hum of the city. "Miller's failure only serves to prove how vital my message is."

He knew he needed to be more careful in choosing his next recruit, someone who was more competent and committed to his cause. The Constitution was under attack, and the Admiral was determined to fight back. He would not rest until the abuses of the government were exposed, and a new order – an order built on his laws, his values – would be established.

As he stared across the city, he thought about how innocent and oblivious all those people were, going about their lives without any inkling of the storm that was brewing. But soon enough, they would know. Soon enough, they would have no choice but to listen.

They would hear his message, and then he would have his revolution.
