WinnieThePooh	48	352	330	378	Bear	"What sort of stories does he like?" "About himself. Because he's _that_ sort of [MASK]." "Oh, I see." "So could you very sweetly?" "I'll try," I said.
WinnieThePooh	57	895	850	907	Pooh	He was getting rather tired by this time, so that is why he sang a Complaining Song. He was nearly there now, and if he just stood on that branch ... _Crack!_ "Oh, help!" said [MASK], as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him.
WinnieThePooh	49	1361	1350	1399	Rabbit	You had had a big green balloon; and one of [MASK]'s relations had had a big blue one, and had left it behind, being really too young to go to a party at all; and so you had brought the green one _and_
WinnieThePooh	49	1417	1415	1464	Pooh	you asked [MASK]. He put his head between his paws and thought very carefully. "It's like this," he said. "When you go after honey with a balloon, the great thing is not to let the bees know you're coming.
WinnieThePooh	49	1782	1753	1802	Pooh	"What do I look like?" "You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon," you said. "Not," said [MASK] anxiously, "--not like a small black cloud in a blue sky?" "Not very much.
WinnieThePooh	51	2373	2372	2423	Christopher--_ow!_--Robin	"[MASK]," called out the cloud. "Yes?" "I have just been thinking, and I have come to a very important decision. _These are the wrong sort of bees._" "Are they?" "Quite the wrong sort.
WinnieThePooh	54	2568	2557	2611	Pooh	"But if you _don't_," said [MASK], "I shall have to let go, and that would spoil _me_." When he put it like this, you saw how it was, and you aimed very carefully at the balloon, and fired.
WinnieThePooh	43	2619	2586	2629	Pooh	" When he put it like this, you saw how it was, and you aimed very carefully at the balloon, and fired. "_Ow!_" said [MASK]. "Did I miss?" you asked.
WinnieThePooh	57	2912	2901	2958	Pooh	"I do remember," he said, "only [MASK] doesn't very well, so that's why he likes having it told to him again. Because then it's a real story and not just a remembering." "That's just how _I_ feel," I said.
WinnieThePooh	56	3343	3288	3344	Pooh	Well, he was humming this hum to himself, and walking along gaily, wondering what everybody else was doing, and what it felt like, being somebody else, when suddenly he came to a sandy bank, and in the bank was a large hole. "Aha!" said [MASK].
WinnieThePooh	48	3470	3454	3502	Pooh	"What I said was, 'Is anybody at home?'" called out [MASK] very loudly. "No!" said a voice; and then added, "You needn't shout so loud. I heard you quite well the first time.
WinnieThePooh	45	3798	3790	3835	Rabbit	"You were quite right," said [MASK], looking at him all over. "It _is_ you. Glad to see you." "Who did you think it was?" "Well, I wasn't sure.
WinnieThePooh	43	3983	3954	3997	Rabbit	And for a long time after that he said nothing ... until at last, humming to himself in a rather sticky voice, he got up, shook [MASK] lovingly by the paw, and said that he must be going on.
WinnieThePooh	55	4050	4041	4096	Rabbit	"As a matter of fact," said [MASK], "I was going out myself directly." "Oh, well, then, I'll be going on. Good-bye." "Well, good-bye, if you're sure you won't have any more.
WinnieThePooh	50	4108	4060	4110	Pooh	" "Oh, well, then, I'll be going on. Good-bye." "Well, good-bye, if you're sure you won't have any more." "_Is_ there any more?" asked [MASK] quickly.
WinnieThePooh	54	4220	4167	4221	Pooh	He pulled with his front paws, and pushed with his back paws, and in a little while his nose was out in the open again ... and then his ears ... and then his front paws ... and then his shoulders ... and then---- "Oh, help!" said [MASK].
WinnieThePooh	50	4781	4742	4792	Pooh	"Then there's only one thing to be done," he said. "We shall have to wait for you to get thin again." "How long does getting thin take?" asked [MASK] anxiously. "About a week, I should think.
WinnieThePooh	42	4926	4893	4935	Pooh	Because, I mean, there they are--doing nothing--and it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them." "A week!" said [MASK] gloomily. "_What about meals?_
WinnieThePooh	50	5115	5110	5160	Pooh	And for a long time [MASK] only said "_Ow!_" ... And "_Oh!_" ... And then, all of a sudden, he said "_Pop!_" just as if a cork were coming out of a bottle.
WinnieThePooh	45	5630	5600	5645	Piglet	"Now, look there." He pointed to the ground in front of him. "What do you see there?" "Tracks," said [MASK]. "Paw-marks." He gave a little squeak of excitement.
WinnieThePooh	41	5671	5651	5692	Pooh	Do you think it's a--a--a Woozle?" "It may be," said [MASK]. "Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. You never can tell with paw-marks.
WinnieThePooh	45	5704	5673	5718	Piglet	"Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. You never can tell with paw-marks." With these few words he went on tracking, and [MASK], after watching him for a minute or two, ran after him.
WinnieThePooh	54	5764	5754	5808	Bear	"It's a very funny thing," said [MASK], "but there seem to be _two_ animals now. This--whatever-it-was--has been joined by another--whatever-it-is--and the two of them are now proceeding in company.
WinnieThePooh	46	6081	6068	6114	Piglet	"_Look!_" "_What?_" said [MASK], with a jump. And then, to show that he hadn't been frightened, he jumped up and down once or twice more in an exercising sort of way.
WinnieThePooh	47	6121	6087	6134	Pooh	And then, to show that he hadn't been frightened, he jumped up and down once or twice more in an exercising sort of way. "The tracks!" said [MASK]. "_A third animal has joined the other two!_
WinnieThePooh	41	6423	6415	6456	Piglet	"I _think_," said [MASK], when he had licked the tip of his nose too, and found that it brought very little comfort, "I _think_ that I have just remembered something.
WinnieThePooh	55	6511	6457	6512	Pooh	I have just remembered something that I forgot to do yesterday and shan't be able to do to-morrow. So I suppose I really ought to go back and do it now." "We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you," said [MASK].
WinnieThePooh	50	7127	7094	7144	Pooh	"Not very how," he said. "I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time." "Dear, dear," said [MASK], "I'm sorry about that. Let's have a look at you."
WinnieThePooh	50	7195	7184	7234	Eeyore	"What _has_ happened to it?" said [MASK]. "It isn't there!" "Are you sure?" "Well, either a tail _is_ there or it isn't there. You can't make a mistake about it.
WinnieThePooh	41	7422	7408	7449	Pooh	"How Like Them," he added, after a long silence. [MASK] felt that he ought to say something helpful about it, but didn't quite know what. So he decided to do something helpful instead.
WinnieThePooh	45	7623	7618	7663	Bear	Through copse and spinney marched [MASK]; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over rocky beds of streams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again; and so at last, tired and hungry, to the Hundred Acre Wood.
WinnieThePooh	41	7947	7912	7953	Owl	Then, to make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the knocker, and he pulled and knocked the bell-rope, and he called out in a very loud voice, "[MASK]! I require an answer!
WinnieThePooh	42	8104	8079	8121	Pooh	" "It means the Thing to Do." "As long as it means that, I don't mind," said [MASK] humbly. "The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Reward.
WinnieThePooh	50	8131	8122	8172	Pooh	Then----" "Just a moment," said [MASK], holding up his paw. "_What_ do we do to this--what you were saying? You sneezed just as you were going to tell me." "I _didn't_ sneeze.
WinnieThePooh	53	8244	8193	8246	Pooh	You can't sneeze without knowing it." "Well, you can't know it without something having been sneezed." "What I _said_ was, 'First _Issue_ a Reward'." "You're doing it again," said [MASK] sadly.
WinnieThePooh	54	8584	8583	8637	Pooh	And [MASK] looked at the knocker and the notice below it, and he looked at the bell-rope and the notice below it, and the more he looked at the bell-rope, the more he felt that he had seen something like it, somewhere else, sometime before.
WinnieThePooh	41	9026	9006	9047	Piglet	"I don't think it saw _me_." "I saw one once," said [MASK]. "At least, I think I did," he said. "Only perhaps it wasn't.
WinnieThePooh	51	9695	9695	9746	Pooh	[MASK] was very proud when he heard this, and he felt that the Heffalump was as good as caught already, but there was just one other thing which had to be thought about, and it was this. _Where should they dig the Very Deep Pit?_
WinnieThePooh	49	9807	9789	9838	Pooh	"Not if he was looking at the sky." "He would Suspect," said [MASK], "if he happened to look down." He thought for a long time and then added sadly, "It isn't as easy as I thought.
WinnieThePooh	44	9890	9863	9907	Pooh	They sighed and got up; and when they had taken a few gorse prickles out of themselves they sat down again; and all the time [MASK] was saying to himself, "If only I could _think_ of something!"
WinnieThePooh	47	10321	10314	10361	Pooh	" "Very well," said [MASK], and he stumped off. As soon as he got home, he went to the larder; and he stood on a chair, and took down a very large jar of honey from the top shelf.
WinnieThePooh	51	10405	10396	10447	Pooh	"But you never can tell," said [MASK]. "I remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just this colour." So he put his tongue in, and took a large lick. "Yes," he said, "it is.
WinnieThePooh	50	10508	10469	10519	Heffalumps	Unless, of course," he said, "somebody put cheese in at the bottom just for a joke. Perhaps I had better go a _little_ further ... just in case ... in case [MASK] _don't_ like cheese ... same as me....
WinnieThePooh	41	10717	10684	10725	Piglet	"And we meet at six o'clock to-morrow morning by the Pine Trees, and see how many Heffalumps we've got in our Trap." "Six o'clock, [MASK]. And have you got any string?
WinnieThePooh	48	10753	10719	10767	Heffalumps	And have you got any string?" "No. Why do you want string?" "To lead them home with." "Oh! ... I _think_ [MASK] come if you whistle." "Some do and some don't.
WinnieThePooh	43	10818	10804	10847	Pooh	Some hours later, just as the night was beginning to steal away, [MASK] woke up suddenly with a sinking feeling. He had had that sinking feeling before, and he knew what it meant. _He was hungry._
WinnieThePooh	49	10910	10874	10923	HUNNY	"That's funny," he thought. "I know I had a jar of honey there. A full jar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had [MASK] written on it, so that I should know it was honey.
WinnieThePooh	50	10979	10930	10980	HUNNY	And then he began to wander up and down, wondering where it was and murmuring a murmur to himself. Like this: It's very, very funny, 'Cos I _know_ I had some honey; 'Cos it had a label on, Saying [MASK].
WinnieThePooh	51	11198	11153	11204	Pooh	For some minutes he lay there miserably, but when the five hundred and eighty-seventh Heffalump was licking its jaws, and saying to itself, "Very good honey this, I don't know when I've tasted better," [MASK] could bear it no longer.
WinnieThePooh	42	11291	11266	11308	Pooh	In the half-light the Pine Trees looked cold and lonely, and the Very Deep Pit seemed deeper than it was, and [MASK]'s jar of honey at the bottom was something mysterious, a shape and no more.
WinnieThePooh	49	11348	11309	11358	Pooh	But as he got nearer to it his nose told him that it was indeed honey, and his tongue came out and began to polish up his mouth, ready for it. "Bother!" said [MASK], as he got his nose inside the jar.
WinnieThePooh	47	11430	11400	11447	Piglet	But there was a little left at the very bottom of the jar, and he pushed his head right in, and began to lick.... By and by [MASK] woke up. As soon as he woke he said to himself, "Oh!"
WinnieThePooh	44	11490	11448	11492	Heffalumps	Then he said bravely, "Yes," and then, still more bravely, "Quite so." But he didn't feel very brave, for the word which was really jiggeting about in his brain was "[MASK]."
WinnieThePooh	44	11601	11571	11615	Pooh	He didn't know the answer to any of these questions ... and he was going to see his first Heffalump in about an hour from now! Of course [MASK] would be with him, and it was much more Friendly with two.
WinnieThePooh	50	11670	11655	11705	Heffalump	But then suppose that it was a very fine day, and there was no [MASK] in the trap, here he would be, in bed all the morning, simply wasting his time for nothing. What should he do? And then he had a Clever Idea.
WinnieThePooh	46	11827	11812	11858	Piglet	"Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!" said [MASK] to himself. And he wanted to run away. But somehow, having got so near, he felt that he must just see what a Heffalump was like.
WinnieThePooh	49	12601	12553	12602	Pooh	"As I thought," he said. "No better from _this_ side. But nobody minds. Nobody cares. Pathetic, that's what it is." There was a crackling noise in the bracken behind him, and out came [MASK].
WinnieThePooh	53	12696	12665	12718	Pooh	We can't all, and some of us don't. That's all there is to it." "Can't all _what_?" said [MASK], rubbing his nose. "Gaiety. Song-and-dance. Here we go round the mulberry bush.
WinnieThePooh	50	12754	12727	12777	Eeyore	He thought for a long time, and then asked, "What mulberry bush is that?" "Bon-hommy," went on [MASK] gloomily. "French word meaning bonhommy," he explained. "I'm not complaining, but There It Is.
WinnieThePooh	47	13062	13038	13085	Eeyore	"Why, what's the matter?" "_Is_ anything the matter?" "You seem so sad, [MASK]." "Sad? Why should I be sad? It's my birthday. The happiest day of the year.
WinnieThePooh	50	13093	13068	13118	Pooh	Why should I be sad? It's my birthday. The happiest day of the year." "Your birthday?" said [MASK] in great surprise. "Of course it is. Can't you see? Look at all the presents I have had."
WinnieThePooh	49	13141	13104	13153	Pooh	Can't you see? Look at all the presents I have had." He waved a foot from side to side. "Look at the birthday cake. Candles and pink sugar." [MASK] looked--first to the right and then to the left.
WinnieThePooh	44	13211	13199	13243	Pooh	"Joke," he explained. "Ha ha!" [MASK] scratched his head, being a little puzzled by all this. "But is it really your birthday?" he asked. "It is." "Oh!
WinnieThePooh	49	13326	13278	13327	Pooh	" "No, it's mine." "But you said 'Many happy returns'----" "Well, why not? You don't always want to be miserable on my birthday, do you?" "Oh, I see," said [MASK].
WinnieThePooh	47	13648	13631	13678	Pooh	"Well, let's go in." So in they went. The first thing [MASK] did was to go to the cupboard to see if he had quite a small jar of honey left; and he had, so he took it down.
WinnieThePooh	47	13730	13718	13765	Pooh	"From both of us?" "No," said [MASK]. "That would _not_ be a good plan." "All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my party.
WinnieThePooh	47	13781	13743	13790	Piglet	" "All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my party. I'll go and get it now, shall I?" "That, [MASK], is a _very_ good idea.
WinnieThePooh	44	13904	13867	13911	Pooh	It began at the tip of his nose and trickled all through him and out at the soles of his feet. It was just as if somebody inside him were saying, "Now then, [MASK], time for a little something.
WinnieThePooh	48	13920	13912	13960	Pooh	" "Dear, dear," said [MASK], "I didn't know it was as late as that." So he sat down and took the top off his jar of honey. "Lucky I brought this with me," he thought.
WinnieThePooh	48	14025	13992	14040	Eeyore	"Now let me see," he thought, as he took his last lick of the inside of the jar, "where was I going? Ah, yes, [MASK]." He got up slowly. And then, suddenly, he remembered.
WinnieThePooh	44	14307	14295	14339	Pooh	"You can keep _anything_ in it," said [MASK] earnestly. "It's Very Useful like that. And I wanted to ask you----" "You ought to write '_A Happy Birthday_' on it.
WinnieThePooh	48	14355	14332	14380	Pooh	A Happy Birthday_' on it." "_That_ was what I wanted to ask you," said [MASK]. "Because my spelling is Wobbly. It's good spelling but it Wobbles, and the letters get in the wrong places.
WinnieThePooh	49	14406	14364	14413	Owl	It's good spelling but it Wobbles, and the letters get in the wrong places. Would _you_ write 'A Happy Birthday' on it for me?" "It's a nice pot," said [MASK], looking at it all round.
WinnieThePooh	48	14433	14414	14462	Pooh	"Couldn't I give it too? From both of us?" "No," said [MASK]. "That would _not_ be a good plan. Now I'll just wash it first, and then you can write on it."
WinnieThePooh	45	14476	14446	14491	Owl	Now I'll just wash it first, and then you can write on it." Well, he washed the pot out, and dried it, while [MASK] licked the end of his pencil, and wondered how to spell "birthday.
WinnieThePooh	52	14770	14762	14814	Eeyore	And running along, and thinking how pleased [MASK] would be, he didn't look where he was going ... and suddenly he put his foot in a rabbit hole, and fell down flat on his face. BANG!!!???***!!!
WinnieThePooh	51	14990	14960	15011	Piglet	And where's my balloon? And what's that small piece of damp rag doing?" It was the balloon! "Oh, dear!" said [MASK] "Oh, dear, oh, dearie, dearie, dear! Well, it's too late now.
WinnieThePooh	49	15134	15091	15140	Piglet	"If it _is_ a good morning," he said. "Which I doubt," said he. "Not that it matters," he said. "Many happy returns of the day," said [MASK], having now got closer.
WinnieThePooh	52	15265	15215	15267	Piglet	"It's quite easy. It's so as I can hear better.... There, that's done it! Now then, what were you saying?" He pushed his ear forward with his hoof. "Many happy returns of the day," said [MASK] again.
WinnieThePooh	41	15417	15409	15450	Eeyore	" "_Balloon?_" said [MASK]. "You did say balloon? One of those big coloured things you blow up? Gaiety, song-and-dance, here we are and there we are?
WinnieThePooh	54	15464	15435	15489	Eeyore	Gaiety, song-and-dance, here we are and there we are?" "Yes, but I'm afraid--I'm very sorry, [MASK]--but when I was running along to bring it you, I fell down." "Dear, dear, how unlucky!
WinnieThePooh	49	15712	15676	15725	Piglet	Red," he murmured to himself. "My favourite colour.... How big was it?" "About as big as me." "I just wondered.... About as big as [MASK]," he said to himself sadly. "My favourite size.
WinnieThePooh	41	15784	15744	15785	Pooh	He was still opening his mouth to begin something, and then deciding that it wasn't any good saying _that_, when he heard a shout from the other side of the river, and there was [MASK].
WinnieThePooh	41	15904	15887	15928	Pooh	"Here it is. And it's got 'A Very Happy Birthday with love from [MASK]' written on it. That's what all that writing is. And it's for putting things in. There!"
WinnieThePooh	41	16161	16160	16201	Eeyore	But [MASK] wasn't listening. He was taking the balloon out, and putting it back again, as happy as could be.... * * * * * "And didn't _I_ give him anything?"
WinnieThePooh	47	16552	16534	16581	Rabbit	"I was forgetting _him_." "Here--we--are," said [MASK] very slowly and carefully, "all--of--us, and then, suddenly, we wake up one morning and, what do we find?
WinnieThePooh	55	16692	16658	16713	Pooh	"And one more for a handkerchief--that's eighteen. Eighteen pockets in one suit! I haven't time." There was a long and thoughtful silence ... and then [MASK], who had been frowning very hard for some minutes, said: "_I_ make it fifteen.
WinnieThePooh	41	17021	17005	17046	Rabbit	in that sort of voice. Sometimes it seemed to him that it did mean what [MASK] said, and sometimes it seemed to him that it didn't. "I suppose it's just practice," he thought.
WinnieThePooh	49	17813	17802	17851	Piglet	As long as we all three say it," said [MASK], "I don't mind," he said, "but I shouldn't care to say '_Aha!_' by myself. It wouldn't sound _nearly_ so well.
WinnieThePooh	58	17909	17852	17910	Pooh	By the way," he said, "you _are_ quite sure about what you said about the winter months?" "The winter months?" "Yes, only being Fierce in the Winter Months." "Oh, yes, yes, that's all right. Well, [MASK]?
WinnieThePooh	49	17956	17928	17977	Kanga	"Not yet," he said. "What _do_ I do?" "Well, you just have to talk very hard to [MASK] so as she doesn't notice anything." "Oh! What about?" "Anything you like.
WinnieThePooh	56	18596	18550	18606	Kanga	On Thursday, when it starts to freeze And hoar-frost twinkles on the trees, How very readily one sees That these are whose--but whose are these? On Friday---- "Yes, it is, isn't it?" said [MASK], not waiting to hear what happened on Friday.
WinnieThePooh	44	19030	19021	19065	Pooh	And in three large jumps she was gone. [MASK] looked after her as she went. "I wish I could jump like that," he thought. "Some can and some can't. That's how it is."
WinnieThePooh	50	19112	19078	19128	Kanga	Often, when he had had a long walk home through the Forest, he had wished that he were a bird; but now he thought jerkily to himself at the bottom of [MASK]'s pocket, this take "If is shall really to flying I never it.
WinnieThePooh	58	19185	19130	19188	Kanga	And as he went up in the air he said, "_Ooooooo!_" and as he came down he said, "_Ow!_" And he was saying, "_Ooooooo-ow, Ooooooo-ow, Ooooooo-ow_" all the way to [MASK]'s house.
WinnieThePooh	41	19559	19556	19597	Piglet	"And imitating [MASK]'s voice too! So clever of him," she went on, as she took a large bar of yellow soap out of the cupboard. "What _will_ he be doing next?
WinnieThePooh	46	19609	19564	19610	Piglet	So clever of him," she went on, as she took a large bar of yellow soap out of the cupboard. "What _will_ he be doing next?" "Can't you _see_?" shouted [MASK].
WinnieThePooh	42	19795	19772	19814	Piglet	"There! What did I tell you?" "You--you--you did it on purpose," spluttered [MASK], as soon as he could speak again ... and then accidentally had another mouthful of lathery flannel.
WinnieThePooh	42	19902	19880	19922	Piglet	"To make you grow big and strong, dear. You don't want to grow up small and weak like [MASK], do you? Well, then!" At that moment there was a knock at the door.
WinnieThePooh	51	20824	20815	20866	Pooh	As soon as he saw the Big Boots, [MASK] knew that an Adventure was going to happen, and he brushed the honey off his nose with the back of his paw, and spruced himself up as well as he could, so as to look Ready for Anything.
WinnieThePooh	41	20902	20886	20927	Pooh	I can't get this boot on." "That's bad," said [MASK]. "Do you think you could very kindly lean against me, 'cos I keep pulling so hard that I fall over backwards.
WinnieThePooh	48	21076	21029	21077	Pooh	"I don't think I've ever been on one of those. Where are we going to on this Expotition?" "Expedition, silly old Bear. It's got an 'x' in it." "Oh!" said [MASK].
WinnieThePooh	52	21239	21189	21241	Pooh	A long line of everybody. You'd better tell the others to get ready, while I see if my gun's all right. And we must all bring Provisions." "Bring what?" "Things to eat." "Oh!" said [MASK] happily.
WinnieThePooh	50	21405	21381	21431	Rabbit	Or was it a Mole? Anyhow we're going to discover it." "We are, are we?" said [MASK]. "Yes. And we've got to bring Pro--things to eat with us. In case we want to eat them.
WinnieThePooh	49	21764	21753	21802	Pooh	I didn't want to come on this Expo--what [MASK] said. I only came to oblige. But here I am; and if I am the end of the Expo--what we're talking about--then let me _be_ the end.
WinnieThePooh	54	21827	21803	21857	Rabbit	But if, every time I want to sit down for a little rest, I have to brush away half a dozen of [MASK]'s smaller friends-and-relations first, then this isn't an Expo--whatever it is--at all, it's simply a Confused Noise.
WinnieThePooh	44	22631	22631	22675	Pooh	[MASK], who now knew what an Ambush was, said that a gorse-bush had sprung at him suddenly one day when he fell off a tree, and he had taken six days to get all the prickles out of himself.
WinnieThePooh	48	22926	22892	22940	Pooh	He looked round at them in his melancholy way. "I suppose none of you are sitting on a thistle by any chance?" "I believe I am," said [MASK]. "Ow!" He got up, and looked behind him.
WinnieThePooh	48	22971	22958	23006	Pooh	If you've quite finished with it." He moved across to [MASK]'s place, and began to eat. "It don't do them any Good, you know, sitting on them," he went on, as he looked up munching.
WinnieThePooh	49	24034	24032	24081	Roo	"Tell [MASK] to be quick, somebody," he said. "My tail's getting cold. I don't want to mention it, but I just mention it. I don't want to complain but there it is. My tail's cold.
WinnieThePooh	53	24090	24045	24098	Roo	"My tail's getting cold. I don't want to mention it, but I just mention it. I don't want to complain but there it is. My tail's cold." "Here I am!" squeaked [MASK]. "Oh, there you are.
WinnieThePooh	49	24108	24092	24141	Eeyore	"Oh, there you are." "Did you see me swimming?" [MASK] took his tail out of the water, and swished it from side to side. "As I expected," he said. "Lost all feeling. Numbed it.
WinnieThePooh	47	24414	24378	24425	Pooh	"My mistake again. I thought you were saying how sorry you were about my tail, being all numb, and could you do anything to help?" "No," said [MASK]. "That wasn't me," he said.
WinnieThePooh	50	25571	25552	25602	Pooh	It's so much more friendly with two." * * * * * When the rain began [MASK] was asleep. It rained, and it rained, and it rained, and he slept and he slept and he slept. He had had a tiring day.
WinnieThePooh	46	25928	25891	25937	Pooh	there he was, sitting in his chair with his feet in the water, and water all round him! He splashed to his door and looked out... "This is Serious," said [MASK]. "I must have an Escape."
WinnieThePooh	55	26124	26119	26174	Pooh	"Bother!" said [MASK], as he opened it. "All that wet for nothing. What's that bit of paper doing?" He took it out and looked at it. "It's a Missage," he said to himself, "that's what it is.
WinnieThePooh	44	26200	26175	26219	Pooh	And that letter is a 'P,' and so is that, and so is that, and 'P' means '[MASK],' so it's a very important Missage to me, and I can't read it.
WinnieThePooh	49	26919	26909	26958	Pooh	In a little while he was back again. "[MASK] isn't there," he said. "Not there?" "Has _been_ there. He's been sitting on a branch of his tree outside his house with nine pots of honey.
WinnieThePooh	50	27039	27032	27082	Pooh	"On my boat," said [MASK] proudly. "I had a Very Important Missage sent me in a bottle, and owing to having got some water in my eyes, I couldn't read it, so I brought it to you. On my boat.
WinnieThePooh	45	27230	27201	27246	Pooh	"It is doubtful if the necessary dorsal muscles----" "Then would you fly to him at _once_ and say that Rescue is Coming? And [MASK] and I will think of a Rescue and come as quick as ever we can.
WinnieThePooh	51	27381	27340	27391	Pooh	It all depends." "Depends on what?" "On whether I'm on the top of it or underneath it." "Oh! Well, where is it?" "There!" said [MASK], pointing proudly to _The Floating Bear_.
WinnieThePooh	50	28647	28631	28681	Bear	I thought you knew; He saved his friend from a wetting! 3 Cheers for [MASK]! (_For where?_) For Bear-- He couldn't swim, But he rescued him! (_He rescued who?_) Oh, listen, do!
WinnieThePooh	47	28913	28906	28953	Eeyore	" "Very interesting," said [MASK]. "I suppose they will be sending me down the odd bits which got trodden on. Kind and Thoughtful. Not at all, don't mention it." "There is an Invitation for you.
WinnieThePooh	51	29000	28954	29005	Eeyore	" "What's that like?" "An Invitation!" "Yes, I heard you. Who dropped it?" "This isn't anything to eat, it's asking you to the party. To-morrow." [MASK] shook his head slowly.
WinnieThePooh	45	29990	29967	30012	Eeyore	"Of course it is. The best bear in all the world." "I might have known," said [MASK]. "After all, one can't complain. I have my friends. Somebody spoke to me only yesterday.
WinnieThePooh	49	30023	29992	30041	Rabbit	"After all, one can't complain. I have my friends. Somebody spoke to me only yesterday. And was it last week or the week before that [MASK] bumped into me and said 'Bother!' The Social Round. Always something going on.
WinnieThePooh	55	30093	30067	30122	Pooh	"I know what it is," "No, you don't" and other helpful remarks of this sort. And of course [MASK] was opening it as quickly as ever he could, but without cutting the string, because you never know when a bit of string might be Useful.
WinnieThePooh	47	30605	30578	30625	Pooh	At the door he turned and said "Coming to see me have my bath?" "I might," I said. "Was [MASK]'s pencil case any better than mine?" "It was just the same," I said.
