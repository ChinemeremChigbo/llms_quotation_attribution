HardTimes	43	2186	2186	2229	Sissy	[MASK] blushed, and stood up. "So you would carpet your room or your husband's room, if you were a grown woman, and had a husband with representations of flowers, would you?" said the gentleman.
HardTimes	54	2982	2952	3006	Morgiana	If he had only learnt a little less, how infinitely better he might have taught much more! He went to work in this preparatory lesson, not unlike [MASK] in the Forty Thieves: looking into all the vessels ranged before him, one after another, to see what they contained.
HardTimes	55	3224	3192	3247	Heaven	Not that they knew, by name or nature, anything about an Ogre Fact forbid! I only use the word to express a monster in a lecturing castle, with [MASK] knows how many heads manipulated into one, taking childhood captive, and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by the hair.
HardTimes	58	4755	4732	4790	Thomas	Would have been self-willed (he thought in his eminently practical way) but for her bringing-up. "[MASK], though I have the fact before me, I find it difficult to believe that you, with your education and resources, should have brought your sister to a scene like this.
HardTimes	48	4944	4922	4970	Louisa	I am amazed." "I was tired, father. I have been tired a long time," said [MASK]. "Tired? Of what?" asked the astonished father. "I don't know of what of everything, I think.
HardTimes	51	5028	4988	5039	Louisa	I will hear no more." He did not speak again until they had walked some half-a-mile in silence, when he gravely broke out with: "What would your best friends say, [MASK]? Do you attach no value to their good opinion?
HardTimes	42	5838	5822	5864	Bounderby	"How I fought through it, _I_ don't know," said [MASK]. "I was determined, I suppose. I have been a determined character in later life, and I suppose I was then.
HardTimes	54	6058	6048	6102	Bounderby	"She kept a chandler's shop," pursued [MASK], "and kept me in an egg-box. That was the cot of _my_ infancy; an old egg-box. As soon as I was big enough to run away, of course I ran away.
HardTimes	48	6508	6473	6521	Louisa	He stopped just as his eminently practical friend, still accompanied by the two young culprits, entered the room. His eminently practical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave [MASK] a reproachful look that plainly said, "Behold your Bounderby!"
HardTimes	52	6830	6779	6831	Louisa	I am sure you have enough to do, if that's what you want. With my head in its present state, I couldn't remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to." "That's the reason!" pouted [MASK].
HardTimes	42	7212	7193	7235	Bounderby	" "There certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds," returned [MASK]. "When I was a vagabond myself, nobody looked with any interest at _me_; I know that.
HardTimes	53	7390	7365	7418	Gradgrind	Whoever expects refinement in _me_ will be disappointed. I hadn't a refined bringing up." "Whether," said [MASK], pondering with his hands in his pockets, and his cavernous eyes on the fire, "whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything?
HardTimes	49	7484	7476	7525	Bounderby	" "Stop a bit!" cried [MASK], who all this time had been standing, as before, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility. "You have one of those strollers' children in the school.
HardTimes	41	7558	7549	7590	Bounderby	"Now, stop a bit!" cried [MASK] again. "How did she come there?" "Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now.
HardTimes	54	7617	7568	7622	Bounderby	" "Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now. She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and yes, you are right, [MASK], you are right.
HardTimes	51	7813	7795	7846	Bounderby	" "I am much of your opinion." "Do it at once," said [MASK], "has always been my motto from a child. When I thought I would run away from my egg-box and my grandmother, I did it at once.
HardTimes	47	8267	8262	8309	Louisa	"Good-bye, [MASK]!" He went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he had kissed, with her handkerchief, until it was burning red. She was still doing this, five minutes afterwards.
HardTimes	53	8316	8270	8323	Loo	He went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he had kissed, with her handkerchief, until it was burning red. She was still doing this, five minutes afterwards. "What are you about, [MASK]?" her brother sulkily remonstrated.
HardTimes	44	10051	10034	10078	Bitzer	"What are you doing? How dare you dash against everybody in this manner?" [MASK] picked up his cap, which the concussion had knocked off; and backing, and knuckling his forehead, pleaded that it was an accident.
HardTimes	51	10116	10094	10145	Bitzer	"Yes, sir," said the girl reluctantly. "No, I wasn't, sir!" cried [MASK]. "Not till she run away from me. But the horse-riders never mind what they say, sir; they're famous for it.
HardTimes	46	10163	10118	10164	Sissy	"Not till she run away from me. But the horse-riders never mind what they say, sir; they're famous for it. You know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they say," addressing [MASK].
HardTimes	49	10223	10200	10249	Bitzer	"He frightened me so," said the girl, "with his cruel faces!" "Oh!" cried [MASK]. "Oh! An't you one of the rest! An't you a horse-rider! I never looked at her, sir.
HardTimes	42	10376	10376	10418	Jupe	[MASK], stay here a moment. Let me hear of your running in this manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the master of the school. You understand what I mean. Go along.
HardTimes	59	10435	10383	10442	Sissy	Let me hear of your running in this manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the master of the school. You understand what I mean. Go along." The boy stopped in his rapid blinking, knuckled his forehead again, glanced at [MASK], turned about, and retreated.
HardTimes	51	10932	10887	10938	Merrylegs	"It's only crossing the bar, sir, and up the stairs, if you wouldn't mind, and waiting there for a moment till I get a candle. If you should hear a dog, sir, it's only [MASK], and he only barks.
HardTimes	55	11194	11160	11215	Merrylegs	They followed the girl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one, and stopped in the dark while she went on for a candle. They expected every moment to hear [MASK] give tongue, but the highly trained performing dog had not barked when the girl and the candle appeared together.
HardTimes	52	11258	11237	11289	Sissy	"If you wouldn't mind walking in, I'll find him directly." They walked in; and [MASK], having set two chairs for them, sped away with a quick light step. It was a mean, shabbily furnished room, with a bed in it.
HardTimes	45	11358	11356	11401	Merrylegs	As to [MASK], that respectable ancestor of the highly trained animal who went aboard the ark, might have been accidentally shut out of it, for any sign of a dog that was manifest to eye or ear in the Pegasus's Arms.
HardTimes	49	12428	12403	12452	Cupid	"Queer sort of company, too, for a man who has raised himself!" "Lower yourself, then," retorted [MASK]. "Oh Lord! if you've raised yourself so high as all that comes to, let yourself down a bit.
HardTimes	46	12817	12801	12847	Childers	"His joints are turning stiff, and he is getting used up," said [MASK]. "He has his points as a Cackler still, but he can't get a living out of _them_." "A Cackler!"
HardTimes	52	12951	12946	12998	Gradgrind	"This is good, [MASK]! A man so fond of his daughter, that he runs away from her! This is devilish good! Ha! ha! Now, I'll tell you what, young man. I haven't always occupied my present station of life.
HardTimes	50	13049	13043	13093	Bounderby	"Very well," said [MASK]. "I was born in a ditch, and my mother ran away from me. Do I excuse her for it? No. Have I ever excused her for it? Not I. What do I call her for it?
HardTimes	58	13406	13405	13463	Jupe	"[MASK] sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago, and then was seen to slip out himself, with his hat over his eyes, and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm. She will never believe it of him, but he has cut away and left her.
HardTimes	52	14082	14039	14091	Bounderby	"I came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school, and that she must not attend any more. Still, if her father really has left her, without any connivance on her part [MASK], let me have a word with you.

HardTimes	41	15758	15740	15781	Sleary	These observations comprise the whole of the case." "At the thame time," said [MASK], "I mutht put in my word, Thquire, tho that both thides of the banner may be equally theen.

HardTimes	50	16419	16385	16435	Sissy	The women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes together it was soon done, for they were not many and to pack them in a basket which had often travelled with them. [MASK] sat all the time upon the ground, still sobbing, and covering her eyes.
HardTimes	54	16721	16676	16730	Sissy	Opening his arms wide he took her by both her hands, and would have sprung her up and down, after the riding-master manner of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from a rapid act; but there was no rebound in [MASK], and she only stood before him crying.
HardTimes	48	17070	17023	17071	Thethilia	He had never thought of going away, when he sent me for it. I must keep it for him, if you please!" "Tho be it, my dear. (You thee how it ith, Thquire!) Farewell, [MASK]!

HardTimes	57	17982	17942	17999	Bounderby	" Nay, he made this foil of his so very widely known, that third parties took it up, and handled it on some occasions with considerable briskness. It was one of the most exasperating attributes of [MASK], that he not only sang his own praises but stimulated other men to sing them.
HardTimes	46	20422	20394	20440	M'Choakumchild	Never wonder. By means of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, settle everything somehow, and never wonder. Bring to me, says [MASK], yonder baby just able to walk, and I will engage that it shall never wonder.
HardTimes	50	21229	21217	21267	Tom	I don't know what this jolly old Jaundiced Jail," [MASK] had paused to find a sufficiently complimentary and expressive name for the parental roof, and seemed to relieve his mind for a moment by the strong alliteration of this one, "would be without you.
HardTimes	54	21302	21274	21328	Tom	Do you really and truly say so?" "Why, of course I do. What's the use of talking about it!" returned [MASK], chafing his face on his coat-sleeve, as if to mortify his flesh, and have it in unison with his spirit.
HardTimes	57	21332	21329	21386	Tom	"Because, [MASK]," said his sister, after silently watching the sparks awhile, "as I get older, and nearer growing up, I often sit wondering here, and think how unfortunate it is for me that I can't reconcile you to home better than I am able to do.
HardTimes	44	21524	21483	21527	Tom	If father was determined to make me either a Prig or a Mule, and I am not a Prig, why, it stands to reason, I must be a Mule. And so I am," said [MASK], desperately.
HardTimes	51	21640	21609	21660	Tom	You are the only pleasure I have you can brighten even this place and you can always lead me as you like." "You are a dear brother, [MASK]; and while you think I can do such things, I don't so much mind knowing better.
HardTimes	59	21708	21691	21750	Tom	"I wish I could collect all the Facts we hear so much about," said [MASK], spitefully setting his teeth, "and all the Figures, and all the people who found them out: and I wish I could put a thousand barrels of gunpowder under them, and blow them all up together!
HardTimes	44	21773	21768	21812	Tom	" "Your revenge, [MASK]?" "I mean, I'll enjoy myself a little, and go about and see something, and hear something. I'll recompense myself for the way in which I have been brought up.
HardTimes	51	22375	22326	22377	Tom	But I must go, you know, whether I like it or not; and I had better go where I can take with me some advantage of your influence, than where I should lose it altogether. Don't you see?" "Yes, [MASK]."
HardTimes	51	22395	22378	22429	Tom	The answer was so long in coming, though there was no indecision in it, that [MASK] went and leaned on the back of her chair, to contemplate the fire which so engrossed her, from her point of view, and see what he could make of it.
HardTimes	45	22477	22456	22501	Tom	What do you see in it? Not a circus?" "I don't see anything in it, [MASK], particularly. But since I have been looking at it, I have been wondering about you and me, grown up.
HardTimes	49	22509	22481	22530	Tom	But since I have been looking at it, I have been wondering about you and me, grown up." "Wondering again!" said [MASK]. "I have such unmanageable thoughts," returned his sister, "that they _will_ wonder.
HardTimes	51	22781	22771	22822	Louisa	Don't stand there and tell me such stuff, [MASK], to my face, when you know very well that if it was ever to reach your father's ears I should never hear the last of it. After all the trouble that has been taken with you!
HardTimes	49	23870	23843	23892	Louisa	But isn't it the same?" she timidly asked. "You had better say, National, as he said so," returned [MASK], with her dry reserve. "National Prosperity. And he said, Now, this schoolroom is a Nation.
HardTimes	48	23940	23893	23941	Louisa	And in this nation, there are fifty millions of money. Isn't this a prosperous nation? Girl number twenty, isn't this a prosperous nation, and a'n't you in a thriving state?" "What did you say?" asked [MASK].
HardTimes	52	24317	24310	24362	Sissy	I shall never learn," said [MASK]. "And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don't like it.
HardTimes	50	24575	24566	24616	Louisa	" "Did your father love her?" [MASK] asked these questions with a strong, wild, wandering interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a banished creature, and hiding in solitary places. "O yes! As dearly as he loves me.
HardTimes	52	24657	24627	24679	Sissy	He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby. We have never been asunder from that time." "Yet he leaves you now, [MASK]?" "Only for my good. Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I do.
HardTimes	56	24733	24708	24764	Louisa	He will not be happy for a single minute, till he comes back." "Tell me more about him," said [MASK], "I will never ask you again. Where did you live?" "We travelled about the country, and had no fixed place to live in.
HardTimes	49	24790	24780	24829	Louisa	" "To make the people laugh?" said [MASK], with a nod of intelligence. "Yes. But they wouldn't laugh sometimes, and then father cried. Lately, they very often wouldn't laugh, and he used to come home despairing.
HardTimes	57	25370	25337	25394	Louisa	And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face." [MASK] saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her.
HardTimes	41	25406	25395	25436	Sissy	"Finish by telling me how your father left you, [MASK]. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.
HardTimes	49	25745	25744	25793	Sissy	" [MASK] resumed in a lower voice. "At last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again, and never did give any satisfaction now, and that he was a shame and disgrace, and I should have done better without him all along.
HardTimes	46	26540	26538	26584	STEPHEN	CHAPTER X [MASK] BLACKPOOL I ENTERTAIN a weak idea that the English people are as hard-worked as any people upon whom the sun shines. I acknowledge to this ridiculous idiosyncrasy, as a reason why I would give them a little more play.
HardTimes	56	26832	26807	26863	Stephen	It is said that every life has its roses and thorns; there seemed, however, to have been a misadventure or mistake in [MASK]'s case, whereby somebody else had become possessed of his roses, and he had become possessed of the same somebody else's thorns in addition to his own.
HardTimes	48	27163	27157	27205	Rachael	"Yet I don't see [MASK], still!" said he. It was a wet night, and many groups of young women passed him, with their shawls drawn over their bare heads and held close under their chins to keep the rain out.
HardTimes	58	27208	27206	27264	Rachael	He knew [MASK] well, for a glance at any one of these groups was sufficient to show him that she was not there. At last, there were no more to come; and then he turned away, saying in a tone of disappointment, "Why, then, ha' missed her!"
HardTimes	51	27783	27746	27797	Rachael	'Twould be hard, indeed, if 'twas not to be at all," she said, with a cheerfulness she sought to communicate to him. "'Tis hard, anyways, [MASK]." "Try to think not; and 'twill seem better.
HardTimes	49	27835	27828	27877	Rachael	Thou hast been that to me, [MASK], through so many year: thou hast done me so much good, and heartened of me in that cheering way, that thy word is a law to me. Ah, lass, and a bright good law!
HardTimes	50	27891	27878	27928	Stephen	Better than some real ones." "Never fret about them, [MASK]," she answered quickly, and not without an anxious glance at his face. "Let the laws be." "Yes," he said, with a slow nod or two.
HardTimes	54	27961	27943	27997	Rachael	'Tis a muddle, and that's aw." "Always a muddle?" said [MASK], with another gentle touch upon his arm, as if to recall him out of the thoughtfulness, in which he was biting the long ends of his loose neckerchief as he walked along.
HardTimes	48	28033	27998	28046	Rachael	The touch had its instantaneous effect. He let them fall, turned a smiling face upon her, and said, as he broke into a good-humoured laugh, "Ay, [MASK], lass, awlus a muddle. That's where I stick.
HardTimes	50	29142	29104	29154	Stephen	A clattering of clogs upon the pavement; a rapid ringing of bells; and all the melancholy mad elephants, polished and oiled up for the day's monotony, were at their heavy exercise again. [MASK] bent over his loom, quiet, watchful, and steady.
HardTimes	51	29169	29155	29206	Stephen	A special contrast, as every man was in the forest of looms where [MASK] worked, to the crashing, smashing, tearing piece of mechanism at which he laboured. Never fear, good people of an anxious turn of mind, that Art will consign Nature to oblivion.
HardTimes	53	29522	29488	29541	Stephen	The work went on, until the noon-bell rang. More clattering upon the pavements. The looms, and wheels, and Hands all out of gear for an hour. [MASK] came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets, haggard and worn.
HardTimes	54	30320	30308	30362	Stephen	"Fire away!" "I ha' coom," [MASK] began, raising his eyes from the floor, after a moment's consideration, "to ask yo yor advice. I need 't overmuch. I were married on Eas'r Monday nineteen year sin, long and dree.
HardTimes	49	30389	30349	30398	Gonnows	I were married on Eas'r Monday nineteen year sin, long and dree. She were a young lass pretty enow wi' good accounts of herseln. Well! She went bad soon. Not along of me. [MASK] I were not a unkind husband to her.
HardTimes	47	31225	31217	31264	Bounderby	"What do you mean?" said [MASK], getting up to lean his back against the chimney-piece. "What are you talking about? You took her for better for worse." "I mun' be ridden o' her.
HardTimes	49	31952	31942	31991	Stephen	"There _is_ such a law." [MASK], subsiding into his quiet manner, and never wandering in his attention, gave a nod. "But it's not for you at all. It costs money. It costs a mint of money.
HardTimes	53	32129	32107	32160	Stephen	" "There's no other law?" "Certainly not." "Why then, sir," said [MASK], turning white, and motioning with that right hand of his, as if he gave everything to the four winds, ""_tis_ a muddle.
HardTimes	43	32330	32298	32341	Stephen	If she has turned out worse why, all we have got to say is, she might have turned out better." "'Tis a muddle," said [MASK], shaking his head as he moved to the door.
HardTimes	59	33065	33036	33095	Stephen	"I believe it was you, unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following?" "Yes, missus," returned [MASK], "it were me." "Have you you'll excuse an old woman's curiosity have you seen the gentleman?" "Yes, missus.
HardTimes	51	33141	33106	33157	Stephen	Was he portly, bold, outspoken, and hearty?" As she straightened her own figure, and held up her head in adapting her action to her words, the idea crossed [MASK] that he had seen this old woman before, and had not quite liked her.
HardTimes	54	33200	33177	33231	Stephen	" "And healthy," said the old woman, "as the fresh wind?" "Yes," returned [MASK]. "He were ett'n and drinking as large and as loud as a Hummobee." "Thank you!" said the old woman, with infinite content.
HardTimes	50	33487	33463	33513	Stephen	I come regular, to tramp about the streets, and see the gentlemen." "Only to see 'em?" returned [MASK]. "That's enough for me," she replied, with great earnestness and interest of manner. "I ask no more!
HardTimes	47	33613	33588	33635	Stephen	I have seen you, and you have seen him, and I must make that do." Saying this, she looked at [MASK] as if to fix his features in her mind, and her eye was not so bright as it had been.
HardTimes	50	33908	33863	33913	Stephen	"Times. Just now and then," he answered, slightly. "But, working under such a gentleman, they don't follow you to the Factory?" No, no; they didn't follow him there, said [MASK]. All correct there.
HardTimes	50	35136	35114	35164	Rachael	He went up to his door, opened it, and so into the room. Quiet and peace were there. [MASK] was there, sitting by the bed. She turned her head, and the light of her face shone in upon the midnight of his mind.
HardTimes	53	35201	35165	35218	Rachael	She sat by the bed, watching and tending his wife. That is to say, he saw that some one lay there, and he knew too well it must be she; but [MASK]'s hands had put a curtain up, so that she was screened from his eyes.
HardTimes	43	35228	35219	35262	Rachael	Her disgraceful garments were removed, and some of [MASK]'s were in the room. Everything was in its place and order as he had always kept it, the little fire was newly trimmed, and the hearth was freshly swept.
HardTimes	47	35273	35235	35282	Rachael	Everything was in its place and order as he had always kept it, the little fire was newly trimmed, and the hearth was freshly swept. It appeared to him that he saw all this in [MASK]'s face, and looked at nothing besides.
HardTimes	54	35362	35326	35380	Stephen	She turned again towards the bed, and satisfying herself that all was quiet there, spoke in a low, calm, cheerful voice. "I am glad you have come at last, [MASK]. You are very late." "I ha' been walking up an' down.
HardTimes	51	35463	35413	35464	Stephen	True. It was blowing hard. Hark to the thundering in the chimney, and the surging noise! To have been out in such a wind, and not to have known it was blowing! "I have been here once before, to-day, [MASK].
HardTimes	49	35500	35475	35524	Stephen	There was some one here that needed looking to, she said. And "deed she was right. All wandering and lost, [MASK]. Wounded too, and bruised." He slowly moved to a chair and sat down, drooping his head before her.
HardTimes	54	35535	35525	35579	Stephen	"I came to do what little I could, [MASK]; first, for that she worked with me when we were girls both, and for that you courted her and married her when I was her friend " He laid his furrowed forehead on his hand, with a low groan.
HardTimes	49	35661	35620	35669	Stephen	Thou knowest who said, "Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone at her!" There have been plenty to do that. Thou art not the man to cast the last stone, [MASK], when she is brought so low.
HardTimes	49	35820	35807	35856	Stephen	This was one. It was not so far off, but that [MASK], following her hands with his eyes, could read what was printed on it in large letters. He turned of a deadly hue, and a sudden horror seemed to fall upon him.
HardTimes	52	36047	36018	36070	Stephen	She had cast it out; she would keep it out; he trusted to her to defend him from himself. "She don't know me, [MASK]; she just drowsily mutters and stares. I have spoken to her times and again, but she don't notice!
HardTimes	53	36251	36250	36303	Stephen	"[MASK]!" She was coming to him, but he stretched out his arm to stop her. "No! Don't, please; don't. Let me see thee setten by the bed. Let me see thee, a' so good, and so forgiving.
HardTimes	51	36375	36348	36399	Rachael	After a time he controlled himself, and, resting with an elbow on one knee, and his head upon that hand, could look towards [MASK]. Seen across the dim candle with his moistened eyes, she looked as if she had a glory shining round her head.
HardTimes	48	36441	36435	36483	Stephen	"When she gets better, [MASK], 'tis to be hoped she'll leave thee to thyself again, and do thee no more hurt. Anyways we will hope so now. And now I shall keep silence, for I want thee to sleep.
HardTimes	59	36591	36553	36612	Rachael	Even this imperfect consciousness faded away at last, and he dreamed a long, troubled dream. He thought that he, and some one on whom his heart had long been set but she was not [MASK], and that surprised him, even in the midst of his imaginary happiness stood in the church being married.
HardTimes	56	37126	37126	37182	Rachael	[MASK] seemed to have fallen into a doze, in the chair by the bed. She sat wrapped in her shawl, perfectly still. The table stood in the same place, close by the bedside, and on it, in its real proportions and appearance, was the shape so often repeated.
HardTimes	44	37302	37268	37312	Rachael	Her eyes returned to that corner, and she put her hand over them as a shade, while she looked into it. Again they went all round the room, scarcely heeding [MASK] if at all, and returned to that corner.
HardTimes	47	37612	37609	37656	Rachael	She looked at [MASK], and very slowly, very cautiously, poured out the contents. The draught was at her lips. A moment and she would be past all help, let the whole world wake and come about her with its utmost power.
HardTimes	42	37661	37626	37668	Rachael	The draught was at her lips. A moment and she would be past all help, let the whole world wake and come about her with its utmost power. But in that moment [MASK] started up with a suppressed cry.
HardTimes	49	37717	37710	37759	Stephen	" "'Tis all well, [MASK]. I have been asleep, myself. 'Tis near three. Hush! I hear the bells." The wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the window. They listened, and it struck three.
HardTimes	49	37760	37752	37801	Stephen	They listened, and it struck three. [MASK] looked at her, saw how pale she was, noted the disorder of her hair, and the red marks of fingers on her forehead, and felt assured that his senses of sight and hearing had been awake.
HardTimes	45	38018	37975	38020	Stephen	" "Thou'rt not fearfo';" he said it in a low voice, as they went out at the door; "to leave me alone wi' her!" As she looked at him, saying, "[MASK]?"
HardTimes	53	38070	38047	38100	Stephen	"Thou art an Angel. Bless thee, bless thee!" "I am, as I have told thee, [MASK], thy poor friend. Angels are not like me. Between them, and a working woman fu' of faults, there is a deep gulf set.
HardTimes	46	38387	38357	38403	Rachael	He caught them in his unoccupied hand, and holding them, and still clasping the border of her shawl, said hurriedly: "But I see thee, [MASK], setten by the bed. I ha' seen thee, aw this night.
HardTimes	48	38418	38394	38442	Evermore	I ha' seen thee, aw this night. In my troublous sleep I ha' known thee still to be there. [MASK] I will see thee there. I nevermore will see her or think o' her, but thou shalt be beside her.
HardTimes	46	38632	38603	38649	Rachael	He stood bare-headed in the road, watching her quick disappearance. As the shining stars were to the heavy candle in the window, so was [MASK], in the rugged fancy of this man, to the common experiences of his life.
HardTimes	49	39361	39318	39367	Sissy	"Don't shed tears. I don't complain of you. You are an affectionate, earnest, good young woman and and we must make that do." "Thank you, sir, very much," said [MASK], with a grateful curtsey.
HardTimes	42	40057	40028	40070	Louisa	Come to me in my room after breakfast to-morrow, will you?" "Yes, father." "Your hands are rather cold, [MASK]. Are you not well?" "Quite well, father.
HardTimes	45	40129	40119	40164	Louisa	So, he kissed her and went away; and [MASK] returned to the serene apartment of the hair-cutting character, and leaning her elbow on her hand, looked again at the short-lived sparks that so soon subsided into ashes.
HardTimes	48	40330	40301	40349	Tom	But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the morning." "Ah! That's what I mean," said [MASK]. "Do you know where he is to-night?" with a very deep expression.
HardTimes	44	40421	40411	40455	Louisa	" With her hand upon her brother's shoulder, [MASK] still stood looking at the fire. Her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than usual, and, encircling her waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him.
HardTimes	42	40502	40492	40534	Tom	" "Well, sister of mine," said [MASK], "when you say that, you are near my thoughts. We might be so much oftener together mightn't we? Always together, almost mightn't we?
HardTimes	51	40557	40516	40567	Loo	We might be so much oftener together mightn't we? Always together, almost mightn't we? It would do me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to I know what, [MASK]. It would be a splendid thing for me.
HardTimes	51	40618	40568	40619	Loo	It would be uncommonly jolly!" Her thoughtfulness baffled his cunning scrutiny. He could make nothing of her face. He pressed her in his arm, and kissed her cheek. She returned the kiss, but still looked at the fire. "I say, [MASK]!
HardTimes	44	41258	41234	41278	Louisa	" He waited, as if he would have been glad that she said something. But she said never a word. "[MASK], my dear, you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has been made to me.
HardTimes	53	41503	41455	41508	Louisa	He took a paper-knife in his hand, turned it over, laid it down, took it up again, and even then had to look along the blade of it, considering how to go on. "What you say, my dear [MASK], is perfectly reasonable.
HardTimes	48	41810	41773	41821	Louisa	Yes or No, father?" "Certainly, my dear. Because;" here was something to demonstrate, and it set him up again; "because the reply depends so materially, [MASK], on the sense in which we use the expression.
HardTimes	43	42289	42278	42321	Louisa	" "What do you recommend, father," asked [MASK], her reserved composure not in the least affected by these gratifying results, "that I should substitute for the term I used just now? For the misplaced expression?
HardTimes	43	42402	42367	42410	Louisa	Yes, he does. The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him? I think nothing can be plainer than that?" "Shall I marry him?" repeated [MASK], with great deliberation. "Precisely.
HardTimes	49	42424	42408	42457	Louisa	"Precisely. And it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear [MASK], to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind, and habits of life, that belong to many young women.
HardTimes	48	42530	42489	42537	Louisa	"I have stated the case, as such cases are usually stated among practical minds; I have stated it, as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time. The rest, my dear [MASK], is for you to decide.
HardTimes	49	42753	42719	42768	Louisa	Removing her eyes from him, she sat so long looking silently towards the town, that he said, at length: "Are you consulting the chimneys of the Coketown works, [MASK]?" "There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke.
HardTimes	49	42795	42769	42818	Louisa	Yet when the night comes, Fire bursts out, father!" she answered, turning quickly. "Of course I know that, [MASK]. I do not see the application of the remark." To do him justice he did not, at all.
HardTimes	52	43266	43249	43301	Louisa	He paused to look at her, and, still holding her hand, said: "[MASK], I have not considered it essential to ask you one question, because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote. But perhaps I ought to do so.
HardTimes	54	43395	43374	43428	Louisa	I merely wished to discharge my duty." "What do _I_ know, father," said [MASK] in her quiet manner, "of tastes and fancies; of aspirations and affections; of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished?
HardTimes	52	43767	43726	43778	Louisa	It has always been my object so to educate you, as that you might, while still in your early youth, be (if I may so express myself) almost any age. Kiss me once more, [MASK]. Now, let us go and find your mother.
HardTimes	56	43807	43779	43835	Sissy	" Accordingly, they went down to the drawing-room, where the esteemed lady with no nonsense about her, was recumbent as usual, while [MASK] worked beside her. She gave some feeble signs of returning animation when they entered, and presently the faint transparency was presented in a sitting attitude.
HardTimes	59	43985	43946	44005	Louisa	However, I give you joy, my dear and I hope you may now turn all your ological studies to good account, I am sure I do! I must give you a kiss of congratulation, [MASK]; but don't touch my right shoulder, for there's something running down it all day long.
HardTimes	52	44142	44136	44188	Joe	You yourself wouldn't hear of [MASK], you very well know. Am I to call my own son-in-law, Mister! Not, I believe, unless the time has arrived when, as an invalid, I am to be trampled upon by my relations.
HardTimes	56	45282	45275	45331	Bounderby	"Well, ma'am," resumed [MASK], "under these circumstances, I imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here, though you would be very welcome here." "Oh, dear no, sir, I could on no account think of that!"
HardTimes	51	45379	45372	45423	Bounderby	"However, ma'am," said [MASK], "there are apartments at the Bank, where a born and bred lady, as keeper of the place, would be rather a catch than otherwise; and if the same terms " "I beg your pardon, sir.
HardTimes	42	45524	45483	45525	Bounderby	"The proposal is like yourself, and if the position I shall assume at the Bank is one that I could occupy without descending lower in the social scale " "Why, of course it is," said [MASK].
HardTimes	42	45862	45823	45865	Victim	She was polite, obliging, cheerful, hopeful; but, the more polite, the more obliging, the more cheerful, the more hopeful, the more exemplary altogether, she; the forlorner Sacrifice and [MASK], he.
HardTimes	45	49804	49796	49841	Bitzer	"An individual, ma'am," said [MASK], "has never been what he ought to have been, since he first came into the place. He is a dissipated, extravagant idler. He is not worth his salt, ma'am.
HardTimes	43	49889	49880	49923	Bitzer	"I only hope, ma'am," pursued [MASK], "that his friend and relation may not supply him with the means of carrying on. Otherwise, ma'am, we know out of whose pocket _that_ money comes.
HardTimes	55	50002	49981	50036	Bitzer	"I have always pitied the delusion, always." "As to an individual, ma'am," said [MASK], dropping his voice and drawing nearer, "he is as improvident as any of the people in this town. And you know what _their_ improvidence is, ma'am.
HardTimes	51	50253	50233	50284	Bitzer	Why don't you go and do it? "As to their wanting recreations, ma'am," said [MASK], "it's stuff and nonsense. _I_ don't want recreations. I never did, and I never shall; I don't like 'em.
HardTimes	43	50395	50370	50413	Bitzer	"I am sure we are constantly hearing, ma'am, till it becomes quite nauseous, concerning their wives and families," said [MASK]. "Why look at me, ma'am! I don't want a wife and family.
HardTimes	42	53294	53280	53322	Jem	To whom this honourable and jocular, member fraternally said one day, "[MASK], there's a good opening among the hard Fact fellows, and they want men. I wonder you don't go in for statistics."
HardTimes	50	53323	53312	53362	Jem	I wonder you don't go in for statistics." [MASK], rather taken by the novelty of the idea, and very hard up for a change, was as ready to "go in" for statistics as for anything else. So, he went in.
HardTimes	54	53699	53688	53742	Bounderby	"Don't be too sure of that," said [MASK]. "I don't promise it. First of all, you see our smoke. That's meat and drink to us. It's the healthiest thing in the world in all respects, and particularly for the lungs.
HardTimes	51	53842	53828	53879	Bounderby	On conviction." "I am glad to hear it," said [MASK]. "Now, you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills, no doubt. You have? Very good. I'll state the fact of it to you.
HardTimes	56	53954	53948	54004	Bounderby	" "Lastly," said [MASK], "as to our Hands. There's not a Hand in this town, sir, man, woman, or child, but has one ultimate object in life. That object is, to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon.
HardTimes	58	54222	54216	54274	Bounderby	"So now," said [MASK], "we may shake hands on equal terms. I say, equal terms, because although I know what I am, and the exact depth of the gutter I have lifted myself out of, better than any man does, I am as proud as you are.
HardTimes	50	55006	54957	55007	George	I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself, and I don't profess to understand the art of paying 'em. In fact, despise 'em. But, your bringing-up was different from mine; mine was a real thing, by [MASK]!
HardTimes	51	55211	55202	55253	Louisa	You have made up your mind," said [MASK], still standing before him where she had first stopped in all the singular contrariety of her self-possession, and her being obviously very ill at ease "to show the nation the way out of all its difficulties.
HardTimes	45	55635	55591	55636	Louisa	I am quite ready to go in for it, to the same extent as if I believed it. And what more could I possibly do, if I did believe it!" "You are a singular politician," said [MASK].
HardTimes	42	56647	56606	56648	Tom	It was altogether unaccountable that a young gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his cradle, should be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of grovelling sensualities; but such a monster, beyond all doubt, was [MASK].
HardTimes	49	57415	57386	57435	Tom	First person singular, I do not care; second person singular, thou dost not care; third person singular, she does not care," returned [MASK]. "Good! Very quaint!" said his friend. "Though you don't mean it.
HardTimes	44	57511	57510	57554	Tom	" [MASK] had by this time got both his legs on the sofa. If his second leg had not been already there when he was called a dear fellow, he would have put it up at that great stage of the conversation.
HardTimes	49	57931	57925	57974	Tom	" "Oh," returned [MASK], with contemptuous patronage, "she's a regular girl. A girl can get on anywhere. She has settled down to the life, and _she_ don't mind. It does just as well as another.
HardTimes	52	57978	57967	58019	Loo	It does just as well as another. Besides, though [MASK] is a girl, she's not a common sort of girl. She can shut herself up within herself, and think as I have often known her sit and watch the fire for an hour at a stretch.
HardTimes	46	58034	57992	58038	Harthouse	She can shut herself up within herself, and think as I have often known her sit and watch the fire for an hour at a stretch." "Ay, ay? Has resources of her own," said [MASK], smoking quietly.
HardTimes	50	58425	58411	58461	Tom	you have seen her already, have you?" His friend nodded. [MASK] took his cigar out of his mouth, to shut up his eye (which had grown rather unmanageable) with the greater expression, and to tap his nose several times with his finger.
HardTimes	50	58627	58578	58628	Tom	"I must take my leave of you though. I say. Yours is very good tobacco. But it's too mild." "Yes, it's too mild," returned his entertainer. "It's it's ridiculously mild," said [MASK].
HardTimes	49	59916	59875	59924	Slackbridge	" The assembly was divided at this point. There were some groans and hisses, but the general sense of honour was much too strong for the condemnation of a man unheard. "Be sure you're right, [MASK]!" "Put him up!"
HardTimes	52	59960	59932	59984	Slackbridge	Such things were said on many sides. Finally, one strong voice called out, "Is the man heer? If the man's heer, [MASK], let's hear the man himseln, 'stead o' yo." Which was received with a round of applause.
HardTimes	45	60045	60033	60078	Slackbridge	"Oh, my friends and fellow-men!" said [MASK] then, shaking his head with violent scorn, "I do not wonder that you, the prostrate sons of labour, are incredulous of the existence of such a man.
HardTimes	52	60279	60247	60299	Slackbridge	You know him awlung o' his misfort'ns, and his good name." With that, the chairman shook him frankly by the hand, and sat down again. [MASK] likewise sat down, wiping his hot forehead always from left to right, and never the reverse way.
HardTimes	49	60379	60378	60427	Slackbridge	" [MASK] shook his head as if he would shake it off, in his bitterness. "I'm th' one single Hand in Bounderby's mill, o' a' the men theer, as don't coom in wi' th' proposed reg'lations.
HardTimes	50	60455	60428	60478	Slackbridge	I canna coom in wi' 'em. My friends, I doubt their doin' yo onny good. Licker they'll do yo hurt." [MASK] laughed, folded his arms, and frowned sarcastically. "But 't an't sommuch for that as I stands out.
HardTimes	50	60519	60494	60544	Slackbridge	But I ha' my reasons mine, yo see for being hindered; not on'y now, but awlus awlus life long!" [MASK] jumped up and stood beside him, gnashing and tearing. "Oh, my friends, what but this did I tell you?
HardTimes	51	60696	60682	60733	Stephen	"'Tis this Delegate's trade for t' speak," said [MASK], "an' he's paid for 't, an' he knows his work. Let him keep to 't. Let him give no heed to what I ha had'n to bear.
HardTimes	47	60781	60748	60795	Slackbridge	" There was a propriety, not to say a dignity in these words, that made the hearers yet more quiet and attentive. The same strong voice called out, "[MASK], let the man be heern, and howd thee tongue!"
HardTimes	48	60809	60796	60844	Stephen	Then the place was wonderfully still. "My brothers," said [MASK], whose low voice was distinctly heard, "and my fellow-workmen for that yo are to me, though not, as I knows on, to this delegate here I ha
HardTimes	55	61005	60982	61037	Stephen	" There was an universal murmur to the same effect, though no man articulated a word. Every eye was fixed on [MASK]'s face. To repent of his determination, would be to take a load from all their minds. He looked around him, and knew that it was so.
HardTimes	55	61237	61229	61284	Slackbridge	I mean t' say," addressing [MASK], "but 'tis easier to ca' than mak' out. So let be." He had moved away a pace or two to come down from the platform, when he remembered something he had not said, and returned again.
HardTimes	42	61567	61566	61608	Slackbridge	Then [MASK], who had kept his oratorical arm extended during the going out, as if he were repressing with infinite solicitude and by a wonderful moral power the vehement passions of the multitude, applied himself to raising their spirits.
HardTimes	50	61739	61729	61779	Slackbridge	And consequently three cheers for the United Aggregate Tribunal! [MASK] acted as fugleman, and gave the time. The multitude of doubtful faces (a little conscience-stricken) brightened at the sound, and took it up. Private feeling must yield to the common cause.
HardTimes	59	62195	62147	62206	Blackpool	So, he had been quite alone during the four days, and had spoken to no one, when, as he was leaving his work at night, a young man of a very light complexion accosted him in the street. "Your name's [MASK], ain't it?" said the young man.
HardTimes	46	62618	62603	62649	Stephen	After the four days he had passed, this address fell rudely and discordantly on [MASK]'s ear. Besides being a rough handling of his wounded mind, it seemed to assume that he really was the self-interested deserter he had been called.
HardTimes	49	62940	62925	62974	Slackbridge	Quite different things. You had better tell us at once, that that fellow [MASK] is not in the town, stirring up the people to mutiny; and that he is not a regular qualified leader of the people: that is, a most confounded scoundrel.
HardTimes	53	63023	62975	63028	Stephen	You had better tell us so at once; you can't deceive me. You want to tell us so. Why don't you?" "I'm as sooary as yo, sir, when the people's leaders is bad," said [MASK], shaking his head.
HardTimes	52	63253	63202	63254	Bounderby	" "I'd leefer not coom to 't, sir; but sin you put th' question an' not want'n t' be ill-manner'n I'll answer. I ha passed a promess." "Not to me, you know," said [MASK].
HardTimes	53	63300	63255	63308	Bounderby	(Gusty weather with deceitful calms. One now prevailing.) "O no, sir. Not to yo." "As for me, any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do with it," said [MASK], still in confidence with the wall.
HardTimes	51	64754	64749	64800	Stephen	Mischeevous strangers!" said [MASK], with an anxious smile; "when ha we not heern, I am sure, sin ever we can call to mind, o' th' mischeevous strangers! 'Tis not by _them_ the trouble's made, sir.
HardTimes	43	65498	65473	65516	Stephen	And you go about, sowing it and raising crops. That's the business of _your_ life, my friend." [MASK] shook his head, mutely protesting that indeed he had other business to do for his life.
HardTimes	48	65601	65561	65609	Stephen	I never thought those fellows could be right in anything; but I tell you what! I so far go along with them for a novelty, that _I_'ll have nothing to do with you either." [MASK] raised his eyes quickly to his face.
HardTimes	50	65646	65636	65686	Stephen	" "Sir, yo know weel," said [MASK] expressively, "that if I canna get work wi' yo, I canna get it elsewheer." The reply was, "What I know, I know; and what you know, you know.
HardTimes	43	65827	65787	65830	Rachael	Nothing was further from his thoughts than the curious old woman he had encountered on his previous visit to the same house, when he heard a step behind him that he knew, and turning, saw her in [MASK]'s company.
HardTimes	41	65851	65851	65892	Missus	[MASK], thou wi' her!" "Well, and now you are surprised to be sure, and with reason I must say," the old woman returned. "Here I am again, you see.
HardTimes	52	66279	66263	66315	Rachael	With a gentleness that was as natural to him as he knew it to be to [MASK], he pursued the subject that interested her in her old age. "Well, missus," said he, "I ha seen the lady, and she were young and hansom.
HardTimes	51	66328	66293	66344	Rachael	"Well, missus," said he, "I ha seen the lady, and she were young and hansom. Wi' fine dark thinkin eyes, and a still way, [MASK], as I ha never seen the like on." "Young and handsome.
HardTimes	44	66382	66339	66383	Stephen	" "Young and handsome. Yes!" cried the old woman, quite delighted. "As bonny as a rose! And what a happy wife!" "Aye, missus, I suppose she be," said [MASK].
HardTimes	56	66470	66467	66523	Rachael	"Why, [MASK]," he replied, "whether I ha lef'n his work, or whether his work ha lef'n me, cooms t' th' same. His work and me are parted. 'Tis as weel so better, I were thinkin when yo coom up wi' me.
HardTimes	55	66543	66506	66561	monny	'Tis as weel so better, I were thinkin when yo coom up wi' me. It would ha brought'n trouble upon trouble if I had stayed theer. Haply 'tis a kindness to [MASK] that I go; haply 'tis a kindness to myseln; anyways it mun be done.
HardTimes	48	66629	66621	66669	Rachael	"But I'm not goin t'night, [MASK], nor yet t'morrow. 'Tan't easy overmuch t' know wheer t' turn, but a good heart will coom to me." Herein, too, the sense of even thinking unselfishly aided him.
HardTimes	50	66787	66774	66824	Rachael	So he said, with truth, "I'm more leetsome, [MASK], under 't, than I could'n ha believed." It was not her part to make his burden heavier. She answered with her comforting smile, and the three walked on together.
HardTimes	59	66874	66825	66884	Stephen	Age, especially when it strives to be self-reliant and cheerful, finds much consideration among the poor. The old woman was so decent and contented, and made so light of her infirmities, though they had increased upon her since her former interview with [MASK], that they both took an interest in her.
HardTimes	55	67028	67004	67059	Stephen	" They complied, and the three went on to the house where he lodged. When they turned into a narrow street, [MASK] glanced at his window with a dread that always haunted his desolate home; but it was open, as he had left it, and no one was there.
HardTimes	57	67275	67226	67283	Stephen	He too, with the world a wide heath before him, enjoyed the meal again in corroboration of the magnates, as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the part of these people, sir. "I ha never thowt yet, missus," said [MASK], "o' askin thy name.
HardTimes	52	67426	67413	67465	Stephen	"I'm sooary I ha spok'n on 't," said [MASK], "I ought t' hadn in my mind as I might touch a sore place. I I blame myseln." While he excused himself, the old lady's cup rattled more and more.
HardTimes	49	67550	67538	67587	Stephen	Then she said aloud, "I have lost him." [MASK] had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain, when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to the door, whispered in his ear.
HardTimes	49	67607	67606	67655	Bounderby	"[MASK]!" she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the table. "Oh hide me! Don't let me be seen for the world. Don't let him come up till I've got away. Pray, pray!"
HardTimes	51	67904	67897	67948	Louisa	For the first time in her life [MASK] had come into one of the dwellings of the Coketown Hands; for the first time in her life she was face to face with anything like individuality in connection with them. She knew of their existence by hundreds and by thousands.
HardTimes	54	68196	68160	68214	Stephen	She stood for some moments looking round the room. From the few chairs, the few books, the common prints, and the bed, she glanced to the two women, and to [MASK]. "I have come to speak to you, in consequence of what passed just now.
HardTimes	52	68236	68198	68250	Rachael	"I have come to speak to you, in consequence of what passed just now. I should like to be serviceable to you, if you will let me. Is this your wife?" [MASK] raised her eyes, and they sufficiently answered no, and dropped again.
HardTimes	57	68257	68251	68308	Louisa	"I remember," said [MASK], reddening at her mistake; "I recollect, now, to have heard your domestic misfortunes spoken of, though I was not attending to the particulars at the time. It was not my meaning to ask a question that would give pain to any one here.
HardTimes	52	68420	68369	68421	Rachael	Her manner was short and abrupt, yet faltering and timid. "He has told you what has passed between himself and my husband? You would be his first resource, I think." "I have heard the end of it, young lady," said [MASK].
HardTimes	55	68545	68496	68551	Rachael	" "Then, by the prejudices of his own class, and by the prejudices of the other, he is sacrificed alike? Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?" [MASK] shook her head in silence.
HardTimes	52	68560	68552	68604	Louisa	"He fell into suspicion," said [MASK], "with his fellow-weavers, because he had made a promise not to be one of them. I think it must have been to you that he made that promise. Might I ask you why he made it?
HardTimes	47	68606	68596	68643	Rachael	Might I ask you why he made it?" [MASK] burst into tears. "I didn't seek it of him, poor lad. I prayed him to avoid trouble for his own good, little thinking he'd come to it through me.
HardTimes	44	68670	68644	68688	Stephen	But I know he'd die a hundred deaths, ere ever he'd break his word. I know that of him well." [MASK] had remained quietly attentive, in his usual thoughtful attitude, with his hand at his chin.
HardTimes	53	68726	68701	68754	Rachael	"No one, excepting myseln, can ever know what honour, an' what love, an' respect, I bear to [MASK], or wi' what cause. When I passed that promess, I towd her true, she were th' Angel o' my life.
HardTimes	56	68772	68734	68790	Louisa	When I passed that promess, I towd her true, she were th' Angel o' my life. 'Twere a solemn promess. 'Tis gone fro' me, for ever." [MASK] turned her head to him, and bent it with a deference that was new in her.
HardTimes	49	68900	68882	68931	Louisa	" "How will you travel?" "Afoot, my kind ledy, afoot." [MASK] coloured, and a purse appeared in her hand. The rustling of a bank-note was audible, as she unfolded one and laid it on the table.
HardTimes	47	68933	68911	68958	Rachael	The rustling of a bank-note was audible, as she unfolded one and laid it on the table. "[MASK], will you tell him for you know how, without offence that this is freely his, to help him on his way?
HardTimes	57	69020	69019	69076	Louisa	" [MASK] looked, in part incredulous, in part frightened, in part overcome with quick sympathy, when this man of so much self-command, who had been so plain and steady through the late interview, lost his composure in a moment, and now stood with his hand before his face.
HardTimes	47	69266	69266	69313	Tom	[MASK] had sat upon the bed, swinging one leg and sucking his walking-stick with sufficient unconcern, until the visit had attained this stage. Seeing his sister ready to depart, he got up, rather hurriedly, and put in a word.
HardTimes	47	69320	69294	69341	Loo	Seeing his sister ready to depart, he got up, rather hurriedly, and put in a word. "Just wait a moment, [MASK]! Before we go, I should like to speak to him a moment. Something comes into my head.
HardTimes	43	69351	69322	69365	Blackpool	Before we go, I should like to speak to him a moment. Something comes into my head. If you'll step out on the stairs, [MASK], I'll mention it. Never mind a light, man!"
HardTimes	54	69464	69418	69472	Stephen	"I think I can do you a good turn. Don't ask me what it is, because it may not come to anything. But there's no harm in my trying." His breath fell like a flame of fire on [MASK]'s ear, it was so hot.
HardTimes	49	69791	69764	69813	Stephen	Now look here! You are sure you understand." He had wormed a finger, in the darkness, through a button-hole of [MASK]'s coat, and was screwing that corner of the garment tight up round and round, in an extraordinary manner.
HardTimes	48	69831	69824	69872	Tom	"Now look here!" repeated [MASK]. "Be sure you don't make any mistake then, and don't forget. I shall tell my sister as we go home, what I have in view, and she'll approve, I know.
HardTimes	56	70098	70087	70143	Rachael	They walked back together to the corner of the street where [MASK] lived, and as they drew nearer and nearer to it, silence crept upon them. When they came to the dark corner where their unfrequent meetings always ended, they stopped, still silent, as if both were afraid to speak.
HardTimes	49	70209	70191	70240	Rachael	" "Thou'rt awlus right. 'Tis bolder and better. I ha been thinkin then, [MASK], that as 'tis but a day or two that remains, 'twere better for thee, my dear, not t' be seen wi' me.
HardTimes	47	70261	70241	70288	Stephen	'T might bring thee into trouble, fur no good." "'Tis not for that, [MASK], that I mind. But thou know'st our old agreement. 'Tis for that." "Well, well," said he.
HardTimes	48	70310	70267	70315	Stephen	But thou know'st our old agreement. 'Tis for that." "Well, well," said he. "'Tis better, onnyways." "Thou'lt write to me, and tell me all that happens, [MASK]?" "Yes.
HardTimes	48	70347	70316	70364	Stephen	What can I say now, but Heaven be wi' thee, Heaven bless thee, Heaven thank thee and reward thee!" "May it bless thee, [MASK], too, in all thy wanderings, and send thee peace and rest at last!
HardTimes	48	70376	70365	70413	Stephen	" "I towd thee, my dear," said [MASK] Blackpool "that night that I would never see or think o' onnything that angered me, but thou, so much better than me, should'st be beside it. Thou'rt beside it now.
HardTimes	52	70569	70569	70621	Stephen	[MASK] worked the next day, and the next, uncheered by a word from any one, and shunned in all his comings and goings as before. At the end of the second day, he saw land; at the end of the third, his loom stood empty.
HardTimes	52	70756	70750	70802	Stephen	When he first came out, [MASK] thought he might be looking for him, and passed near; but the light porter only cast his winking eyes upon him slightly, and said nothing. Two hours were a long stretch of lounging about, after a long day's labour.
HardTimes	53	70803	70786	70839	Stephen	Two hours were a long stretch of lounging about, after a long day's labour. [MASK] sat upon the step of a door, leaned against a wall under an archway, strolled up and down, listened for the church clock, stopped and watched children playing in the street.
HardTimes	46	70868	70840	70886	Stephen	Some purpose or other is so natural to every one, that a mere loiterer always looks and feels remarkable. When the first hour was out, [MASK] even began to have an uncomfortable sensation upon him of being for the time a disreputable character.
HardTimes	46	71439	71402	71448	Stephen	So strange to have lived to his time of life, and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer morning! With these musings in his mind, and his bundle under his arm, [MASK] took his attentive face along the high road.
HardTimes	57	72527	72485	72542	Nickits	He delighted to live, barrack-fashion, among the elegant furniture, and he bullied the very pictures with his origin. "Why, sir," he would say to a visitor, "I am told that [MASK]," the late owner, "gave seven hundred pound for that Seabeach.
HardTimes	47	72589	72543	72590	George	Now, to be plain with you, if I ever, in the whole course of my life, take seven looks at it, at a hundred pound a look, it will be as much as I shall do. No, by [MASK]!
HardTimes	47	72736	72706	72753	Nickits	Bring half a dozen more if you like, and we'll find room for 'em. There's stabling in this place for a dozen horses; and unless [MASK] is belied, he kept the full number. A round dozen of 'em, sir.
HardTimes	50	73160	73153	73203	Tom	"Your brother. My young friend [MASK] " Her colour brightened, and she turned to him with a look of interest. "I never in my life," he thought, "saw anything so remarkable and so captivating as the lighting of those features!"
HardTimes	56	73240	73204	73260	Tom	His face betrayed his thoughts perhaps without betraying him, for it might have been according to its instructions so to do. "Pardon me. The expression of your sisterly interest is so beautiful [MASK] should be so proud of it I know this is inexcusable, but I am so compelled to admire.
HardTimes	55	73809	73807	73862	Tom	I think [MASK] may be gradually falling into trouble, and I wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience. Shall I say again, for his sake? Is that necessary?" She seemed to try to answer, but nothing came of it.
HardTimes	48	73940	73908	73956	Louisa	Whether forgive my plainness whether any great amount of confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his most worthy father." "I do not," said [MASK], flushing with her own great remembrance in that wise, "think it likely.
HardTimes	49	74733	74732	74781	Louisa	" [MASK] turned her eyes to his face, and asked him what fault was that? "Perhaps," he returned, "I have said enough. Perhaps it would have been better, on the whole, if no allusion to it had escaped me.
HardTimes	51	75302	75253	75304	Halloa	He was idly beating the branches as he lounged along: or he stooped viciously to rip the moss from the trees with his stick. He was startled when they came upon him while he was engaged in this latter pastime, and his colour changed. "[MASK]!"
HardTimes	41	75712	75680	75721	Louisa	However, never mind this now; it's not very interesting to you, and I am sick of the subject." They walked on to the house, where [MASK] quitted her visitor's arm and went in.
HardTimes	45	76016	75999	76044	Tom	After one exceedingly observant look at him, his companion relapsed into his lightest air. "[MASK], you are inconsiderate: you expect too much of your sister. You have had money of her, you dog, you know you have.
HardTimes	54	76813	76769	76823	Tom	And, my good fellow, if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you, I may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself." "Thank you," said [MASK], shaking his head dismally, and chewing rosebuds.
HardTimes	41	77097	77088	77129	Loo	"I didn't mean to be cross, [MASK]," he said, giving her his hand, and kissing her. "I know you are fond of me, and you know I am fond of you.
HardTimes	54	78024	77987	78041	Bounderby	But it might have been." "Of how much?" "Oh! as a sum if you stick to a sum of not more than a hundred and fifty pound," said [MASK], with impatience. "But it's not the sum; it's the fact.
HardTimes	52	78579	78574	78626	Bounderby	"Come!" retorted [MASK], stopping to wheel round upon him, "let's have none of _your_ interruptions. It's enough to be robbed while you're snoring because you're too comfortable, without being put right with _your_ four seven ones.
HardTimes	59	79118	79108	79167	Bounderby	"He has been helping the police," said [MASK], "and stays behind at the Bank. I wish these fellows had tried to rob me when I was at his time of life. They would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job; I can tell 'em that.
HardTimes	58	79236	79231	79289	Bounderby	"Well," said [MASK], stopping and facing about to confront them all, "I'll tell you. It's not to be mentioned everywhere; it's not to be mentioned anywhere: in order that the scoundrels concerned (there's a gang of 'em) may be thrown off their guard.
HardTimes	49	79388	79387	79436	Bounderby	said [MASK], immediately catching at the sound. "I know! I am used to that. I know all about it. They are the finest people in the world, these fellows are. They have got the gift of the gab, they have.
HardTimes	49	79805	79792	79841	Harthouse	Then, resumed his discourse. "You can recall for yourself, [MASK], what I said to him when you saw him. I didn't mince the matter with him. I am never mealy with 'em. I KNOW 'em. Very well, sir.
HardTimes	52	80212	80195	80247	Bounderby	"This is not all of 'em, even as we already know 'em," said [MASK], with many nods of hidden meaning. "But I have said enough for the present. You'll have the goodness to keep it quiet, and mention it to no one.
HardTimes	54	81753	81751	81805	Louisa	Long after [MASK] had undressed and lain down, she watched and waited for her brother's coming home. That could hardly be, she knew, until an hour past midnight; but in the country silence, which did anything but calm the trouble of her thoughts, time lagged wearily.
HardTimes	51	82001	81958	82009	Tom	She knew that he only feigned to be asleep, but she said nothing to him. He started by and by as if he were just then awakened, and asked who that was, and what was the matter? "[MASK], have you anything to tell me?
HardTimes	59	82214	82207	82266	Tom	In the name of that time, [MASK], tell me the truth now!" "What is it you want to know?" "You may be certain;" in the energy of her love she took him to her bosom as if he were a child; "that I will not reproach you.
HardTimes	53	82295	82267	82320	Tom	You may be certain that I will be compassionate and true to you. You may be certain that I will save you at whatever cost. O [MASK], have you nothing to tell me? Whisper very softly. Say only "yes," and I shall understand you!"
HardTimes	44	82340	82321	82365	Tom	She turned her ear to his lips, but he remained doggedly silent. "Not a word, [MASK]?" "How can I say Yes, or how can I say No, when I don't know what you mean?
HardTimes	55	82366	82366	82421	Loo	[MASK], you are a brave, kind girl, worthy I begin to think of a better brother than I am. But I have nothing more to say. Go to bed, go to bed." "You are tired," she whispered presently, more in her usual way.
HardTimes	55	82465	82463	82518	Tom	" "[MASK], have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people, and that we saw those three together?" "No. Didn't you yourself particularly ask me to keep it quiet when you asked me to go there with you?" "Yes.
HardTimes	48	82602	82592	82640	Loo	Must I say so?" "Good Heavens, [MASK]," returned her brother, "you are not in the habit of asking my advice. Say what you like. If you keep it to yourself, I shall keep it to _my_self.
HardTimes	53	82680	82653	82706	Tom	" It was too dark for either to see the other's face; but each seemed very attentive, and to consider before speaking. "[MASK], do you believe the man I gave the money to, is really implicated in this crime?" "I don't know.
HardTimes	50	82903	82874	82924	Loo	" "Was he offended by what you said?" "No, he took it pretty well; he was civil enough. Where are you, [MASK]?" He sat up in bed and kissed her. "Good night, my dear, good night.
HardTimes	48	82967	82939	82987	Tom	What should I have? You wouldn't have me tell you a lie!" "I wouldn't have you do that to-night, [MASK], of all the nights in your life; many and much happier as I hope they will be.
HardTimes	48	84596	84583	84631	Bounderby	"What has given you offence?" "Offence!" repeated [MASK]. "Do you suppose if there was any offence given me, I shouldn't name it, and request to have it corrected? I am a straightforward man, I believe.
HardTimes	52	84663	84643	84695	Louisa	" "I suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident, or too delicate," [MASK] answered him composedly: "I have never made that objection to you, either as a child or as a woman. I don't understand what you would have.
HardTimes	44	85672	85640	85684	Sissy	She went, with a heavy, hardened kind of sorrow upon her, into the house and into her mother's room. Since the time of her leaving home, [MASK] had lived with the rest of the family on equal terms.
HardTimes	50	86055	86006	86056	Louisa	" "I want to hear of you, mother; not of myself." "You want to hear of me, my dear? That's something new, I am sure, when anybody wants to hear of me. Not at all well, [MASK].
HardTimes	56	86372	86366	86422	Louisa	Left alone with her mother, [MASK] saw her lying with an awful lull upon her face, like one who was floating away upon some great water, all resistance over, content to be carried down the stream. She put the shadow of a hand to her lips again, and recalled her.
HardTimes	56	86582	86533	86589	Louisa	But, it was only by dint of bending down to her ear, and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they moved, that she could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of connexion. "You learnt a great deal, [MASK], and so did your brother.
HardTimes	47	86682	86636	86683	Louisa	" "I can hear you, mother, when you have strength to go on." This, to keep her from floating away. "But there is something not an Ology at all that your father has missed, or forgotten, [MASK].
HardTimes	45	88458	88442	88487	Louisa	" "I almost feel as though it must be bad in me," returned [MASK], after sitting thoughtful awhile, "to be so ready to agree with you, and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say.
HardTimes	48	89417	89384	89432	Bounderby	But you shall say no more, sir. I will go, upon your invitation." "Why, when I invite you to my house, ma'am," said [MASK], opening his eyes, "I should hope you want no other invitation.
HardTimes	56	89945	89924	89980	Tom	"I have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the station here," said [MASK], "and I am going to dine with him afterwards, I believe. He is not coming down to the country house for a week or so, being due somewhere else.
HardTimes	57	91303	91299	91356	Louisa	" "Where, [MASK]?" "Not here." "But we have so little time to make so much of, and I have come so far, and am altogether so devoted, and distracted. There never was a slave at once so devoted and ill-used by his mistress.
HardTimes	54	91410	91357	91411	Louisa	To look for your sunny welcome that has warmed me into life, and to be received in your frozen manner, is heart-rending." "Am I to say again, that I must be left to myself here?" "But we must meet, my dear [MASK].
HardTimes	44	92987	92967	93011	Louisa	He looked round the lamp upon his table, and saw, with amazement, his eldest daughter. "[MASK]!" "Father, I want to speak to you." "What is the matter? How strange you look!
HardTimes	57	93104	93055	93112	Louisa	Then she uncovered her head, and letting her cloak and hood fall where they might, stood looking at him: so colourless, so dishevelled, so defiant and despairing, that he was afraid of her. "What is it? I conjure you, [MASK], tell me what is the matter.
HardTimes	50	93146	93113	93163	Louisa	" She dropped into a chair before him, and put her cold hand on his arm. "Father, you have trained me from my cradle?" "Yes, [MASK]." "I curse the hour in which I was born to such a destiny.
HardTimes	48	93340	93293	93341	Louisa	I did not mean to say this; but, father, you remember the last time we conversed in this room?" He had been so wholly unprepared for what he heard now, that it was with difficulty he answered, "Yes, [MASK].
HardTimes	54	93964	93957	94011	Louisa	" "And you so young, [MASK]!" he said with pity. "And I so young. In this condition, father for I show you now, without fear or favour, the ordinary deadened state of my mind as I know it you proposed my husband to me.
HardTimes	51	94066	94016	94067	Tom	I never made a pretence to him or you that I loved him. I knew, and, father, you knew, and he knew, that I never did. I was not wholly indifferent, for I had a hope of being pleasant and useful to [MASK].
HardTimes	47	94088	94068	94115	Tom	I made that wild escape into something visionary, and have slowly found out how wild it was. But [MASK] had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my life; perhaps he became so because I knew so well how to pity him.
HardTimes	46	94241	94239	94285	Louisa	" "[MASK]!" he said, and said imploringly; for he well remembered what had passed between them in their former interview. "I do not reproach you, father, I make no complaint. I am here with another object.
HardTimes	51	94439	94434	94485	Louisa	" "For you, [MASK]!" Her father might instinctively have loosened his hold, but that he felt her strength departing from her, and saw a wild dilating fire in the eyes steadfastly regarding him. "I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence.
HardTimes	48	95023	95021	95069	Sissy	" "[MASK], I believe." "Why do you believe so?" "Because I found her here this morning. She didn't come to my bedside to wake me, as she always does; and I went to look for her.
HardTimes	49	95109	95070	95119	Sissy	She was not in her own room either; and I went looking for her all over the house, until I found her here taking care of you and cooling your head. Will you see father? [MASK] said I was to tell him when you woke.
HardTimes	53	95229	95184	95237	Louisa	"You can tell father if you will." Then, staying her for a moment, she said, "It was you who made my room so cheerful, and gave it this look of welcome?" "Oh no, [MASK], it was done before I came.
HardTimes	43	95241	95238	95281	Louisa	It was " [MASK] turned upon her pillow, and heard no more. When her sister had withdrawn, she turned her head back again, and lay with her face towards the door, until it opened and her father entered.
HardTimes	51	95368	95339	95390	Louisa	He spoke in a subdued and troubled voice, very different from his usual dictatorial manner; and was often at a loss for words. "My dear [MASK]. My poor daughter." He was so much at a loss at that place, that he stopped altogether.
HardTimes	52	95423	95395	95447	Louisa	"My unfortunate child." The place was so difficult to get over, that he tried again. "It would be hopeless for me, [MASK], to endeavour to tell you how overwhelmed I have been, and still am, by what broke upon me last night.
HardTimes	53	95559	95540	95593	Louisa	She had suffered the wreck of her whole life upon the rock. "I will not say, [MASK], that if you had by any happy chance undeceived me some time ago, it would have been better for us both; better for your peace, and better for mine.
HardTimes	41	96261	96239	96280	Louisa	If that other kind of wisdom should be what I have neglected, and should be the instinct that is wanted, [MASK] " He suggested it very doubtfully, as if he were half unwilling to admit it even now.
HardTimes	59	96445	96409	96468	Heaven	" "Father," she replied, without stirring, "if any harmony has been awakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to discord, let her thank [MASK] for it, and go upon her happier way, taking it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way.
HardTimes	47	96598	96576	96623	Louisa	Can it be so?" She made him no reply. "I am not too proud to believe it, [MASK]. How could I be arrogant, and you before me! Can it be so? Is it so, my dear?"
HardTimes	47	96962	96920	96967	Sissy	I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you?" "Why should you stay with me? My sister will miss you. You are everything to her." "Am I?" returned [MASK], shaking her head.
HardTimes	52	96986	96968	97020	Louisa	"I would be something to you, if I might." "What?" said [MASK], almost sternly. "Whatever you want most, if I could be that. At all events, I would like to try to be as near it as I can.
HardTimes	53	97058	97036	97089	Sissy	Will you let me?" "My father sent you to ask me." "No indeed," replied [MASK]. "He told me that I might come in now, but he sent me away from the room this morning or at least " She hesitated and stopped.
HardTimes	46	97098	97060	97106	Louisa	"He told me that I might come in now, but he sent me away from the room this morning or at least " She hesitated and stopped. "At least, what?" said [MASK], with her searching eyes upon her.
HardTimes	46	97488	97488	97534	Louisa	[MASK] raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join its fellow there. She fell upon her knees, and clinging to this stroller's child looked up at her almost with veneration. "Forgive me, pity me, help me!
HardTimes	48	97564	97525	97573	Sissy	"Forgive me, pity me, help me! Have compassion on my great need, and let me lay this head of mine upon a loving heart!" "O lay it here!" cried [MASK]. "Lay it here, my dear.
HardTimes	47	97918	97893	97940	Tom	Who could have been reduced to sudden extremity for the company of that griffin! "Well! I don't know," said [MASK], who had his own reasons for being uneasy about it. "She was off somewhere at daybreak this morning.
HardTimes	51	98050	98023	98074	Tom	Where was I too! Where were you, you mean." "I was prevented from coming detained." "Detained!" murmured [MASK]. "Two of us were detained. I was detained looking for you, till I lost every train but the mail.
HardTimes	59	99219	99212	99271	Sissy	" "I think," said [MASK], "you have already guessed whom I left just now!" "I have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four-and-twenty hours (which have appeared as many years)," he returned, "on a lady's account.
HardTimes	49	100365	100364	100413	Sissy	" [MASK]'s face sufficiently showed that her appeal to him was not finished. "You spoke," he resumed, as she raised her eyes to him again, "of your first object. I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned?
HardTimes	48	100866	100857	100905	Sissy	" "I am quite sure," repeated [MASK], "that it is the only reparation in your power, sir. I am quite sure, or I would not have come here." He glanced at her face, and walked about again.
HardTimes	50	101134	101107	101157	Sissy	_This_ will be, I suppose. I must take off myself, I imagine in short, I engage to do it." [MASK] rose. She was not surprised by the result, but she was happy in it, and her face beamed brightly.
HardTimes	47	102251	102238	102285	Bounderby	"If you can't get it out, ma'am," said [MASK], "leave _me_ to get it out. This is not a time for a lady, however highly connected, to be totally inaudible, and seemingly swallowing marbles.
HardTimes	48	102372	102358	102406	Bounderby	I know what passed." "You do? Perhaps," said [MASK], staring with all his might at his so quiet and assuasive father-in-law, "you know where your daughter is at the present time!" "Undoubtedly.
HardTimes	58	102473	102441	102499	Louisa	The moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak, and whom I deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you, [MASK] hurried here, for protection. I myself had not been at home many hours, when I received her here, in this room.
HardTimes	50	103049	103039	103089	Bounderby	"Now, you'll excuse me," said [MASK], "but I don't want to be too dear. That, to start with. When I begin to be dear to a man, I generally find that his intention is to come over me.
HardTimes	57	103224	103192	103249	Harthouse	But, I say we are all liable to mistakes and I should feel sensible of your delicacy, and grateful for it, if you would spare me these references to [MASK]. I shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement; pray do not persist in connecting him with mine.
HardTimes	53	103344	103307	103360	Louisa	" "Who do you mean by We?" "Let me say I, then," he returned, in answer to the coarsely blurted question; "I doubt whether I have understood [MASK]. I doubt whether I have been quite right in the manner of her education.
HardTimes	45	103370	103346	103391	Bounderby	I doubt whether I have been quite right in the manner of her education." "There you hit it," returned [MASK]. "There I agree with you. You have found it out at last, have you? Education!
HardTimes	45	103541	103505	103550	Bounderby	I assure you I have no desire to be controversial. I seek to repair what is amiss, if I possibly can; and I hope you will assist me in a good spirit, [MASK], for I have been very much distressed.
HardTimes	51	104538	104503	104554	Bounderby	who next to worship the ground I walk on." He discharged this like a Rocket, at his father-in-law's head. "Whereas your daughter," proceeded [MASK], "is far from being a born lady. That you know, yourself.
HardTimes	50	104633	104625	104675	Bounderby	" "Hear me out," said [MASK], "and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round. I say this, because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself, and to witness her insensibility.
HardTimes	41	104847	104828	104869	Louisa	"I mean that I hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner, for allowing [MASK] a period of repose and reflection here, which may tend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects.
HardTimes	55	105648	105620	105675	Venus	In boastful proof of his promptitude and activity, as a remarkable man, and a self-made man, and a commercial wonder more admirable than [MASK], who had risen out of the mud instead of the sea, he liked to show how little his domestic affairs abated his business ardour.
HardTimes	47	106820	106786	106833	Slackbridge	A few stern voices called out "No!" and a score or two hailed, with assenting cries of "Hear, hear!" the caution from one man, "[MASK], y'or over hetter in't; y'or a goen too fast!"
HardTimes	49	107314	107303	107352	Louisa	"I promised my sister I wouldn't." Which [MASK] hastily confirmed. "And besides," said the whelp bitterly, "she tells her own story so precious well and so full that what business had I to take it out of her mouth!
HardTimes	44	107568	107548	107592	Stephen	There have been a meeting to-night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way. [MASK]! The honestest lad, the truest lad, the best!" Her indignation failed her, and she broke off sobbing.
HardTimes	57	107616	107605	107662	Rachael	"Oh, young lady, young lady," returned [MASK], "I hope you may be, but I don't know! I can't say what you may ha' done! The like of you don't know us, don't care for us, don't belong to us.
HardTimes	47	107967	107944	107991	Rachael	You had better give your mind to that; not this." "'Deed, I am loath," returned [MASK], drying her eyes, "that any here should see me like this; but I won't be seen so again.
HardTimes	56	108662	108617	108673	Louisa	Must he go wrong all through wi' this side, or must he go wrong all through wi' that, or else be hunted like a hare?" "Indeed, indeed, I pity him from my heart," returned [MASK]; "and I hope that he will clear himself.
HardTimes	54	109025	109017	109071	Rachael	" "It goes against me," [MASK] answered, in a gentler manner, "to mistrust any one; but when I am so mistrusted when we all are I cannot keep such things quite out of my mind. I ask your pardon for having done you an injury.
HardTimes	51	109110	109081	109132	Sissy	Yet I might come to think it again, wi' the poor lad so wronged." "Did you tell him in your letter," inquired [MASK], "that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him, because he had been seen about the Bank at night?
HardTimes	52	109204	109183	109235	Sissy	It was never in his way. His way was the same as mine, and not near it." [MASK] had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and whether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of him.
HardTimes	50	109441	109413	109463	Louisa	Who is he?" His hair had latterly began to change its colour. As he leaned upon his hand again, looking gray and old, [MASK], with a face of fear and pity, hurriedly went over to him, and sat close at his side.
HardTimes	53	109614	109609	109662	Rachael	On the fourth day, [MASK], with unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to have miscarried, went up to the Bank, and showed her letter from him with his address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road, sixty miles away.
HardTimes	48	109946	109917	109965	Heaven	" Where was the man, and why did he not come back? In the dead of night the echoes of his own words, which had rolled [MASK] knows how far away in the daytime, came back instead, and abided by him until morning.
HardTimes	54	110019	110016	110070	Rachael	All day, [MASK] toiled as such people must toil, whatever their anxieties. The smoke-serpents were indifferent who was lost or found, who turned out bad or good; the melancholy mad elephants, like the Hard Fact men, abated nothing of their set routine, whatever happened.
HardTimes	42	110285	110250	110292	Sissy	But I get hope and strength through you; and you believe that though appearances may rise against him, he will be proved clear?" "I do believe so," returned [MASK], "with my whole heart.
HardTimes	48	110298	110293	110341	Rachael	I feel so certain, [MASK], that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement, is not like to be wrong, that I have no more doubt of him than if I had known him through as many years of trial as you have.
HardTimes	58	110590	110563	110621	Sissy	But I can't at all times keep out of my mind " Her voice so sunk into a low and slow communing with herself, that [MASK], sitting by her side, was obliged to listen with attention. "I can't at all times keep out of my mind, mistrustings of some one.
HardTimes	51	110650	110604	110655	Stephen	"I can't at all times keep out of my mind, mistrustings of some one. I can't think who 'tis, I can't think how or why it may be done, but I mistrust that some one has put [MASK] out of the way.
HardTimes	56	110708	110656	110712	Sissy	I mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord, and showing himself innocent before them all, some one would be confounded, who to prevent that has stopped him, and put him out of the way." "That is a dreadful thought," said [MASK], turning pale.
HardTimes	51	110857	110836	110887	Sissy	I'll walk home wi' you." "He might fall ill upon the journey back," said [MASK], faintly offering a worn-out scrap of hope; "and in such a case, there are many places on the road where he might stop.
HardTimes	55	110918	110912	110967	Sissy	" "True," was [MASK]'s reluctant admission. "He'd walk the journey in two days. If he was footsore and couldn't walk, I sent him, in the letter he got, the money to ride, lest he should have none of his own to spare.
HardTimes	50	110982	110933	110983	Rachael	If he was footsore and couldn't walk, I sent him, in the letter he got, the money to ride, lest he should have none of his own to spare." "Let us hope that to-morrow will bring something better, [MASK].
HardTimes	48	111065	111057	111105	Rachael	"You're not so hurried now, [MASK], and your hand is cooler." "I get better, dear, if I can only walk, and breathe a little fresh. 'Times when I can't, I turn weak and confused.
HardTimes	47	112169	112152	112199	Josiah	"My darling boy! I am not to blame. It's not my fault, [MASK]. I told this lady over and over again, that I knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you, but she would do it.
HardTimes	44	112238	112200	112244	Bounderby	" "What did you let her bring you for? Couldn't you knock her cap off, or her tooth out, or scratch her, or do something or other to her?" asked [MASK]. "My own boy!
HardTimes	48	112320	112293	112341	Josiah	Indeed, indeed, it is not my fault! My dear, noble, stately boy! I have always lived quiet, and secret, [MASK], my dear. I have never broken the condition once. I have never said I was your mother.
HardTimes	51	112585	112536	112587	Josiah	"Yes; dear in his self-made prosperity, madam, I dare say. Not very dear, however, when you deserted him in his infancy, and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother." "_I_ deserted my [MASK]!"
HardTimes	58	113457	113457	113515	Detected	[MASK] as the Bully of humility, who had built his windy reputation upon lies, and in his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if he had advanced the mean claim (there is no meaner) to tack himself on to a pedigree, he cut a most ridiculous figure.
HardTimes	52	114486	114458	114510	Rachael	They had seen no one, near or distant, for a long time; and the solitude remained unbroken. "It is so still here, [MASK], and the way is so untrodden, that I think we must be the first who have been here all the summer.
HardTimes	45	114513	114511	114556	Sissy	" As [MASK] said it, her eyes were attracted by another of those rotten fragments of fence upon the ground. She got up to look at it. "And yet I don't know. This has not been broken very long.
HardTimes	53	114573	114533	114586	Rachael	She got up to look at it. "And yet I don't know. This has not been broken very long. The wood is quite fresh where it gave way. Here are footsteps too. O [MASK]!" She ran back, and caught her round the neck.
HardTimes	45	114587	114575	114620	Rachael	" She ran back, and caught her round the neck. [MASK] had already started up. "What is the matter?" "I don't know. There is a hat lying in the grass." They went forward together.
HardTimes	51	114690	114664	114715	Sissy	He has been made away with. He is lying murdered here!" "Is there has the hat any blood upon it?" [MASK] faltered. They were afraid to look; but they did examine it, and found no mark of violence, inside or out.
HardTimes	54	114796	114779	114833	Rachael	" She had unclasped her hand, and was in the act of stepping forward, when [MASK] caught her in both arms with a scream that resounded over the wide landscape. Before them, at their very feet, was the brink of a black ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass.
HardTimes	49	114886	114854	114903	Rachael	"O, my good Lord! He's down there! Down there!" At first this, and her terrific screams, were all that could be got from [MASK], by any tears, by any prayers, by any representations, by any means.
HardTimes	51	115186	115185	115236	Rachael	"[MASK], we must lose not a moment. We must go in different directions, seeking aid. You shall go by the way we have come, and I will go forward by the path. Tell any one you see, and every one what has happened.
HardTimes	54	115831	115795	115849	Rachael	After they had waited some time, straggling people who had heard of the accident began to come up; then the real help of implements began to arrive. In the midst of this, [MASK] returned; and with her party there was a surgeon, who brought some wine and medicines.
HardTimes	47	116872	116845	116892	Stephen	The Old Hell Shaft, the pitman said, with a curse upon it, was worthy of its bad name to the last; for though [MASK] could speak now, he believed it would soon be found to have mangled the life out of him.
HardTimes	57	117278	117261	117318	Rachael	Though he lay quite motionless looking up at the sky, he smiled and said, "[MASK]." She stooped down on the grass at his side, and bent over him until her eyes were between his and the sky, for he could not so much as turn them to look at her.
HardTimes	49	117320	117281	117330	Rachael	She stooped down on the grass at his side, and bent over him until her eyes were between his and the sky, for he could not so much as turn them to look at her. "[MASK], my dear." She took his hand.
HardTimes	56	117355	117331	117387	Stephen	He smiled again and said, "Don't let 't go." "Thou'rt in great pain, my own dear [MASK]?" "I ha' been, but not now. I ha' been dreadful, and dree, and long, my dear but 'tis ower now.
HardTimes	52	117390	117368	117420	Rachael	I ha' been dreadful, and dree, and long, my dear but 'tis ower now. Ah, [MASK], aw a muddle! Fro' first to last, a muddle!" The spectre of his old look seemed to pass as he said the word.
HardTimes	53	117634	117611	117664	Rachael	" He faintly said it, without any anger against any one. Merely as the truth. "Thy little sister, [MASK], thou hast not forgot her. Thou'rt not like to forget her now, and me so nigh her. Thou know'st poor, patient, suff'rin, dear
HardTimes	54	117724	117719	117773	Louisa	Aw a muddle!" [MASK] approached him; but he could not see her, lying with his face turned up to the night sky. "If aw th' things that tooches us, my dear, was not so muddled, I should'n ha' had'n need to coom heer.
HardTimes	50	117841	117810	117860	Rachael	right if he'd ever know'd me at aw he would'n ha' took'n offence wi' me. He would'n ha' suspect'n me. But look up yonder, [MASK]! Look aboove!" Following his eyes, she saw that he was gazing at a star.
HardTimes	57	117916	117903	117960	Rachael	I ha' look'n at 't and thowt o' thee, [MASK], till the muddle in my mind have cleared awa, above a bit, I hope. If soom ha' been wantin' in unnerstan'in me better, I, too, ha' been wantin' in unnerstan'in them better.
HardTimes	51	118173	118142	118193	Stephen	"You ha' heard?" he said, after a few moments' silence. "I ha' not forgot you, ledy." "Yes, [MASK], I have heard you. And your prayer is mine." "You ha' a father.
HardTimes	49	118211	118180	118229	Louisa	And your prayer is mine." "You ha' a father. Will yo tak' a message to him?" "He is here," said [MASK], with dread. "Shall I bring him to you?" "If yo please.
HardTimes	54	118231	118216	118270	Louisa	"Shall I bring him to you?" "If yo please." [MASK] returned with her father. Standing hand-in-hand, they both looked down upon the solemn countenance. "Sir, yo will clear me an' mak my name good wi' aw men.
HardTimes	59	118411	118359	118418	Rachael	The bearers being now ready to carry him away, and the surgeon being anxious for his removal, those who had torches or lanterns, prepared to go in front of the litter. Before it was raised, and while they were arranging how to go, he said to [MASK], looking upward at the star:
HardTimes	52	118495	118454	118506	Rachael	I awmust think it be the very star!" They lifted him up, and he was overjoyed to find that they were about to take him in the direction whither the star seemed to him to lead. "[MASK], beloved lass! Don't let go my hand.
HardTimes	48	118529	118500	118548	Stephen	Don't let go my hand. We may walk toogether t'night, my dear!" "I will hold thy hand, and keep beside thee, [MASK], all the way." "Bless thee! Will soombody be pleased to coover my face!
HardTimes	50	118570	118535	118585	Rachael	" "Bless thee! Will soombody be pleased to coover my face!" They carried him very gently along the fields, and down the lanes, and over the wide landscape; [MASK] always holding the hand in hers. Very few whispers broke the mournful silence.
HardTimes	50	119176	119141	119191	Louisa	Before he left the room, he appointed a time for them to come to him; and so, with his gray head drooping, went away. "Dear father," said [MASK], when they kept their appointment, "you have three young children left.
HardTimes	47	119599	119558	119605	Sissy	In the few hours that I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the truth, how is he to be found by us, and only by us? Ten thousand pounds could not effect it." "[MASK] has effected it, father.
HardTimes	59	120403	120365	120424	Sleary	Though they took but a hasty breakfast, and no rest (which it would have been in vain to seek under such anxious circumstances), it was noon before they began to find the bills of [MASK]'s Horse-riding on barns and walls, and one o'clock when they stopped in the market-place.
HardTimes	58	120459	120425	120483	Sissy	A Grand Morning Performance by the Riders, commencing at that very hour, was in course of announcement by the bellman as they set their feet upon the stones of the street. [MASK] recommended that, to avoid making inquiries and attracting attention in the town, they should present themselves to pay at the door.
HardTimes	55	121644	121643	121698	Thethilia	Now [MASK] hath kithd all the children, and hugged all the women, and thaken handth all round with all the men, clear, every one of you, and ring in the band for the thecond part!" As soon as they were gone, he continued in a low tone.
HardTimes	46	121702	121685	121731	Thethilia	As soon as they were gone, he continued in a low tone. "Now, [MASK], I don't athk to know any thecreth, but I thuppothe I may conthider thith to be Mith Thquire." "This is his sister.
HardTimes	49	121772	121732	121781	Louisa	Yes." "And t'other on'th daughter. That'h what I mean. Hope I thee you well, mith. And I hope the Thquire'th well?" "My father will be here soon," said [MASK], anxious to bring him to the point.
HardTimes	46	121816	121795	121841	Thethilia	he replied. "I want you jutht to take a peep at the Ring, mith, through here. [MASK], you know the dodgeth; find a thpy-hole for yourthelf." They each looked through a chink in the boards.
HardTimes	52	121967	121959	122011	Sleary	"Look at 'em again," said [MASK], "look at 'em well. You thee em all? Very good. Now, mith;" he put a form for them to sit on; "I have my opinionth, and the Thquire your father hath hith.
HardTimes	48	122043	122012	122060	Thethilia	I don't want to know what your brother'th been up to; ith better for me not to know. All I thay ith, the Thquire hath thtood by [MASK], and I'll thtand by the Thquire. Your brother ith one them black thervanth.

HardTimes	47	123319	123314	123361	Sleary	"Now," said [MASK], "come along to the coath, and jump up behind; I'll go with you there, and they'll thuppothe you one of my people. Thay farewell to your family, and tharp'th the word."
HardTimes	53	123593	123545	123598	Sleary	Coming out with every word about our having gone to that place, when you saw the net was gathering round me. Pretty love that! You have regularly given me up. You never cared for me." "Tharp'th the word!" said [MASK], at the door.
HardTimes	53	123605	123599	123652	Louisa	They all confusedly went out: [MASK] crying to him that she forgave him, and loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her so, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one ran against them.
HardTimes	51	123680	123676	123727	Bitzer	For, there was [MASK], out of breath, his thin lips parted, his thin nostrils distended, his white eyelashes quivering, his colourless face more colourless than ever, as if he ran himself into a white heat, when other people ran themselves into a glow.
HardTimes	49	124307	124294	124343	Bitzer	"I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir," returned [MASK]; "but I am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self-interest. What you must always appeal to, is a person's self-interest.
HardTimes	41	124726	124718	124759	Bitzer	"I don't deny," added [MASK], "that my schooling was cheap. But that comes right, sir. I was made in the cheapest market, and have to dispose of myself in the dearest.
HardTimes	45	125113	125111	125156	Sissy	But, [MASK] glanced at him with great attention; nor did she in her own breast misunderstand him. As they were all going out again, he favoured her with one slight roll of his movable eye, desiring her to linger behind.
HardTimes	56	125242	125210	125266	Childerth	It'll be a dark night; I've got a horthe that'll do anything but thpeak; I've got a pony that'll go fifteen mile an hour with [MASK] driving of him; I've got a dog that'll keep a man to one plathe four-and-twenty hourth.
HardTimes	54	125477	125456	125510	Bitzer	Soon after dark they all three got in and started; the learned dog (a formidable creature) already pinning [MASK] with his eye, and sticking close to the wheel on his side, that he might be ready for him in the event of his showing the slightest disposition to alight.
HardTimes	54	125568	125568	125622	Childerth	[MASK] took him off, an hour and a half after we left there latht night. The horthe danthed the polka till he wath dead beat (he would have walthed if he hadn't been in harneth), and then I gave him the word and he went to thleep comfortable.
HardTimes	48	125880	125860	125908	Thquire	Though he thought them far too slight, he said, for such a service. "Very well, [MASK]; then, if you'll only give a Horthe-riding, a bethpeak, whenever you can, you'll more than balanthe the account.
HardTimes	42	127545	127533	127575	Bounderby	" "You had better allow me, ma'am," said [MASK], passing her, and getting his hand upon the lock; "because I can take the opportunity of saying a word to you, before you go.
HardTimes	49	128485	128452	128501	Charity	Did he see himself, a white-haired decrepit man, bending his hitherto inflexible theories to appointed circumstances; making his facts and figures subservient to Faith, Hope, and [MASK]; and no longer trying to grind that Heavenly trio in his dusty little mills?
HardTimes	46	128602	128595	128641	Louisa	* * * * * Here was [MASK] on the night of the same day, watching the fire as in days of yore, though with a gentler and a humbler face. How much of the future might arise before _her_ vision?
HardTimes	58	128885	128884	128942	Louisa	Did [MASK] see this? Such a thing was to be. A lonely brother, many thousands of miles away, writing, on paper blotted with tears, that her words had too soon come true, and that all the treasures in the world would be cheaply bartered for a sight of her dear face?
