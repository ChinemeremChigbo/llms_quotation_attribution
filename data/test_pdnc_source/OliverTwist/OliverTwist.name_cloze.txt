OliverTwist	41	376	367	408	Oliver	Now, if, during this brief period, [MASK] had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time.
OliverTwist	50	2141	2130	2180	Oliver	But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in [MASK]'s breast. It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all.
OliverTwist	49	3258	3236	3285	Bumble	Notwithstanding the most superlative, and, I may say, supernat'ral exertions on the part of this parish," said [MASK], "we have never been able to discover who is his father, or what was his mother's settlement, name, or condition.
OliverTwist	51	3483	3470	3521	Oliver	He finished the gin-and-water, and added, "[MASK] being now too old to remain here, the board have determined to have him back into the house. I have come out myself to take him there. So let me see him at once.
OliverTwist	42	3542	3542	3584	Oliver	[MASK], having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed off in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress.
OliverTwist	41	4276	4236	4277	Bumble	At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face. "Bow to the board," said [MASK].
OliverTwist	43	4278	4278	4321	Oliver	[MASK] brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table, fortunately bowed to that. "What's your name, boy?" said the gentleman in the high chair.
OliverTwist	46	4322	4305	4351	Oliver	"What's your name, boy?" said the gentleman in the high chair. [MASK] was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him cry.
OliverTwist	44	4435	4414	4458	Oliver	You know you're an orphan, I suppose?" "What's that, sir?" inquired poor [MASK]. "The boy _is_ a fool I thought he was," said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
OliverTwist	49	4504	4459	4508	Oliver	"Hush!" said the gentleman who had spoken first. "You know you've got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don't you?" "Yes, sir," replied [MASK], weeping bitterly.
OliverTwist	52	4619	4582	4634	Oliver	" "Yes, sir," stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right. It would have been very like a Christian, and a marvellously good Christian too, if [MASK] had prayed for the people who fed and took care of _him_.
OliverTwist	50	4717	4701	4751	Oliver	For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum, [MASK] bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he sobbed himself to sleep.
OliverTwist	52	5705	5705	5757	Child	[MASK] as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery. He rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity: "Please, sir, I want some more.
OliverTwist	41	5830	5796	5837	Oliver	The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear. "What!" said the master at length, in a faint voice. "Please, sir," replied [MASK], "I want some more.
OliverTwist	50	5978	5969	6019	Bumble	" "He did, sir," replied [MASK]. "That boy will be hung," said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. "I know that boy will be hung." Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman's opinion. An animated discussion took place.
OliverTwist	43	6525	6501	6544	Oliver	Let it not be supposed by the enemies of "the system," that, during the period of his solitary incarceration, [MASK] was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation.
OliverTwist	44	7948	7928	7972	Gamfield	"Ten shillings too much," said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. "Come!" said [MASK]; "say four pound, gen'l'men. Say four pound, and you've got rid of him for good and all.
OliverTwist	52	8036	8024	8076	Gamfield	"You're desperate hard upon me, gen'l'men," said [MASK], wavering. "Pooh! pooh! nonsense!" said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. "He'd be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you silly fellow!
OliverTwist	44	8265	8260	8304	Oliver	At this tremendous sight, [MASK] began to cry very piteously: thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way.
OliverTwist	58	8388	8374	8432	Oliver	"The kind and blessed gentleman which is so many parents to you, [MASK], when you have none of your own: are a going to "prentice" you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of you: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!
OliverTwist	41	8550	8525	8566	Oliver	Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don't cry into your gruel; that's a very foolish action, [MASK]." It certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already.
OliverTwist	47	9049	9048	9095	Oliver	" [MASK] roused himself, and made his best obeisance. He had been wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates' powder, whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account.
OliverTwist	46	9193	9148	9194	Bumble	"And he _will_ be a sweep, will he?" inquired the old gentleman. "If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he'd run away simultaneous, your worship," replied [MASK].
OliverTwist	51	9290	9253	9304	Oliver	"You're a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest, open-hearted man," said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for [MASK]'s premium, whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty.
OliverTwist	43	9387	9347	9390	Oliver	"I have no doubt you are, my friend," replied the old gentleman: fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the inkstand. It was the critical moment of [MASK]'s fate.
OliverTwist	52	9594	9563	9615	Beadle	"My boy!" said the old gentleman, "you look pale and alarmed. What is the matter?" "Stand a little away from him, [MASK]," said the other magistrate: laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of interest.
OliverTwist	45	9634	9633	9678	Oliver	" [MASK] fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that they would order him back to the dark room that they would starve him beat him kill him if they pleased rather than send him away with that dreadful man.
OliverTwist	56	9949	9909	9965	Oliver	"Take the boy back to the workhouse, and treat him kindly. He seems to want it." That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that [MASK] would be hung, but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain.
OliverTwist	51	10266	10226	10277	Oliver	The more the case presented itself to the board, in this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for [MASK] effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.
OliverTwist	48	11943	11937	11985	Oliver	The simple fact was, that [MASK], instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received.
OliverTwist	54	12236	12218	12272	Oliver	"Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir." Although [MASK] did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor.
OliverTwist	53	13160	13149	13202	Oliver	I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which [MASK] tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine. There is only one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish.
OliverTwist	55	13334	13290	13345	Oliver	You don't mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn't much matter whether you do or don't, for you can't sleep anywhere else. Come; don't keep me here all night!" [MASK] lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress.
OliverTwist	53	13643	13634	13687	Oliver	Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed [MASK]. He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him.
OliverTwist	45	13784	13784	13829	Oliver	[MASK] was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times.
OliverTwist	44	13881	13847	13891	Oliver	"Open the door, will yer?" cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door. "I will, directly, sir," replied [MASK]: undoing the chain, and turning the key.
OliverTwist	41	13921	13892	13933	Oliver	"I suppose yer the new boy, ain't yer?" said the voice through the key-hole. "Yes, sir," replied [MASK]. "How old are yer?" inquired the voice.
OliverTwist	55	13941	13934	13989	Oliver	"Ten, sir," replied [MASK]. "Then I'll whop yer when I get in," said the voice; "you just see if I don't, that's all, my work'us brat!" and having made this obliging promise, the voice began to whistle.
OliverTwist	44	13990	13990	14034	Oliver	[MASK] had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably.
OliverTwist	47	14644	14636	14683	Noah	" "Let him alone!" said [MASK]. "Why everybody lets him alone enough, for the matter of that. Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty well.
OliverTwist	45	14686	14646	14691	Charlotte	"Why everybody lets him alone enough, for the matter of that. Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty well. Eh, [MASK]? He! he!
OliverTwist	49	14951	14916	14965	Oliver	It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy. [MASK] had been sojourning at the undertaker's some three weeks or a month.
OliverTwist	50	16729	16725	16775	Oliver	He stepped in; [MASK] followed him. There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically, over the empty stove. An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth, and was sitting beside him.
OliverTwist	56	16808	16808	16864	Oliver	[MASK] shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the boy felt that it was a corpse. The man's face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly; his eyes were bloodshot.
OliverTwist	49	16891	16891	16940	Oliver	[MASK] was afraid to look at either her or the man. They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside. "Nobody shall go near her," said the man, starting fiercely up, as the undertaker approached the recess. "Keep back!
OliverTwist	58	17607	17555	17613	Oliver	she said eagerly: catching at the undertaker's coat, as he once more moved towards the door. "Yes, yes," said the undertaker, "of course. Anything you like!" He disengaged himself from the old woman's grasp; and, drawing [MASK] after him, hurried away.
OliverTwist	41	17736	17720	17761	Sowerberry	"Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!" whispered [MASK] in the old woman's ear; "we are rather late; and it won't do, to keep the clergyman waiting.
OliverTwist	59	18606	18605	18664	Oliver	As [MASK] accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded people bear their trials and losses.
OliverTwist	44	19060	19049	19093	Oliver	And now, I come to a very important passage in [MASK]'s history; for I have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance, but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings.
OliverTwist	50	19558	19534	19584	Noah	_Your_ mother, too! She was a nice 'un she was. Oh, Lor!" And here, [MASK] nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the occasion.
OliverTwist	57	19918	19862	19919	Noah	His breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an energy he had never known before. "He'll murder me!" blubbered [MASK].
OliverTwist	48	20190	20163	20211	Oliver	This was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged [MASK], struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and there locked him up.
OliverTwist	51	20480	20451	20502	Oliver	"Your master's not at home; there's not a man in the house, and he'll kick that door down in ten minutes." [MASK]'s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question, rendered this occurance highly probable. "Dear, dear!
OliverTwist	57	20607	20606	20663	Noah	" [MASK] stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed; and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his head, and a clasp-knife at his eye.
OliverTwist	42	21232	21229	21271	Jove	" "By [MASK]!" exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short. "I knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first, that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!
OliverTwist	48	21344	21328	21376	Noah	"No! he's out, or he would have murdered him," replied [MASK]. "He said he wanted to." "Ah! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?" inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
OliverTwist	47	21440	21417	21464	Noah	" "Certainly, my boy; certainly," said the gentleman in the white waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting [MASK]'s head, which was about three inches higher than his own. "You're a good boy a very good boy.
OliverTwist	43	22225	22225	22268	Oliver	[MASK]'s offence having been explained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.
OliverTwist	44	22703	22681	22725	Oliver	It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that [MASK] gave way to the feelings which the day's treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child.
OliverTwist	49	22837	22832	22881	Oliver	For a long time, [MASK] remained motionless in this attitude. The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.
OliverTwist	47	22999	22984	23031	Oliver	With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters, [MASK] arose, and again unbarred the door. One timid look around one moment's pause of hesitation he had closed it behind him, and was in the open street.
OliverTwist	51	23221	23208	23259	Oliver	There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour. [MASK] stopped, and peeped into the garden. A child was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions.
OliverTwist	45	23260	23260	23305	Oliver	[MASK] felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself, he had been his little friend and playmate. They had been beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time.
OliverTwist	55	23380	23372	23427	Dick	They beat and ill-use me, [MASK]; and I am going to seek my fortune, some long way off. I don't know where. How pale you are!" "I heard the doctor tell them I was dying," replied the child with a faint smile.
OliverTwist	41	23476	23469	23510	Dick	"I shall see you again, [MASK]. I know I shall! You will be well and happy!" "I hope so," replied the child. "After I am dead, but not before.
OliverTwist	50	23596	23580	23630	Oliver	The blessing was from a young child's lips, but it was the first that [MASK] had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once forgot it. CHAPTER VIII.
OliverTwist	47	23980	23951	23998	Sowerberry	He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in his bundle. He had a penny too a gift of [MASK]'s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well in his pocket.
OliverTwist	48	24006	23999	24047	Oliver	"A clean shirt," thought [MASK], "is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles' walk in winter time."
OliverTwist	48	24506	24476	24524	Oliver	In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail. This frightened [MASK] very much, and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition.
OliverTwist	47	24627	24600	24647	Oliver	but they threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about the beadle which brought [MASK]'s heart into his mouth, very often the only thing he had there, for many hours together.
OliverTwist	51	24914	24908	24959	Oliver	Some few stopped to gaze at [MASK] for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat.
OliverTwist	46	25401	25356	25402	Oliver	He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the bluchers. "Hullo, my covey! What's the row?" said this strange young gentleman to [MASK].
OliverTwist	50	25413	25403	25453	Oliver	"I am very hungry and tired," replied [MASK]: the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke. "I have walked a long way. I have been walking these seven days." "Walking for sivin days!" said the young gentleman.
OliverTwist	52	25586	25535	25587	Oliver	"Why, a beak's a madgst'rate; and when you walk by a beak's order, it's not straight forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin. Was you never on the mill?" "What mill?" inquired [MASK].
OliverTwist	54	25842	25824	25878	Oliver	Here, a pot of beer was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and [MASK], falling to, at his new friend's bidding, made a long and hearty meal, during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention.
OliverTwist	45	26000	25956	26001	Oliver	"Yes. I do, when I'm at home," replied the boy. "I suppose you want some place to sleep in to-night, don't you?" "I do, indeed," answered [MASK].
OliverTwist	43	26166	26133	26176	Oliver	This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted; especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide [MASK] with a comfortable place, without loss of time.
OliverTwist	46	26474	26473	26519	Oliver	Although [MASK] had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way, as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen.
OliverTwist	46	26914	26914	26960	Oliver	[MASK], groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them.
OliverTwist	57	27214	27158	27215	Oliver	Seated round the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men. These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at [MASK].
OliverTwist	51	27408	27365	27416	Oliver	These civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the Jew's toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them. "We are very glad to see you, [MASK], very," said the Jew.
OliverTwist	51	27481	27435	27486	Oliver	Ah, you're a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear. There are a good many of 'em, ain't there? We've just looked 'em out, ready for the wash; that's all, [MASK]; that's all.
OliverTwist	46	27528	27518	27564	Oliver	In the midst of which they went to supper. [MASK] ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because another gentleman wanted the tumbler.
OliverTwist	49	27706	27669	27718	Oliver	He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before. Although [MASK] had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly awake.
OliverTwist	52	27821	27775	27827	Oliver	At such time, a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate. [MASK] was precisely in this condition.
OliverTwist	50	27930	27900	27950	Oliver	Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at [MASK], and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all appearances asleep.
OliverTwist	48	27979	27951	27999	Oliver	After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to [MASK], from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on the table.
OliverTwist	58	28067	28013	28071	Staunch	Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels. "Aha!" said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every feature with a hideous grin. "Clever dogs! Clever dogs! [MASK] to the last!
OliverTwist	53	28192	28148	28201	Oliver	At least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly workmanship, that [MASK] had no idea, even of their names.
OliverTwist	51	28457	28444	28495	Oliver	He trembled very much though; for, even in his terror, [MASK] could see that the knife quivered in the air. "What's that?" said the Jew. "What do you watch me for? Why are you awake? What have you seen?
OliverTwist	48	28523	28478	28526	Oliver	"What do you watch me for? Why are you awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick quick! for your life." "I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir," replied [MASK], meekly.
OliverTwist	44	28570	28527	28571	Oliver	"I am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir." "You were not awake an hour ago?" said the Jew, scowling fiercely on the boy. "No! No, indeed!" replied [MASK].
OliverTwist	53	28704	28671	28724	Oliver	"Of course I know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You're a brave boy. Ha! ha! you're a brave boy, [MASK]." The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.
OliverTwist	48	28760	28725	28773	Oliver	"Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?" said the Jew, laying his hand upon it after a short pause. "Yes, sir," replied [MASK]. "Ah!" said the Jew, turning rather pale.
OliverTwist	53	28780	28762	28815	Oliver	"Ah!" said the Jew, turning rather pale. "They they're mine, [MASK]; my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that's all.
OliverTwist	50	28930	28898	28948	Oliver	There's a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here; and I'll give you a basin to wash in, my dear." [MASK] got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher.
OliverTwist	42	29064	29053	29095	Oliver	"Well," said the Jew, glancing slyly at [MASK], and addressing himself to the Dodger, "I hope you've been at work this morning, my dears?" "Hard," replied the Dodger.
OliverTwist	42	29566	29539	29581	Oliver	This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there; and [MASK] naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious.
OliverTwist	54	29788	29743	29797	Oliver	At such times, he would look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn't lost anything, in such a very funny and natural manner, that [MASK] laughed till the tears ran down his face.
OliverTwist	51	30030	29994	30045	Oliver	They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. Being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, [MASK] thought them very nice girls indeed. As there is no doubt they were.
OliverTwist	55	30189	30178	30233	Oliver	" "Have they done work, sir?" inquired [MASK]. "Yes," said the Jew; "that is, unless they should unexpectedly come across any, when they are out; and they won't neglect it, if they do, my dear, depend upon it.
OliverTwist	50	30334	30285	30335	Oliver	He'll be a great man himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him. Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?" said the Jew, stopping short. "Yes, sir," said [MASK].
OliverTwist	43	30365	30364	30407	Oliver	" [MASK] held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other. "Is it gone?" cried the Jew.
OliverTwist	57	30443	30425	30482	Oliver	"You're a clever boy, my dear," said the playful old gentleman, patting [MASK] on the head approvingly. "I never saw a sharper lad. Here's a shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you'll be the greatest man of the time.
OliverTwist	44	30504	30483	30527	Oliver	And now come here, and I'll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs." [MASK] wondered what picking the old gentleman's pocket in play, had to do with his chances of being a great man.
OliverTwist	56	30565	30528	30584	OLIVER	But, thinking that the Jew, being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study. CHAPTER X. [MASK] BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE.
OliverTwist	50	30805	30764	30814	Oliver	On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent. At length, one morning, [MASK] obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought.
OliverTwist	41	30961	30942	30983	Oliver	The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter, that [MASK] soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all.
OliverTwist	52	31069	31062	31114	Oliver	These things looked so bad, that [MASK] was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.
OliverTwist	51	31221	31189	31240	Oliver	"Hush!" replied the Dodger. "Do you see that old cove at the book-stall?" "The old gentleman over the way?" said [MASK]. "Yes, I see him." "He'll do," said the Dodger.
OliverTwist	47	31252	31252	31299	Oliver	[MASK] looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed.
OliverTwist	43	31300	31300	31343	Oliver	[MASK] walked a few paces after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement. The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a powdered head and gold spectacles.
OliverTwist	49	31502	31500	31549	Oliver	What was [MASK]'s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman's pocket, and draw from thence a handkerchief!
OliverTwist	57	31685	31680	31737	Oliver	In the very instant when [MASK] began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator; and shouting "Stop thief!"
OliverTwist	45	31809	31800	31845	Oliver	They no sooner heard the cry, and saw [MASK] running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting "Stop thief!" too, joined in the pursuit like good citizens.
OliverTwist	52	31847	31836	31888	Oliver	too, joined in the pursuit like good citizens. Although [MASK] had been brought up by philosophers, he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps he would have been prepared for this.
OliverTwist	49	32355	32351	32400	Oliver	"Yes." [MASK] lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth, looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers.
OliverTwist	50	32619	32585	32635	Oliver	"Come, get up," said the man, roughly. "It wasn't me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys," said [MASK], clasping his hands passionately, and looking round. "They are here somewhere.
OliverTwist	47	32753	32741	32788	Oliver	Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?" [MASK], who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at a rapid pace.
OliverTwist	49	32822	32789	32838	Oliver	The gentleman walked on with them by the officer's side; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead, and stared back at [MASK] from time to time. The boys shouted in triumph; and on they went.
OliverTwist	49	32998	32972	33021	Oliver	"What's the matter now?" said the man carelessly. "A young fogle-hunter," replied the man who had [MASK] in charge. "Are you the party that's been robbed, sir?" inquired the man with the keys.
OliverTwist	46	33095	33084	33130	Oliver	Now, young gallows!" This was an invitation for [MASK] to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell. Here he was searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.
OliverTwist	47	33262	33243	33290	Oliver	Let any one who doubts this, compare the two. The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as [MASK] when the key grated in the lock. He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance.
OliverTwist	52	33636	33625	33677	Oliver	But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which [MASK]'s features bore a trace. So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman, buried them again in the pages of the musty book.
OliverTwist	57	34072	34045	34102	Brownlow	" "My name, sir," said the old gentleman, speaking _like_ a gentleman, "my name, sir, is [MASK]. Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person, under the protection of the bench."
OliverTwist	49	34346	34312	34361	Fang	"You're an insolent impertinent fellow. How dare you bully a magistrate!" "What!" exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening. "Swear this person!" said [MASK] to the clerk. "I'll not hear another word. Swear him.
OliverTwist	52	34492	34458	34510	Oliver	Here, swear this policeman. Now, policeman, what is this?" The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the charge; how he had searched [MASK], and found nothing on his person; and how that was all he knew about it.
OliverTwist	48	34820	34796	34844	Oliver	"Come, none of your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won't do. What's your name?" [MASK] tried to reply but his tongue failed him. He was deadly pale; and the whole place seemed turning round and round.
OliverTwist	47	34893	34890	34937	Oliver	He bent over [MASK], and repeated the inquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess.
OliverTwist	51	35051	35022	35073	Oliver	"He says they died in his infancy, your worship," replied the officer: hazarding the usual reply. At this point of the inquiry, [MASK] raised his head; and, looking round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water.
OliverTwist	43	35156	35122	35165	Fang	"Take care of him, officer," said the old gentleman, raising his hands instinctively; "he'll fall down." "Stand away, officer," cried [MASK]; "let him, if he likes.
OliverTwist	51	35211	35185	35236	Fang	The men in the office looked at each other, but no one dared to stir. "I knew he was shamming," said [MASK], as if this were incontestable proof of the fact. "Let him lie there; he'll soon be tired of that.
OliverTwist	47	35717	35675	35722	Fang	Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery. "Why didn't you come here before?" said [MASK], after a pause.
OliverTwist	49	35783	35739	35788	Fang	"Everybody who could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit. I could get nobody till five minutes ago; and I've run here all the way." "The prosecutor was reading, was he?" inquired [MASK], after another pause.
OliverTwist	53	35818	35789	35842	Fang	"Yes," replied the man. "The very book he has in his hand." "Oh, that book, eh?" said [MASK]. "Is it paid for?" "No, it is not," replied the man, with a smile.
OliverTwist	43	35877	35843	35886	Fang	"Dear me, I forgot all about it!" exclaimed the absent old gentleman, innocently. "A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!" said [MASK], with a comical effort to look humane.
OliverTwist	46	36131	36122	36168	Oliver	Directly!" A coach was obtained, and [MASK] having been carefully laid on the seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other. "May I accompany you?" said the book-stall keeper, looking in.
OliverTwist	52	36235	36194	36246	OLIVER	I have this unhappy book still! Jump in. Poor fellow! There's no time to lose." The book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove. CHAPTER XII. IN WHICH [MASK] IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE.
OliverTwist	57	36367	36361	36418	Oliver	But, for many days, [MASK] remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends. The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.
OliverTwist	49	36502	36466	36515	Oliver	Feebly raising himself in the bed, with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around. "What room is this? Where have I been brought to?" said [MASK]. "This is not the place I went to sleep in.
OliverTwist	55	36652	36642	36697	Oliver	With those words, the old lady very gently placed [MASK]'s head upon the pillow; and, smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers, and drawing it round his neck.
OliverTwist	53	36757	36726	36779	Oliver	What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!" "Perhaps she does see me," whispered [MASK], folding his hands together; "perhaps she has sat by me. I almost feel as if she had.
OliverTwist	53	36805	36780	36833	Oliver	" "That was the fever, my dear," said the old lady mildly. "I suppose it was," replied [MASK], "because heaven is a long way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy.
OliverTwist	49	36872	36861	36910	Oliver	She can't know anything about me though," added [MASK] after a moment's silence. "If she had seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.
OliverTwist	41	36985	36983	37024	Oliver	So, [MASK] kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said.
OliverTwist	50	37245	37221	37271	Oliver	"You feel sleepy, don't you, my dear?" said the doctor. "No, sir," replied [MASK]. "No," said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. "You're not sleepy. Nor thirsty.
OliverTwist	53	37402	37367	37420	Oliver	The doctor, after tasting the cool stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away: his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs. [MASK] dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly twelve o'clock.
OliverTwist	49	37560	37552	37601	Oliver	And thus the night crept slowly on. [MASK] lay awake for some time, counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall.
OliverTwist	54	37927	37874	37928	Oliver	"Never mind me, my dear," said the old lady; "I'm only having a regular good cry. There; it's all over now; and I'm quite comfortable." "You're very, very kind to me, ma'am," said [MASK].
OliverTwist	54	38031	38004	38058	Oliver	And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough, [MASK] thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation.
OliverTwist	53	38225	38173	38226	Oliver	The man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed; it's a deal too honest. A deal," said the old lady, laughing very heartily at her own acuteness. "Is is that a likeness, ma'am?" said [MASK].
OliverTwist	51	38259	38251	38302	Oliver	" "Whose, ma'am?" asked [MASK]. "Why, really, my dear, I don't know," answered the old lady in a good-humoured manner. "It's not a likeness of anybody that you or I know, I expect.
OliverTwist	53	38321	38303	38356	Oliver	It seems to strike your fancy, dear." "It is so pretty," replied [MASK]. "Why, sure you're not afraid of it?" said the old lady: observing in great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting.
OliverTwist	51	38421	38419	38470	Lord	" "[MASK] save us!" exclaimed the old lady, starting; "don't talk in that way, child. You're weak and nervous after your illness. Let me wheel your chair round to the other side; and then you won't see it.
OliverTwist	58	38663	38618	38676	Oliver	Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at [MASK], than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions.
OliverTwist	49	39313	39291	39340	Oliver	The expression was, for the instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy! [MASK] knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away.
OliverTwist	42	40044	40010	40052	Charley	"Hold your noise," remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round. "Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?" "I can't help it," said [MASK], "I can't help it!
OliverTwist	51	40152	40127	40178	Fagin	As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than before. "What'll [MASK] say?" inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question.
OliverTwist	51	40263	40255	40306	Charley	"What do you mean?" said [MASK]. "Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn't, and high cockolorum," said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance. This was explanatory, but not satisfactory.
OliverTwist	47	41046	41000	41047	Fagin	I might have know'd, as nobody but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to throw away any drink but water and not that, unless he done the River Company every quarter. Wot's it all about, [MASK]?
OliverTwist	48	42320	42296	42344	Oliver	It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom [MASK] had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh. "The very thing!" said the Jew.
OliverTwist	49	42346	42335	42384	Bet	"The very thing!" said the Jew. "[MASK] will go; won't you, my dear?" "Wheres?" inquired the young lady. "Only just up to the office, my dear," said the Jew coaxingly.
OliverTwist	49	42960	42947	42996	Nancy	My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!" exclaimed [MASK], bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket and the street-door key in an agony of distress. "What has become of him! Where have they taken him to!
OliverTwist	49	43381	43354	43403	Nancy	He made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the county: so [MASK] passed on to the next cell, and knocked there. "Well!" cried a faint and feeble voice.
OliverTwist	52	43603	43580	43632	Nancy	"I haven't got him, my dear," said the old man. "Where is he?" screamed [MASK], in a distracted manner. "Why, the gentleman's got him," replied the officer. "What gentleman! Oh, gracious heavens!
OliverTwist	51	43877	43877	43928	Nancy	[MASK], my dear, I must have him found. I trust to you, my dear, to you and the Artful for everything! Stay, stay," added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; "there's money, my dears.
OliverTwist	53	43999	43947	44000	Oliver	Don't stop here a minute. Not an instant, my dears!" With these words, he pushed them from the room: and carefully double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to [MASK].
OliverTwist	52	44078	44033	44085	Nancy	he cried in a shrill tone. "Me!" replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole. "What now?" cried the Jew impatiently. "Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, [MASK] says?" inquired the Dodger.
OliverTwist	49	44772	44765	44814	Oliver	They were happy days, those of [MASK]'s recovery. Everything was so quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it seemed like Heaven itself.
OliverTwist	46	44857	44856	44902	Oliver	As [MASK] was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself.
OliverTwist	52	45553	45522	45574	Oliver	How should you like to grow up a clever man, and write books, eh?" "I think I would rather read them, sir," replied [MASK]. "What! wouldn't you like to be a book-writer?" said the old gentleman.
OliverTwist	45	45575	45575	45620	Oliver	[MASK] considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing.
OliverTwist	43	45696	45654	45697	Oliver	"Don't be afraid! We won't make an author of you, while there's an honest trade to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to." "Thank you, sir," said [MASK].
OliverTwist	49	45838	45817	45866	Oliver	" "Oh, don't tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!" exclaimed [MASK], alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman's commencement! "Don't turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again.
OliverTwist	47	45916	45890	45937	Oliver	Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!" "My dear child," said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of [MASK]'s sudden appeal; "you need not be afraid of my deserting you, unless you give me cause.
OliverTwist	44	46113	46073	46117	Oliver	Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them." As the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to his companion: and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: [MASK] sat quite still.
OliverTwist	55	47244	47207	47262	Oliver	Then, still keeping his stick in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of [MASK]: who, seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.
OliverTwist	51	48611	48595	48646	Oliver	"The books are on a chair by my table. Fetch them down." [MASK], delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to take.
OliverTwist	48	48725	48712	48760	Oliver	" "I won't be ten minutes, sir," said [MASK], eagerly. Having buttoned up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room.
OliverTwist	50	48863	48825	48875	Oliver	"Bless his sweet face!" said the old lady, looking after him. "I can't bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight." At this moment, [MASK] looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned the corner.
OliverTwist	50	49616	49607	49657	Sikes	"You would, would you?" said [MASK], seizing the poker in one hand, and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew from his pocket. "Come here, you born devil! Come here! D'ye hear?
OliverTwist	43	50007	49983	50026	Fagin	"Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go! I wish you had been the dog, [MASK], half a minute ago." "Why?" inquired the Jew with a forced smile.
OliverTwist	53	50064	50027	50080	Sikes	"Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as haven't half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes," replied [MASK], shutting up the knife with a very expressive look; "that's why.
OliverTwist	50	50122	50106	50156	Sikes	He was obviously very ill at ease, however. "Grin away," said [MASK], replacing the poker, and surveying him with savage contempt; "grin away. You'll never have the laugh at me, though, unless it's behind a nightcap.
OliverTwist	53	50166	50139	50192	Fagin	You'll never have the laugh at me, though, unless it's behind a nightcap. I've got the upper hand over you, [MASK]; and, d me, I'll keep it. There! If I go, you go; so take care of me.
OliverTwist	47	50220	50178	50225	Bill	There! If I go, you go; so take care of me." "Well, well, my dear," said the Jew, "I know all that; we we have a mutual interest, [MASK], a mutual interest.
OliverTwist	51	50401	50369	50420	Sikes	As he spoke, he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet. [MASK], snatching it from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained.
OliverTwist	49	50463	50441	50490	Sikes	"You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?" inquired [MASK], suspiciously. "Don't put on an injured look at the question; you've done it many a time. Jerk the tinkler.
OliverTwist	59	50516	50467	50526	Fagin	"Don't put on an injured look at the question; you've done it many a time. Jerk the tinkler." These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell. It was answered by another Jew: younger than [MASK], but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance.
OliverTwist	58	50555	50536	50594	Fagin	The Jew, perfectly understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a remarkable look with [MASK], who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person.
OliverTwist	47	50599	50595	50642	Sikes	It was lost upon [MASK], who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot-lace which the dog had torn. Possibly, if he had observed the brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no good to him.
OliverTwist	41	50783	50743	50784	Barney	"Where? Strike me blind, if I don't honour that 'ere girl, for her native talents." "She's bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar," replied [MASK].
OliverTwist	49	51394	51358	51407	Oliver	And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck. "Don't," cried [MASK], struggling. "Let go of me. Who is it?
OliverTwist	59	51473	51415	51474	Oliver	" The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a street-door key in her hand. "Oh my gracious!" said the young woman, "I have found him! Oh! [MASK]!
OliverTwist	41	51475	51475	51516	Oliver	[MASK]! Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your account! Come home, dear, come. Oh, I've found him. Thank gracious goodness heavins, I've found him!"
OliverTwist	53	51627	51583	51636	Oliver	To which, the butcher's boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to say indolent disposition: replied, that he thought not. "Oh, no, no, never mind," said the young woman, grasping [MASK]'s hand; "I'm better now.
OliverTwist	55	51734	51702	51757	Oliver	" "Young wretch!" said one woman. "Go home, do, you little brute," said the other. "I am not," replied [MASK], greatly alarmed. "I don't know her. I haven't any sister, or father and mother either.
OliverTwist	50	51932	51911	51961	Oliver	" "I don't belong to them. I don't know them. Help! help!" cried [MASK], struggling in the man's powerful grasp. "Help!" repeated the man. "Yes; I'll help you, you young rascal!
OliverTwist	48	52090	52065	52113	Oliver	said the two women. "And he shall have it, too!" rejoined the man, administering another blow, and seizing [MASK] by the collar. "Come on, you young villain! Here, Bull's-eye, mind him, boy!
OliverTwist	47	52558	52543	52590	Oliver	D'ye mind!" The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed [MASK] as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay. "He's as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn't!"
OliverTwist	45	52592	52591	52636	Sikes	said [MASK], regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval. "Now, you know what you've got to expect, master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game.
OliverTwist	53	52742	52702	52755	Oliver	The night was dark and foggy. The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in [MASK]'s eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing.
OliverTwist	51	53190	53168	53219	Oliver	" The girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and they walked away. But [MASK] felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in her face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly white.
OliverTwist	47	53487	53478	53525	Oliver	"No," replied a voice, which [MASK] thought he had heard before. "Is the old 'un here?" asked the robber. "Yes," replied the voice, "and precious down in the mouth he has been.
OliverTwist	51	53558	53526	53577	Oliver	Won't he be glad to see you? Oh, no!" The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it, seemed familiar to [MASK]'s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness.
OliverTwist	52	53587	53578	53630	Sikes	"Let's have a glim," said [MASK], "or we shall go breaking our necks, or treading on the dog. Look after your legs if you do!" "Stand still a moment, and I'll get you one," replied the voice.
OliverTwist	54	53692	53660	53714	Oliver	He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick. The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon [MASK] than a humourous grin; but, turning away, beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs.
OliverTwist	47	53886	53867	53914	Oliver	Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to [MASK], viewed him round and round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy.
OliverTwist	49	53958	53957	54006	Charley	said [MASK], putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. "Look at his togs! Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game! And his books, too!
OliverTwist	50	54012	54007	54057	Fagin	Nothing but a gentleman, [MASK]!" "Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear," said the Jew, bowing with mock humility. "The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday one.
OliverTwist	49	54312	54309	54358	Nancy	Do you think [MASK] and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as gets grabbed through you? Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton, give it here!"
OliverTwist	42	54412	54400	54442	Sikes	"That's for our share of the trouble," said [MASK]; "and not half enough, neither. You may keep the books, if you're fond of reading. If you ain't, sell 'em.
OliverTwist	45	54532	54522	54567	Oliver	"They belong to the old gentleman," said [MASK], wringing his hands; "to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever.
OliverTwist	49	54655	54626	54675	Oliver	Oh, do have mercy upon me, and send them back!" With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief, [MASK] fell upon his knees at the Jew's feet; and beat his hands together, in perfect desperation.
OliverTwist	48	54705	54700	54748	Oliver	"You're right, [MASK], you're right; they _will_ think you have stolen 'em. Ha! ha!" chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands, "it couldn't have happened better, if we had chosen our time!
OliverTwist	44	54911	54910	54954	Nancy	cried [MASK], springing before the door, and closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit. "Keep back the dog; he'll tear the boy to pieces." "Serve him right!"
OliverTwist	49	54956	54934	54983	Sikes	"Keep back the dog; he'll tear the boy to pieces." "Serve him right!" cried [MASK], struggling to disengage himself from the girl's grasp. "Stand off from me, or I'll split your head against the wall.
OliverTwist	46	54993	54984	55030	Bill	" "I don't care for that, [MASK], I don't care for that," screamed the girl, struggling violently with the man, "the child shan't be torn down by the dog, unless you kill me first.
OliverTwist	44	55086	55045	55089	Oliver	"I'll soon do that, if you don't keep off." The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging [MASK] among them.
OliverTwist	47	55184	55152	55199	Nancy	" "Then keep quiet, will you?" said the Jew, with a threatening look. "No, I won't do that, neither," replied [MASK], speaking very loud. "Come! What do you think of that?
OliverTwist	55	55298	55259	55314	Oliver	"So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?" said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace; "eh?" [MASK] made no reply. But he watched the Jew's motions, and breathed quickly.
OliverTwist	47	55361	55341	55388	Oliver	"We'll cure you of that, my young master." The Jew inflicted a smart blow on [MASK]'s shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand.
OliverTwist	54	55423	55389	55443	Fagin	She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room. "I won't stand by and see it done, [MASK]," cried the girl. "You've got the boy, and what more would you have?
OliverTwist	54	55613	55578	55632	Fagin	my dear, you are acting beautifully." "Am I!" said the girl. "Take care I don't overdo it. You will be the worse for it, [MASK], if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me.
OliverTwist	59	56011	56002	56061	Sikes	"You're a nice one," added [MASK], as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air, "to take up the humane and gen teel side! A pretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!" "God Almighty help me, I am!"
OliverTwist	49	56236	56217	56266	Oliver	I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this!" pointing to [MASK]. "I have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years since. Don't you know it? Speak out!
OliverTwist	52	56539	56512	56564	Sikes	" The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over; but neither he, nor [MASK], nor the dog, nor the boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business.
OliverTwist	46	60343	60308	60354	Oliver	It would be tedious if given in the beadle's words: occupying, as it did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of it was, that [MASK] was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents.
OliverTwist	43	61716	61711	61754	Oliver	From all of these tokens [MASK] concluded that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and dreary as it looked now.
OliverTwist	57	61951	61929	61986	Oliver	There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter; and out of this, [MASK] often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends.
OliverTwist	48	62164	62164	62212	Oliver	[MASK] was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal.
OliverTwist	56	62734	62679	62735	Charley	"He wouldn't so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without wittles for a fortnight," said the Dodger. "Not a bit of it," observed [MASK].
OliverTwist	52	62814	62763	62815	Charley	pursued the Dodger. "Won't he growl at all, when he hears a fiddle playing! And don't he hate other dogs as ain't of his breed! Oh, no!" "He's an out-and-out Christian," said [MASK].
OliverTwist	47	63067	63067	63114	Oliver	[MASK] knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his boot-cleaning. "Go!" exclaimed the Dodger. "Why, where's your spirit?
OliverTwist	49	63206	63173	63222	Oliver	" "_I_ couldn't do it," said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust. "You can leave your friends, though," said [MASK] with a half smile; "and let them be punished for what you did.
OliverTwist	49	63917	63897	63946	Oliver	" "To be sure, to be sure!" said the Jew, who had entered unseen by [MASK]. "It all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the Dodger's word for it. Ha! ha! ha!
OliverTwist	49	64404	64385	64434	Fagin	"He's in luck, then," said the young man, with a meaning look at [MASK]. "Never mind where I came from, young 'un; you'll find your way there, soon enough, I'll bet a crown!"
OliverTwist	57	64459	64406	64463	Fagin	"Never mind where I came from, young 'un; you'll find your way there, soon enough, I'll bet a crown!" At this sally, the boys laughed. After some more jokes on the same subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with [MASK]; and withdrew.
OliverTwist	52	64662	64630	64682	Oliver	At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days: mixed up with so much that was droll and curious, that [MASK] could not help laughing heartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings.
OliverTwist	42	65178	65150	65192	Bill	A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man's voice demanded who was there. "Only me, [MASK]; only me, my dear," said the Jew looking in.
OliverTwist	57	65394	65358	65415	Fagin	All doubts upon the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady's behaviour. She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade [MASK] draw up his, without saying more about it: for it was a cold night, and no mistake.
OliverTwist	41	65421	65416	65457	Nancy	"It is cold, [MASK] dear," said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire. "It seems to go right through one," added the old man, touching his side.
OliverTwist	45	65486	65479	65524	Nancy	"Give him something to drink, [MASK]. Burn my body, make haste! It's enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.
OliverTwist	44	65583	65575	65619	Bill	"Quite enough, quite, thankye, [MASK]," replied the Jew, putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it. "What! You're afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?"
OliverTwist	49	65967	65959	66008	Bill	Wot d'ye mean?" "Hush, [MASK], hush!" said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation; "somebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody will hear us." "Let 'em hear!"
OliverTwist	53	66131	66089	66142	Sikes	When is it to be done? Such plate, my dear, such plate!" said the Jew: rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation. "Not at all," replied [MASK] coldly. "Not to be done at all!"
OliverTwist	48	66162	66153	66201	Sikes	"No, not at all," rejoined [MASK]. "At least it can't be a put-up job, as we expected." "Then it hasn't been properly gone about," said the Jew, turning pale with anger.
OliverTwist	49	66218	66181	66230	Sikes	" "Then it hasn't been properly gone about," said the Jew, turning pale with anger. "Don't tell me!" "But I will tell you," retorted [MASK]. "Who are you that's not to be told?
OliverTwist	52	66479	66450	66502	Sikes	" "He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my dear," said the Jew. "So he did," rejoined [MASK], "and they warn't of no more use than the other plant." The Jew looked blank at this information.
OliverTwist	57	66717	66695	66752	Sikes	" "Yes," said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself. "Is it a bargain?" inquired [MASK]. "Yes, my dear, yes," rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened.
OliverTwist	46	66782	66782	66828	Toby	[MASK] and me were over the garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and shutters. The crib's barred up at night like a jail; but there's one part we can crack, safe and softly.
OliverTwist	41	66884	66879	66920	Sikes	"Umph!" cried [MASK], stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew's face. "Never mind which part it is.
OliverTwist	46	67041	66996	67042	Sikes	The first we've both got; the second you must find us." "A boy!" exclaimed the Jew. "Oh! then it's a panel, eh?" "Never mind wot it is!" replied [MASK].
OliverTwist	46	67413	67399	67445	Fagin	"Why, you don't mind the old girl, do you, [MASK]?" he asked at length. "You've known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil's in it. She ain't one to blab.
OliverTwist	58	67448	67421	67479	Nancy	"You've known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil's in it. She ain't one to blab. Are you [MASK]?" "_I_ should think not!" replied the young lady: drawing her chair up to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.
OliverTwist	42	67697	67664	67706	Oliver	you're a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!" said the Jew, patting her on the neck. "It _was_ about [MASK] I was going to speak, sure enough.
OliverTwist	49	67721	67707	67756	Sikes	Ha! ha! ha!" "What about him?" demanded [MASK]. "He's the boy for you, my dear," replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper; laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.
OliverTwist	54	67827	67774	67828	Bill	"I would, if I was in your place. He mayn't be so much up, as any of the others; but that's not what you want, if he's only to open a door for you. Depend upon it he's a safe one, [MASK].
OliverTwist	43	67838	67829	67872	Fagin	" "I know he is," rejoined [MASK]. "He's been in good training these last few weeks, and it's time he began to work for his bread. Besides, the others are all too big.
OliverTwist	53	67933	67917	67970	Sikes	That is, if you frighten him enough." "Frighten him!" echoed [MASK]. "It'll be no sham frightening, mind you. If there's anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in for a penny, in for a pound.
OliverTwist	54	67979	67935	67989	Fagin	"It'll be no sham frightening, mind you. If there's anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in for a penny, in for a pound. You won't see him alive again, [MASK]. Think of that, before you send him.
OliverTwist	50	68122	68079	68129	Sikes	Oho! It couldn't have come about better!" The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy. "Ours!" said [MASK]. "Yours, you mean.
OliverTwist	48	68535	68519	68567	Sikes	"And about " "Oh, ah, it's all planned," rejoined [MASK], interrupting him. "Never mind particulars. You'd better bring the boy here to-morrow night. I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak.
OliverTwist	43	68906	68901	68944	Nancy	"Good-night, [MASK]," said the Jew, muffling himself up as before. "Good-night." Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly. There was no flinching about the girl.
OliverTwist	44	69099	69097	69141	Oliver	"Is [MASK] a-bed? I want to speak to him," was his first remark as they descended the stairs. "Hours ago," replied the Dodger, throwing open a door. "Here he is!"
OliverTwist	47	69430	69398	69445	Oliver	"No, no, my dear. Not to stop there," replied the Jew. "We shouldn't like to lose you. Don't be afraid, [MASK], you shall come back to us again. Ha! ha! ha!
OliverTwist	51	69488	69461	69512	Oliver	Oh no, no!" The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread, looked round as he bantered [MASK] thus; and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could.
OliverTwist	51	69767	69719	69770	Oliver	"You may burn a candle," said the Jew, putting one upon the table. "And here's a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you. Good-night!" "Good-night!" replied [MASK], softly.
OliverTwist	45	69799	69771	69816	Oliver	The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went. Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name. [MASK] looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to light it.
OliverTwist	48	69860	69817	69865	Oliver	He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table, saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and contracted brows, from the dark end of the room. "Take heed, [MASK]! take heed!"
OliverTwist	53	69949	69949	70002	Oliver	[MASK] leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard. The more he thought of the Jew's admonition, the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning.
OliverTwist	48	70586	70551	70599	Oliver	he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure standing by the door. "Who's there?" "Me. Only me," replied a tremulous voice. [MASK] raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door.
OliverTwist	52	70627	70620	70672	Oliver	"It hurts my eyes." [MASK] saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill. The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him: and wrung her hands; but made no reply. "God forgive me!"
OliverTwist	49	70694	70686	70735	Oliver	" "Has anything happened?" asked [MASK]. "Can I help you? I will if I can. I will, indeed." She rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a gurgling sound, gasped for breath.
OliverTwist	48	70905	70890	70938	Oliver	"You are to go with me." "What for?" asked [MASK], recoiling. "What for?" echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again, the moment they encountered the boy's face. "Oh!
OliverTwist	51	70953	70909	70960	Oliver	"What for?" echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again, the moment they encountered the boy's face. "Oh! For no harm." "I don't believe it," said [MASK]: who had watched her closely.
OliverTwist	55	70985	70961	71016	Oliver	"Have it your own way," rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. "For no good, then." [MASK] could see that he had some power over the girl's better feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state.
OliverTwist	54	71201	71156	71210	Oliver	I have tried hard for you, but all to no purpose. You are hedged round and round. If ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time." Struck by the energy of her manner, [MASK] looked up in her face with great surprise.
OliverTwist	49	71441	71412	71461	Oliver	Hush! Every word from you is a blow for me. Give me your hand. Make haste! Your hand!" She caught the hand which [MASK] instinctively placed in hers, and, blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs.
OliverTwist	54	71507	71489	71543	Oliver	A hackney-cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing [MASK], the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close. The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed, without the delay of an instant.
OliverTwist	47	71548	71523	71570	Oliver	The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed, without the delay of an instant. The girl still held [MASK] fast by the hand, and continued to pour into his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted.
OliverTwist	55	71621	71616	71671	Oliver	For one brief moment, [MASK] cast a hurried glance along the empty street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips. But the girl's voice was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that he had not the heart to utter it.
OliverTwist	42	72645	72645	72687	Oliver	[MASK] stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.
OliverTwist	48	72759	72733	72781	Sikes	Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell asleep. When he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and [MASK] was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which hung over the back of a chair.
OliverTwist	49	72782	72782	72831	Nancy	[MASK] was busily engaged in preparing breakfast. It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning, and it was quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was beating against the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.
OliverTwist	56	72984	72933	72989	Nancy	Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his, and, exchanging a farewell with [MASK], led him away.
OliverTwist	47	72990	72990	73037	Oliver	[MASK] turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope of meeting a look from the girl. But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it. CHAPTER XXI.
OliverTwist	53	74321	74314	74367	Sikes	"He's sulky," replied [MASK], giving him a shake; "he's sulky. A young dog! Don't mind him." "Not I!" rejoined the other, getting into his cart. "It's a fine day, after all."
OliverTwist	49	74716	74668	74717	Sikes	Being much tired with the walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first; then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep. It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from [MASK].
OliverTwist	41	74843	74803	74844	Ecod	My horse hasn't got a load behind him going back, as he had coming up in the mornin'; and he won't be long a-doing of it. Here's luck to him. [MASK]!
OliverTwist	55	74870	74845	74900	Sikes	he's a good 'un!" "Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?" demanded [MASK], pushing the ale towards his new friend. "If you're going directly, I can," replied the man, looking out of the pot.
OliverTwist	43	74941	74936	74979	Becky	"Is all paid, [MASK]?" "Yes, the other gentleman's paid," replied the girl. "I say!" said the man, with tipsy gravity; "that won't do, you know.
OliverTwist	59	75339	75290	75349	Sikes	A damp mist rose from the river, and the marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. It was piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy; and [MASK] was in no mood to lead him into conversation.
OliverTwist	47	75350	75350	75397	Oliver	[MASK] sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.
OliverTwist	54	75793	75744	75798	Sikes	The door yielded to the pressure, and they passed in together. CHAPTER XXII. THE BURGLARY "Hallo!" cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the passage. "Don't make such a row," said [MASK], bolting the door.
OliverTwist	46	76307	76306	76352	Bill	"[MASK], my boy!" said this figure, turning his head towards the door, "I'm glad to see you. I was almost afraid you'd given it up: in which case I should have made a personal wentur.
OliverTwist	44	76518	76513	76557	Sikes	"Now," said [MASK], as he resumed his seat, "if you'll give us something to eat and drink while we're waiting, you'll put some heart in us; or in me, at all events.
OliverTwist	59	77386	77355	77414	Oliver	The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that, although no rain fell, [MASK]'s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture that was floating about.
OliverTwist	51	77482	77481	77532	Toby	" [MASK] acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted. A dim light shone at intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night.
OliverTwist	50	77684	77676	77726	Oliver	And now, for the first time, [MASK], well-nigh mad with grief and terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the expedition. He clasped his hands together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror.
OliverTwist	44	77882	77861	77905	Toby	The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the pistol, when [MASK], striking it from his grasp, placed his hand upon the boy's mouth, and dragged him to the house.
OliverTwist	51	77956	77921	77972	Bill	Say another word, and I'll do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel. Here, [MASK], wrench the shutter open. He's game enough now, I'll engage.
OliverTwist	53	78250	78198	78251	Toby	Take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in." "There's a bolt at the top, you won't be able to reach," interposed [MASK].
OliverTwist	54	78378	78332	78386	Barney	"The game of that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog, who's got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful. Ha! ha! [MASK] 'ticed him away to-night.
OliverTwist	47	78420	78420	78467	Toby	[MASK] complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of his back.
OliverTwist	41	78546	78546	78587	Sikes	[MASK], pointing to the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he would fall dead that instant.
OliverTwist	47	78598	78588	78635	Sikes	"It's done in a minute," said [MASK], in the same low whisper. "Directly I leave go of you, do your work. Hark!" "What's that?" whispered the other man. They listened intently.
OliverTwist	42	78749	78721	78763	Oliver	"Back! back!" Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a loud cry which followed it, [MASK] let his lantern fall, and knew not whether to advance or fly.
OliverTwist	45	78812	78812	78857	Sikes	[MASK] had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away. He fired his own pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up.
OliverTwist	49	78866	78838	78887	Sikes	He fired his own pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up. "Clasp your arm tighter," said [MASK], as he drew him through the window. "Give me a shawl here. They've hit him.
OliverTwist	58	82574	82519	82577	Nature	It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the matron's room. Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with palsy; her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of [MASK]'s hand.
OliverTwist	52	83341	83301	83353	Anny	The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position, they began to converse in a low voice. "Did she say any more, [MASK] dear, while I was gone?" inquired the messenger.
OliverTwist	51	83783	83754	83805	Martha	He'll be here soon enough for us all." "Hold your tongue, you doting idiot!" said the matron sternly. "You, [MASK], tell me; has she been in this way before?" "Often," answered the first woman.
OliverTwist	52	85933	85906	85958	Newgate	Nobody accepting the challenge, and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground-plan of [MASK] on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar shrillness.
OliverTwist	56	85998	85988	86044	Fagin	"What do you think he's thinking of, [MASK]?" "How should I know, my dear?" replied the Jew, looking round as he plied the bellows. "About his losses, maybe; or the little retirement in the country that he's just left, eh?
OliverTwist	49	86457	86425	86474	Fagin	It must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when you don't want to go out a-walking so much; eh, [MASK]?" "Ah, to be sure, my dear," replied the Jew.
OliverTwist	53	86610	86568	86621	Fagin	I don't know one of 'em that would do it besides you; not one of 'em, my dear." "I might have got clear off, if I'd split upon her; mightn't I, [MASK]?" angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe.
OliverTwist	58	86951	86895	86953	Fagin	"Hark!" cried the Dodger at this moment, "I heard the tinkler." Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs. The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in darkness. After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered [MASK] mysteriously.
OliverTwist	48	87116	87069	87117	Hush	"Where is he?" he asked. The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to leave the room. "Yes," said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; "bring him down. [MASK]!
OliverTwist	43	87253	87244	87287	Dodger	"Pop that shawl away in my castor, [MASK], so that I may know where to find it when I cut; that's the time of day! You'll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now.
OliverTwist	49	87449	87444	87493	Toby	To judge from appearances, [MASK] was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation. At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought; but in vain.
OliverTwist	49	87580	87573	87622	Toby	It was all of no use. [MASK] continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.
OliverTwist	44	87763	87744	87788	Sikes	"Mean!" cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. "Where are they? [MASK] and the boy! Where are they? Where have they been? Where are they hiding? Why have they not been here?
OliverTwist	51	87797	87782	87833	Toby	Why have they not been here?" "The crack failed," said [MASK] faintly. "I know it," replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it. "What more?" "They fired and hit the boy.
OliverTwist	53	87861	87821	87874	Damme	"What more?" "They fired and hit the boy. We cut over the fields at the back, with him between us straight as the crow flies through hedge and ditch. They gave chase. [MASK]! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us.
OliverTwist	49	87882	87863	87912	Bill	the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us." "The boy!" "[MASK] had him on his back, and scudded like the wind. We stopped to take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold.
OliverTwist	42	88622	88585	88627	Fagin	"Well, I've heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before," replied the trader; "but it soon cools down again; don't you find it so?" [MASK] nodded in the affirmative.
OliverTwist	53	88703	88692	88745	Sikes	I don't think your friend's there." "[MASK] is not, I suppose?" inquired the Jew, with a disappointed countenance. "_Non istwentus_, as the lawyers say," replied the little man, shaking his head, and looking amazingly sly.
OliverTwist	51	88995	88984	89035	Fagin	Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, [MASK] walked straight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with his hand, as if in search of some particular person.
OliverTwist	54	89789	89745	89799	Barney	"He won't stir till it's all safe. Depend on it, they're on the scent down there; and that if he moved, he'd blow upon the thing at once. He's all right enough, [MASK] is, else I should have heard of him.
OliverTwist	43	89806	89800	89843	Barney	I'll pound it, that [MASK]'s managing properly. Let him alone for that." "Will _he_ be here to-night?" asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before.
OliverTwist	49	89845	89844	89893	Monks	"[MASK], do you mean?" inquired the landlord, hesitating. "Hush!" said the Jew. "Yes." "Certain," replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; "I expected him here before now.
OliverTwist	46	90082	90081	90127	Phil	"[MASK] has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him; so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry lives _while they last_. Ha! ha! ha!"
OliverTwist	53	90261	90261	90314	Fagin	[MASK] crept softly upstairs, and entered it without any previous ceremony. The girl was alone; lying with her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it. "She has been drinking," thought the Jew, cooly, "or perhaps she is only miserable.
OliverTwist	57	90430	90377	90434	Sikes	She pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but this was all. During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of [MASK] having covertly returned.
OliverTwist	49	90954	90953	91002	Fagin	pursued [MASK], mad with rage. "When the boy's worth hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle away the lives of!
OliverTwist	49	91143	91107	91156	Nancy	After a short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion. He appeared somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her. "[MASK], dear!" croaked the Jew, in his usual voice.
OliverTwist	47	91187	91185	91232	Bill	"If [MASK] has not done it this time, he will another. He has done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and when he can't he won't; so no more about that.
OliverTwist	52	91378	91357	91409	Nancy	"You must say it all over again, if it's anything you want me to do," rejoined [MASK]; "and if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow. You put me up for a minute; but now I'm stupid again.
OliverTwist	59	91411	91410	91469	Fagin	" [MASK] put several other questions: all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but, she answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor, was confirmed.
OliverTwist	45	91856	91855	91900	Fagin	"[MASK]!" whispered a voice close to his ear. "Ah!" said the Jew, turning quickly round, "is that " "Yes!" interrupted the stranger. "I have been lingering here these two hours.
OliverTwist	50	92164	92132	92182	Fagin	"It's as dark as the grave," said the man, groping forward a few steps. "Make haste!" "Shut the door," whispered [MASK] from the end of the passage. As he spoke, it closed with a loud noise.
OliverTwist	47	92241	92200	92247	Fagin	"The wind blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. Look sharp with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole." [MASK] stealthily descended the kitchen stairs.
OliverTwist	47	92519	92496	92543	Fagin	Though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there, a listener might easily have perceived that [MASK] appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation.
OliverTwist	48	92659	92629	92677	Monks	exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders. "Why, do you mean to say you couldn't have done it, if you had chosen?" demanded [MASK], sternly. "Haven't you done it, with other boys, scores of times?
OliverTwist	46	92733	92710	92756	Monks	" "Whose turn would that have served, my dear?" inquired the Jew humbly. "Mine," replied [MASK]. "But not mine," said the Jew, submissively. "He might have become of use to me.
OliverTwist	47	92793	92747	92794	Monks	"He might have become of use to me. When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my good friend?" "What then?" demanded [MASK].
OliverTwist	54	92918	92883	92937	Charley	I had nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the beginning, or we labour in vain. What could I do? Send him out with the Dodger and [MASK]? We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I trembled for us all.
OliverTwist	44	92950	92920	92964	Monks	We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I trembled for us all." "_That_ was not my doing," observed [MASK]. "No, no, my dear!" renewed the Jew.
OliverTwist	41	93108	93101	93142	Monks	I know what these girls are, [MASK], well. As soon as the boy begins to harden, she'll care no more for him, than for a block of wood. You want him made a thief.
OliverTwist	55	93231	93231	93286	Fagin	[MASK]! I had no hand in it. Anything but his death, I told you from the first. I won't shed blood; it's always found out, and haunts a man besides. If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me?
OliverTwist	48	93328	93292	93340	Yonder	What's that?" "What!" cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both arms, as he sprung to his feet. "Where?" "[MASK]!" replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall.
OliverTwist	46	93455	93412	93458	Monks	They listened intently: a profound silence reigned throughout the house. "It's your fancy," said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his companion. "I'll swear I saw it!" replied [MASK], trembling.
OliverTwist	46	93600	93568	93614	Toby	"What do you think now?" said the Jew, when they had regained the passage. "Besides ourselves, there's not a creature in the house except [MASK] and the boys; and they're safe enough. See here!"
OliverTwist	51	95538	95526	95577	Corney	"The one little, little, little word, my blessed [MASK]?" "Ye ye yes!" sighed out the matron. "One more," pursued the beadle; "compose your darling feelings for only one more. When is it to come off?
OliverTwist	59	95704	95686	95745	Sowerberry	"Very good," said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; "I'll call at [MASK]'s as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning. Was it that as frightened you, love?" "It wasn't anything particular, dear," said the lady evasively.
OliverTwist	47	96925	96924	96971	Parliament	If [MASK] don't take their abominable courses under consideration, this country's ruined, and the character of the peasantry gone for ever!" With these words, the beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker's premises.
OliverTwist	49	97074	97072	97121	Sikes	" As [MASK] growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an instant, to look back at his pursuers.
OliverTwist	42	97309	97304	97346	Sikes	"Quicker!" cried [MASK], laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and drawing a pistol from his pocket. "Don't play booty with me." At this moment the noise grew louder.
OliverTwist	50	97347	97338	97388	Sikes	" At this moment the noise grew louder. [MASK], again looking round, could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them.
OliverTwist	52	98012	97977	98029	Brittles	"So I do," replied the man. "It's natural and proper to be afraid, under such circumstances. I am." "So am I," said [MASK]; "only there's no call to tell a man he is, so bounceably.
OliverTwist	58	98236	98227	98285	Giles	"You may depend upon it," said [MASK], "that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement. I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was climbing over it." By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment.
OliverTwist	50	98713	98711	98761	Oliver	But, [MASK] felt it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his bed of clay. At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering it, the boy awoke.
OliverTwist	52	98869	98853	98905	Oliver	After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged, [MASK]: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon his feet, and essayed to walk.
OliverTwist	45	99326	99315	99360	Oliver	It was the very house they had attempted to rob. [MASK] felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that, for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of flight. Flight!
OliverTwist	42	99720	99690	99732	Brittles	I fancied I heerd a noise." At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the housemaid to shut the door: who asked [MASK], who asked the tinker, who pretended not to hear.
OliverTwist	43	99861	99853	99896	Giles	I turned down the clothes"; continued [MASK], rolling back the table-cloth, "sat up in bed; and listened." The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated "Lor!" and drew their chairs closer together.
OliverTwist	45	99941	99933	99978	Brittles	I'll call up that poor lad, [MASK], and save him from being murdered in his bed; or his throat,' I says, may be cut from his right ear to his left, without his ever knowing it.'
OliverTwist	46	100080	100070	100116	Giles	" Of _shoes_, sir," said [MASK], turning upon him, and laying great emphasis on the word; "seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room.
OliverTwist	53	100249	100202	100255	Brittles	"He was as firm ah! pretty near as firm as I was." "I should have died at once, I'm sure, if it had been me," observed the housemaid. "You're a woman," retorted [MASK], plucking up a little.
OliverTwist	42	100579	100579	100621	Brittles	[MASK] capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat re-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front.
OliverTwist	41	100890	100883	100924	Giles	"Here he is!" bawled [MASK], calling in a state of great excitement, up the staircase; "here's one of the thieves, ma'am! Here's a thief, miss! Wounded, miss!
OliverTwist	51	101129	101083	101134	Giles	I was soon too many for him." "Hush!" replied the young lady; "you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did. Is the poor creature much hurt?" "Wounded desperate, miss," replied [MASK], with indescribable complacency.
OliverTwist	55	101150	101135	101190	Brittles	"He looks as if he was a-going, miss," bawled [MASK], in the same manner as before. "Wouldn't you like to come and look at him, miss, in case he should?" "Hush, pray; there's a good man!"
OliverTwist	45	101357	101347	101392	Giles	"Poor fellow! Oh! treat him kindly, [MASK] for my sake!" The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child.
OliverTwist	51	101397	101363	101414	Oliver	The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child. Then, bending over [MASK], he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman.
OliverTwist	50	101431	101418	101468	OLIVER	HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH [MASK] RESORTED In a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a well-spread breakfast-table.
OliverTwist	49	102016	102008	102057	Brittles	And seeing, by the bye, that [MASK] had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one. "He gets worse instead of better, I think," said the elder lady.
OliverTwist	57	102527	102471	102528	Giles	"Honour, eh?" said the doctor; "well, I don't know; perhaps it's as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at twelve paces. Fancy that he fired in the air, and you've fought a duel, [MASK].
OliverTwist	55	103460	103411	103466	Oliver	The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence. Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered [MASK]'s hair from his face.
OliverTwist	42	103745	103704	103746	Rose	The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims." "But, can you oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?" said [MASK].
OliverTwist	46	103989	103946	103992	Rose	" "My dear love," said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom, "do you think I would harm a hair of his head?" "Oh, no!" replied [MASK], eagerly.
OliverTwist	43	104160	104160	104203	Giles	[MASK] is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides. You don't object to that?
OliverTwist	45	104256	104233	104278	Rose	"No other, take my word for it." "Then my aunt invests you with full power," said [MASK], smiling through her tears; "but pray don't be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary.
OliverTwist	47	104606	104588	104635	Rose	"Is is a bargain?" "He cannot be hardened in vice," said [MASK]; "It is impossible." "Very good," retorted the doctor; "then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition.
OliverTwist	48	104658	104613	104661	Oliver	" "Very good," retorted the doctor; "then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition." Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait, with some impatience, until [MASK] should awake.
OliverTwist	58	104791	104791	104849	Oliver	[MASK] told them all his simple history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him.
OliverTwist	52	105436	105412	105464	Brittles	If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I wouldn't cut a boy off: no, not even [MASK] here; not for all the plate in the county, sir." "That's not the point," said the doctor, mysteriously.
OliverTwist	51	105630	105601	105652	Giles	The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that [MASK] and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.
OliverTwist	45	106104	106090	106135	Brittles	" "What?" cried the doctor. "Yes," replied [MASK]; "I sent a message up by the coachman, and I only wonder they weren't here before, sir." "You did, did you?
OliverTwist	58	106170	106136	106194	Brittles	Then confound your slow coaches down here; that's all," said the doctor, walking away. CHAPTER XXXI. INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION "Who's that?" inquired [MASK], opening the door a little way, with the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand.
OliverTwist	51	106230	106223	106274	Brittles	" Much comforted by this assurance, [MASK] opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there.
OliverTwist	53	106901	106859	106912	Blathers	"This is all about the robbery, is it?" "All," replied the doctor. "Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking on?" said [MASK]. "Nothing at all," replied the doctor.
OliverTwist	51	106963	106913	106964	Duff	"One of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it's nonsense: sheer absurdity." "Wery easy disposed of, if it is," remarked [MASK].
OliverTwist	49	106975	106965	107014	Blathers	"What he says is quite correct," observed [MASK], nodding his head in a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if they were a pair of castanets. "Who is the boy? What account does he give of himself?
OliverTwist	47	107409	107403	107450	Rose	" "Surely," said [MASK], "the poor child's story, faithfully repeated to these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him." "I doubt it, my dear young lady," said the doctor, shaking his head.
OliverTwist	41	107514	107474	107515	Rose	What is he, after all, they would say? A runaway. Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his story is a very doubtful one." "You believe it, surely?" interrupted [MASK].
OliverTwist	56	107572	107565	107621	Rose	" "Why not?" demanded [MASK]. "Because, my pretty cross-examiner," replied the doctor: "because, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.
OliverTwist	56	107842	107811	107867	Rose	As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself! Don't you see all this?" "I see it, of course," replied [MASK], smiling at the doctor's impetuosity; "but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the poor child.
OliverTwist	54	108216	108183	108237	Blathers	We must make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours. Come in!" "Well, master," said [MASK], entering the room followed by his colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more.
OliverTwist	43	108281	108267	108310	Blathers	"We call it a put-up robbery, ladies," said [MASK], turning to them, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor's, "when the servants is in it.
OliverTwist	57	108418	108407	108464	Blathers	"There was two of 'em in it," continued [MASK]; "and they had a boy with 'em; that's plain from the size of the window. That's all to be said at present. We'll see this lad that you've got upstairs at once, if you please.
OliverTwist	52	108533	108522	108574	Blathers	" "Why, thank you, miss!" said [MASK], drawing his coat-sleeve across his mouth; "it's dry work, this sort of duty. Anythink that's handy, miss; don't put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.
OliverTwist	59	108613	108555	108614	Blathers	Anythink that's handy, miss; don't put yourself out of the way, on our accounts." "What shall it be?" asked the doctor, following the young lady to the sideboard. "A little drop of spirits, master, if it's all the same," replied [MASK].
OliverTwist	41	108875	108849	108890	Rose	What a start that was! Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see!" "What was that?" inquired [MASK]: anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors.
OliverTwist	52	109148	109125	109177	Conkey	They set up a hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about 'em, found that [MASK] had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost 'em.
OliverTwist	49	109381	109380	109429	Spyers	says [MASK]. I was so struck all of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,' says the poor man; but we're sure to have him; for between ten and eleven o'clock at night he passed again.'
OliverTwist	47	110397	110363	110410	Giles	I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir." "Thought it was what boy?" inquired the senior officer. "The housebreaker's boy, sir!" replied [MASK]. "They they certainly had a boy." "Well?
OliverTwist	48	110552	110510	110558	Blathers	"I don't think it is the boy; indeed, I'm almost certain that it isn't. You know it can't be." "Has this man been a-drinking, sir?" inquired [MASK], turning to the doctor.
OliverTwist	49	111584	111536	111585	Oliver	The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days. We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble." "The trouble!" cried [MASK].
OliverTwist	53	111877	111843	111896	Oliver	" "To whom?" inquired the young lady. "To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of me before," rejoined [MASK]. "If they knew how happy I am, they would be pleased, I am sure.
OliverTwist	49	112075	112034	112083	Oliver	"What's the matter with the boy?" cried the doctor, as usual, all in a bustle. "Do you see anything hear anything feel anything eh?" "That, sir," cried [MASK], pointing out of the carriage window.
OliverTwist	51	112134	112084	112135	Oliver	"That house!" "Yes; well, what of it? Stop coachman. Pull up here," cried the doctor. "What of the house, my man; eh?" "The thieves the house they took me to!" whispered [MASK].
OliverTwist	45	112201	112200	112245	Halloa	"[MASK]?" said a little ugly hump-backed man: opening the door so suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick, nearly fell forward into the passage. "What's the matter here?
OliverTwist	50	112348	112346	112396	Sikes	Where's [MASK], you thief?" The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor's grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the house.
OliverTwist	56	112450	112397	112453	Oliver	Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of parley. He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the cupboards; answered [MASK]'s description!
OliverTwist	43	112908	112901	112944	Oliver	"Did you know that before, [MASK]?" "No, sir." "Then don't forget it another time." "An ass," said the doctor again, after a further silence of some minutes.
OliverTwist	46	113138	113109	113155	Oliver	If the truth must be told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of [MASK]'s story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any.
OliverTwist	58	113167	113156	113214	Oliver	He soon came round again, however; and finding that [MASK]'s replies to his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that time forth.
OliverTwist	43	113281	113274	113317	Oliver	"That! That!" replied [MASK], pointing eagerly out of the window. "The white house. Oh! make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I should die: it makes me tremble so.
OliverTwist	48	113365	113318	113366	Oliver	" "Come, come!" said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder. "You will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well." "Oh! I hope so!" cried [MASK].
OliverTwist	50	113415	113383	113433	Oliver	" The coach rolled on. It stopped. No; that was the wrong house; the next door. It went on a few paces, and stopped again. [MASK] looked up at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face. Alas!
OliverTwist	50	113643	113631	113681	Oliver	" "The book-stall keeper, sir?" said [MASK]. "I know the way there. See him, pray, sir! Do see him!" "My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day," said the doctor.
OliverTwist	50	114656	114614	114664	Oliver	Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to write: and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that [MASK] could never try enough to please him.
OliverTwist	56	114875	114862	114918	Oliver	There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and [MASK] would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a perfect rapture. And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way in which he had ever spent it yet!
OliverTwist	45	115466	115459	115504	OLIVER	CHAPTER XXXIII. WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF [MASK] AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came. If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness.
OliverTwist	48	115631	115608	115656	Oliver	Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates. [MASK] had long since grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people.
OliverTwist	48	115839	115801	115849	Rose	After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping. "[MASK], my dear!" said the elder lady.
OliverTwist	42	115965	115953	115995	Rose	"No, no! Oh, not ill!" replied [MASK]: shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; "I shall be better presently. Close the window, pray!"
OliverTwist	42	115996	115989	116031	Oliver	Close the window, pray!" [MASK] hastened to comply with her request. The young lady, making an effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys.
OliverTwist	55	116098	116059	116114	Rose	"My child!" said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, "I never saw you so before." "I would not alarm you if I could avoid it," rejoined [MASK]; "but indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this.
OliverTwist	53	116411	116395	116448	Oliver	At length, she said, in a trembling voice: "I hope not, [MASK]. I have been very happy with her for some years: too happy, perhaps. It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is not this.
OliverTwist	54	116455	116429	116483	Oliver	It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is not this." "What?" inquired [MASK]. "The heavy blow," said the old lady, "of losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness.
OliverTwist	57	116493	116457	116514	Oliver	"The heavy blow," said the old lady, "of losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness." "Oh! God forbid!" exclaimed [MASK], hastily. "Amen to that, my child!" said the old lady, wringing her hands.
OliverTwist	42	116528	116497	116539	Oliver	"Amen to that, my child!" said the old lady, wringing her hands. "Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?" said [MASK]. "Two hours ago, she was quite well.
OliverTwist	55	116588	116569	116624	Oliver	Oh, what shall I do without her!" She gave way to such great grief, that [MASK], suppressing his own emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.
OliverTwist	49	116633	116625	116674	Oliver	"And consider, ma'am," said [MASK], as the tears forced themselves into his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary. "Oh! consider how young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her.
OliverTwist	52	116767	116750	116802	Oliver	But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding. I had forgotten it for a moment, [MASK], but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love.
OliverTwist	41	117160	117134	117175	Oliver	The people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I know." [MASK] could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.
OliverTwist	49	117861	117817	117866	Oliver	He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at that moment coming out of the inn door. "Hah!" cried the man, fixing his eyes on [MASK], and suddenly recoiling.
OliverTwist	45	117962	117927	117972	Oliver	"Who would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He'd start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!" "I am sorry," stammered [MASK], confused by the strange man's wild look.
OliverTwist	51	118064	118041	118092	Oliver	What are you doing here?" The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He advanced towards [MASK], as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him, but fell violently on the ground: writhing and foaming, in a fit.
OliverTwist	55	118303	118277	118332	Oliver	"In fact," he said, "it would be little short of a miracle, if she recovered." How often did [MASK] start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber!
OliverTwist	48	118612	118598	118646	Oliver	All the livelong day, and for hours after it had grown dark, [MASK] paced softly up and down the garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay stretched inside.
OliverTwist	51	118994	118982	119033	Oliver	But the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang on. [MASK] turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was.
OliverTwist	50	119334	119331	119381	Rose	"What of [MASK]?" cried the old lady. "Tell me at once! I can bear it; anything but suspense! Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!" "You must compose yourself," said the doctor supporting her.
OliverTwist	59	119817	119762	119821	Oliver	In another second or two, the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop: which he did, as soon as he could pull up his horses. Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same voice called [MASK] by his name.
OliverTwist	56	120076	120021	120077	Oliver	There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?" demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice. "Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled." "I would not for the world, sir," replied [MASK].
OliverTwist	43	120116	120105	120148	Oliver	I heard him say so." The tears stood in [MASK]'s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away, and remained silent, for some minutes.
OliverTwist	42	120149	120149	120191	Oliver	[MASK] thought he heard him sob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark for he could well guess what his feelings were and so stood apart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay.
OliverTwist	48	120288	120272	120320	Giles	"I think you had better go on to my mother's in the chaise, [MASK]," said he. "I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I see her. You can say I am coming.
OliverTwist	53	120518	120513	120566	Oliver	As they walked along, [MASK] glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer. He seemed about five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing.
OliverTwist	43	120587	120567	120610	Oliver	Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age, he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that [MASK] would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not already spoken of her as his mother.
OliverTwist	48	120713	120688	120736	Rose	" "But why," said the young man, "why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened? If [MASK] had I cannot utter that word now if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have forgiven yourself!
OliverTwist	51	121221	121176	121227	Harry	" "Mother," said the young man, impatiently, "he would be a selfish brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe, who acted thus." "You think so now, [MASK]," replied his mother.
OliverTwist	51	121284	121239	121290	Rose	"The mental agony I have suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have lightly formed. On [MASK], sweet, gentle girl!
OliverTwist	46	121563	121521	121567	Rose	My feelings remain unchanged, as they ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent, which can be productive of no earthly good? No! Before I leave this place, [MASK] shall hear me.
OliverTwist	46	121851	121806	121852	Rose	"I must go back to her. God bless you!" "I shall see you again to-night?" said the young man, eagerly. "By and by," replied the lady; "when I leave [MASK].
OliverTwist	48	123363	123325	123373	Oliver	There was no other dwelling near, in that direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive. One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth, [MASK] sat at this window, intent upon his books.
OliverTwist	43	123670	123670	123713	Oliver	[MASK] knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside. And yet he was asleep.
OliverTwist	52	123909	123895	123947	Oliver	" The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that [MASK] awoke with the fear, and started up. Good Heaven! what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move!
OliverTwist	46	124247	124219	124265	Oliver	"What direction did he take?" he asked, catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner. "That," replied [MASK], pointing out the course the man had taken; "I missed them in an instant.
OliverTwist	57	124278	124266	124323	Harry	" "Then, they are in the ditch!" said [MASK]. "Follow! And keep as near me, as you can." So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him.
OliverTwist	52	124550	124527	124579	Oliver	There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track [MASK] had pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time.
OliverTwist	45	124630	124620	124665	Oliver	"Oh no, indeed, sir," replied [MASK], shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch's countenance; "I saw him too plainly for that. I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.
OliverTwist	41	124704	124682	124723	Oliver	"The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the inn," said [MASK]. "We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I could swear to him.
OliverTwist	51	124809	124804	124855	Oliver	" The two gentlemen watched [MASK]'s earnest face, as he spoke, and looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said. Still, in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight.
OliverTwist	53	124929	124877	124930	Harry	The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of men's shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before. "This is strange!" said [MASK].
OliverTwist	42	125048	125019	125061	Giles	Of these, the Jew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen drinking, or loitering about; but [MASK] returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.
OliverTwist	45	125412	125411	125456	Rose	" [MASK] had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness. She merely bowed; and bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed.
OliverTwist	56	125995	125963	126019	Rose	Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has softened my heart to all mankind." "I did not mean that," said [MASK], weeping; "I only wish you had left here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again;
OliverTwist	52	126364	126329	126381	Rose	Confide some other passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most faithful friend you have." There was a pause, during which, [MASK], who had covered her face with one hand, gave free vent to her tears.
OliverTwist	41	126468	126428	126469	Harry	"You can say nothing to alter my resolution. It is a duty that I must perform. I owe it, alike to others, and to myself." "To yourself?" "Yes, [MASK].
OliverTwist	46	126569	126525	126571	Harry	I owe it to you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world." "If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty " [MASK] began.
OliverTwist	57	126753	126697	126754	Harry	Most painful to me, and yet productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it _will_ be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness. Farewell, [MASK]!
OliverTwist	51	126858	126839	126890	Rose	From your own lips, let me hear it!" "The prospect before you," answered [MASK], firmly, "is a brilliant one. All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life, are in store for you.
OliverTwist	52	127009	127004	127056	Harry	one more!" cried [MASK], throwing himself before her. "If I had been less less fortunate, the world would call it if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny if I had been poor, sick, helpless would you have turned from me then?
OliverTwist	49	127083	127057	127106	Rose	Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?" "Do not press me to reply," answered [MASK]. "The question does not arise, and never will. It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.
OliverTwist	49	127124	127096	127145	Harry	It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it." "If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is," retorted [MASK], "it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the path before me.
OliverTwist	48	127333	127313	127361	Rose	" Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded into the mind of [MASK], while making this avowal; but they brought tears with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they relieved her.
OliverTwist	54	127403	127385	127439	Harry	"I must leave you now, indeed." "I ask one promise," said [MASK]. "Once, and only once more, say within a year, but it may be much sooner, I may speak to you again on this subject, for the last time.
OliverTwist	41	127707	127673	127714	Harry	"Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two half-hours together!" "You will tell me a different tale one of these days," said [MASK], colouring without any perceptible reason.
OliverTwist	44	128398	128384	128428	Harry	"I would rather you did not mention it to them," said [MASK], hurrying over his words; "because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her.
OliverTwist	46	128452	128429	128475	Oliver	Let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything! I depend upon you." [MASK], quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance, faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications.
OliverTwist	41	128499	128492	128533	Giles	The doctor was in the chaise; [MASK] (who, it had been arranged, should be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants were in the garden, looking on.
OliverTwist	45	128534	128534	128579	Harry	[MASK] cast one slight glance at the latticed window, and jumped into the carriage. "Drive on!" he cried, "hard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me, to-day.
OliverTwist	52	128582	128566	128618	Halloa	Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me, to-day." "[MASK]!" cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great hurry, and shouting to the postillion; "something very short of flying will keep pace with _me_.
OliverTwist	51	128814	128791	128842	Rose	I am very, very glad." Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down [MASK]'s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.
OliverTwist	57	131513	131475	131532	Bumble	He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to have travelled some distance. He eyed [MASK] askance, as he entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation.
OliverTwist	54	133369	133321	133375	Bumble	On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name. The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him to ask it. "What do you want?" cried the man, turning quickly round, as [MASK] touched him on the arm.
OliverTwist	54	134078	134036	134090	Bumble	It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down. "The place should be somewhere here," said [MASK], consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand.
OliverTwist	54	134411	134405	134459	Monks	"Cooling yourselves!" retorted [MASK]. "Not all the rain that ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell's fire out, as a man can carry about with him. You won't cool yourself so easily; don't think it!"
OliverTwist	56	134465	134446	134502	Monks	You won't cool yourself so easily; don't think it!" With this agreeable speech, [MASK] turned short upon the matron, and bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.
OliverTwist	50	134611	134600	134650	Monks	"The loss of their own good name," replied [MASK]. "So, by the same rule, if a woman's a party to a secret that might hang or transport her, I'm not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I!
OliverTwist	59	134681	134672	134731	Monks	"Of course you don't!" said [MASK]. "How should you?" Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof.
OliverTwist	46	135140	135095	135141	Monks	"That's the second," observed the woman with much deliberation. "The first is, what may the communication be worth?" "Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?" asked [MASK].
OliverTwist	43	135372	135340	135383	Monks	"What's it worth to you?" asked the woman, as collectedly as before. "It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds," replied [MASK]. "Speak out, and let me know which.
OliverTwist	56	135436	135384	135440	Monks	" "Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold," said the woman; "and I'll tell you all I know. Not before." "Five-and-twenty pounds!" exclaimed [MASK], drawing back.
OliverTwist	53	135487	135486	135539	Monks	cried [MASK] impatiently; "and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more!" "Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in course of time," answered the matron, still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed.
OliverTwist	54	135591	135540	135594	Monks	"As to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!" "What if I pay it for nothing?" asked [MASK], hesitating.
OliverTwist	46	135889	135863	135909	Monks	" "He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can't speak in a lower tone," said [MASK], grimly. "So! He's your husband, eh?" "He my husband!"
OliverTwist	51	135931	135896	135947	Monks	He's your husband, eh?" "He my husband!" tittered the matron, parrying the question. "I thought as much, when you came in," rejoined [MASK], marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke.
OliverTwist	43	136086	136062	136105	Monks	" The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, [MASK], raising his face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say.
OliverTwist	58	136213	136203	136261	Monks	" "Was there no one by?" asked [MASK], in the same hollow whisper; "No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?" "Not a soul," replied the woman; "we were alone.
OliverTwist	55	136282	136232	136287	Monks	No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?" "Not a soul," replied the woman; "we were alone. _I_ stood alone beside the body when death came over it." "Good," said [MASK], regarding her attentively.
OliverTwist	58	136345	136339	136397	Monks	" "Ay?" said [MASK], with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder, "Blood! How things come about!" "The child was the one you named to him last night," said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; "the mother this nurse had robbed.
OliverTwist	46	136405	136360	136406	Monks	How things come about!" "The child was the one you named to him last night," said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; "the mother this nurse had robbed." "In life?" asked [MASK].
OliverTwist	56	136467	136422	136478	Monks	"She stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant's sake." "She sold it," cried [MASK], with desperate eagerness; "did she sell it?
OliverTwist	54	136527	136490	136544	Monks	" "As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this," said the matron, "she fell back and died." "Without saying more?" cried [MASK], in a voice which, from its very suppression, seemed only the more furious.
OliverTwist	46	136841	136807	136853	Monks	The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge." "Where is it now?" asked [MASK] quickly. "_There_," replied the woman.
OliverTwist	49	136884	136844	136893	Monks	"_There_," replied the woman. And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch, which [MASK] pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands.
OliverTwist	48	136922	136917	136965	Agnes	"It has the word [MASK]' engraved on the inside," said the woman. "There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born. I found out that.
OliverTwist	56	136975	136934	136990	Monks	"There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born. I found out that." "And this is all?" said [MASK], after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet.
OliverTwist	56	137211	137182	137238	Monks	"The other question?" "What do you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?" "Never," rejoined [MASK]; "nor against me either. See here! But don't move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.
OliverTwist	44	137296	137290	137334	Monks	"Look down," said [MASK], lowering the lantern into the gulf. "Don't fear me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.
OliverTwist	45	137511	137511	137556	Monks	[MASK] drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream.
OliverTwist	53	137600	137595	137648	Monks	"There!" said [MASK], closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back into its former position. "If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it.
OliverTwist	56	138595	138588	138644	Sikes	"Whining are you?" said [MASK]. "Come! Don't stand snivelling there. If you can't do anything better than that, cut off altogether. D'ye hear me?" "I hear you," replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a laugh.
OliverTwist	47	138672	138645	138692	Sikes	"What fancy have you got in your head now?" "Oh! you've thought better of it, have you?" growled [MASK], marking the tear which trembled in her eye. "All the better for you, you have.
OliverTwist	44	138714	138683	138727	Bill	"All the better for you, you have." "Why, you don't mean to say, you'd be hard upon me to-night, [MASK]," said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.
OliverTwist	50	139362	139348	139398	Fagin	"Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?" he asked [MASK]. "No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and I've brought something good with me, that you'll be glad to see.
OliverTwist	54	139795	139762	139816	Fagin	What do you mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted wagabond?" "Only hear him, boys!" said [MASK], shrugging his shoulders. "And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.
OliverTwist	53	139965	139925	139978	Sikes	"Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market! He'd make his fortun' on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma besides." "Hold your din," cried [MASK], as the dog retreated under the bed: still growling angrily.
OliverTwist	53	140063	140033	140086	Bill	"What about the other fortnight that you've left me lying here, like a sick rat in his hole?" "I couldn't help it, [MASK]. I can't go into a long explanation before company; but I couldn't help it, upon my honour.
OliverTwist	48	140095	140087	140135	Sikes	" "Upon your what?" growled [MASK], with excessive disgust. "Here! Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it'll choke me dead.
OliverTwist	52	140150	140101	140153	Fagin	"Here! Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it'll choke me dead." "Don't be out of temper, my dear," urged [MASK], submissively.
OliverTwist	59	140557	140514	140573	Sikes	"I haven't so much as would " "I don't know how much you've got, and I dare say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it," said [MASK]; "but I must have some to-night; and that's flat.
OliverTwist	53	141577	141571	141624	Nancy	It's a poor trade, [MASK], and no thanks; but I'm fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all. Hush!" he said, hastily concealing the key in his breast; "who's that?
OliverTwist	56	141751	141706	141762	Fagin	The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the heat: in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action: which, however, had been unobserved by [MASK], who had his back towards her at the time.
OliverTwist	49	141802	141767	141816	Nance	he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; "it's the man I expected before; he's coming downstairs. Not a word about the money while he's here, [MASK]. He won't stop long. Not ten minutes, my dear.
OliverTwist	45	142075	142035	142080	Monks	"I have been prompt enough this time. Let me have a word with you." The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she could see that [MASK] was pointing to her.
OliverTwist	52	142137	142115	142167	Fagin	"Not that infernal hole we were in before," she could hear the man say as they went upstairs. [MASK] laughed; and making some reply which did not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to the second story.
OliverTwist	52	142280	142245	142297	Monks	The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards, the two men were heard descending. [MASK] went at once into the street; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money.
OliverTwist	48	142321	142318	142366	Nance	"Why, [MASK]!" exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle, "how pale you are!" "Pale!" echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look steadily at him.
OliverTwist	44	142432	142409	142453	Fagin	"Come! Let me get back; that's a dear." With a sigh for every piece of money, [MASK] told the amount into her hand. They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a "good-night.
OliverTwist	55	142949	142898	142953	Sikes	As that day closed in, the girl's excitement increased; and, when night came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire in her eye, that even [MASK] observed with astonishment.
OliverTwist	48	143076	143040	143088	Sikes	What's the matter?" "Matter!" replied the girl. "Nothing. What do you look at me so hard for?" "What foolery is this?" demanded [MASK], grasping her by the arm, and shaking her roughly.
OliverTwist	43	143111	143089	143132	Bill	"What is it? What do you mean? What are you thinking of?" "Of many things, [MASK]," replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so, pressing her hands upon her eyes.
OliverTwist	52	143186	143176	143228	Sikes	"I tell you wot it is," said [MASK]; "if you haven't caught the fever, and got it comin' on, now, there's something more than usual in the wind, and something dangerous too. You're not a-going to .
OliverTwist	55	143256	143249	143304	Sikes	"There ain't," said [MASK], fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the words to himself; "there ain't a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I'd have cut her throat three months ago. She's got the fever coming on; that's it.
OliverTwist	52	143727	143688	143740	Nancy	"It'll strike the hour in another quarter," said the man: raising his lantern to her face. "And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more," muttered [MASK]: brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.
OliverTwist	51	144139	144105	144156	Nancy	The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her. To him, [MASK] repeated her request. "What name am I to say?" asked the waiter.
OliverTwist	53	144168	144144	144197	Nancy	"What name am I to say?" asked the waiter. "It's of no use saying any," replied [MASK]. "Nor business?" said the man. "No, nor that neither," rejoined the girl. "I must see the lady.
OliverTwist	52	144605	144605	144657	Nancy	[MASK] remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs.
OliverTwist	52	144676	144675	144727	Brass	"[MASK] can do better than the gold what has stood the fire," said the second. The third contented herself with wondering "what ladies was made of"; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of "Shameful!" with which the Dianas concluded.
OliverTwist	50	144741	144722	144772	Nancy	with which the Dianas concluded. Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: [MASK] followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left her, and retired.
OliverTwist	50	145110	145061	145111	Rose	If I had taken offence, and gone away, as many would have done, you'd have been sorry for it one day, and not without reason either." "I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you," replied [MASK].
OliverTwist	49	145221	145175	145224	Rose	"Oh, lady, lady!" she said, clasping her hands passionately before her face, "if there was more like you, there would be fewer like me, there would there would!" "Sit down," said [MASK], earnestly.
OliverTwist	55	145505	145458	145513	Rose	I am younger than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement." "What dreadful things are these!" said [MASK], involuntarily falling from her strange companion.
OliverTwist	52	145687	145636	145688	Monks	"If you knew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to tell you what I have overheard. Do you know a man named [MASK]?
OliverTwist	43	145739	145697	145740	Rose	"He knows you," replied the girl; "and knew you were here, for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out." "I never heard the name," said [MASK].
OliverTwist	58	145936	145928	145986	Rose	" "For what purpose?" asked [MASK]. "He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of finding out," said the girl; "and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery.
OliverTwist	57	146054	146001	146058	Monks	" "And what occurred then?" "I'll tell you, lady. Last night he came again. Again they went upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me, again listened at the door. The first words I heard [MASK] say were these:
OliverTwist	50	146475	146466	146516	Rose	" "You do not mean," said [MASK], turning very pale, "to tell me that this was said in earnest?" "He spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did," replied the girl, shaking her head.
OliverTwist	48	146552	146529	146577	Monks	I know many who do worse things; but I'd rather listen to them all a dozen times, than to that [MASK] once. It is growing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this.
OliverTwist	52	146594	146555	146607	Rose	It is growing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this. I must get back quickly." "But what can I do?" said [MASK]. "To what use can I turn this communication without you?
OliverTwist	49	146962	146952	147001	Rose	" "It is never too late," said [MASK], "for penitence and atonement." "It is," cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; "I cannot leave him now! I could not be his death.
OliverTwist	53	147011	146970	147023	Rose	" "It is," cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; "I cannot leave him now! I could not be his death." "Why should you be?" asked [MASK]. "Nothing could save him," cried the girl.
OliverTwist	47	147068	147049	147096	Rose	He is the boldest, and has been so cruel!" "Is it possible," cried [MASK], "that for such a man as this, you can resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue? It is madness.
OliverTwist	42	147208	147198	147240	Rose	" "What am I to do?" said [MASK]. "I should not let you depart from me thus." "You should, lady, and I know you will," rejoined the girl, rising.
OliverTwist	46	147286	147241	147287	Rose	"You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness, and forced no promise from you, as I might have done." "Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?" said [MASK].
OliverTwist	54	147304	147288	147342	Oliver	"This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me, benefit [MASK], whom you are anxious to serve?" "You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret, and advise you what to do," rejoined the girl.
OliverTwist	45	147358	147343	147388	Rose	"But where can I find you again when it is necessary?" asked [MASK]. "I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?
OliverTwist	53	147441	147389	147442	Rose	" "Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not be watched or followed?" asked the girl. "I promise you solemnly," answered [MASK].
OliverTwist	50	147770	147763	147813	Rose	" "You will," said [MASK], after a pause, "take some money from me, which may enable you to live without dishonesty at all events until we meet again?" "Not a penny," replied the girl, waving her hand.
OliverTwist	44	147830	147799	147843	Rose	" "Not a penny," replied the girl, waving her hand. "Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you," said [MASK], stepping gently forward. "I wish to serve you indeed.
OliverTwist	51	148034	148019	148070	Oliver	While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which [MASK]'s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl.
OliverTwist	43	148447	148431	148474	Harry	After more communing with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting [MASK]. "If it be painful to him," she thought, "to come back here, how painful it will be to me!
OliverTwist	42	148522	148505	148547	Rose	I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both." And here [MASK] dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.
OliverTwist	49	148704	148659	148708	Rose	"Oh dear! To think that I should see him at last, and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth!" "I never thought you had told us anything but the truth," said [MASK], soothing him.
OliverTwist	53	148826	148789	148842	Giles	I didn't speak to him I couldn't speak to him, for he didn't see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up to him. But [MASK] asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said he did.
OliverTwist	52	148848	148843	148895	Oliver	Look here," said [MASK], opening a scrap of paper, "here it is; here's where he lives I'm going there directly! Oh, dear me, dear me! What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!
OliverTwist	52	149370	149355	149407	Rose	"I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt," said [MASK], naturally embarrassed; "but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again.
OliverTwist	57	149719	149703	149760	Rose	"He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart," said [MASK], colouring; "and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.
OliverTwist	42	150189	150159	150201	Rose	You must pardon my finding fault with you, but why not have brought him?" "He is waiting in a coach at the door," replied [MASK]. "At this door!" cried the old gentleman.
OliverTwist	47	150649	150625	150672	Oliver	cried the old lady, embracing him; "it is my innocent boy!" "My dear old nurse!" cried [MASK]. "He would come back I knew he would," said the old lady, holding him in her arms.
OliverTwist	42	150771	150764	150806	Oliver	Running on thus, and now holding [MASK] from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns.
OliverTwist	58	151256	151222	151280	Oliver	"But reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view." "What object?" asked the doctor. "Simply, the discovery of [MASK]'s parentage, and regaining for him the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently deprived.
OliverTwist	52	151483	151457	151509	Monks	It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, [MASK], upon his knees. That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people.
OliverTwist	42	152740	152734	152776	Charlotte	What a lazybones yer are, [MASK]." "It's a heavy load, I can tell you," said the female, coming up, almost breathless with fatigue. "Heavy! What are yer talking about?
OliverTwist	45	152962	152960	153005	Noah	" As [MASK]'s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution, the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his side.
OliverTwist	49	153243	153243	153292	Cod	[MASK], yer may thanks yer stars I've got a head; for if we hadn't gone, at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer'd have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady.
OliverTwist	48	153317	153302	153350	Charlotte	" "I know I ain't as cunning as you are," replied [MASK]; "but don't put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up. You would have been if I had been, any way.
OliverTwist	53	153837	153831	153884	Noah	"Three Cripples," repeated [MASK], "and a very good sign too. Now, then! Keep close at my heels, and come along." With these injunctions, he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house, followed by his companion.
OliverTwist	44	154135	154135	154179	Barney	[MASK] complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting the required viands before them; having done which, he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable couple to their refreshment.
OliverTwist	56	154494	154488	154544	Barney	he whispered, looking round to [MASK], "I like that fellow's looks. He'd be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already. Don't make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear 'em talk let me hear 'em.
OliverTwist	59	154775	154759	154818	Noah	"I shall look out to get into company with them as can," replied [MASK]. "They'll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why, you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.
OliverTwist	59	154869	154845	154904	Noah	"There, that'll do: don't yer be too affectionate, in case I'm cross with yer," said [MASK], disengaging himself with great gravity. "I should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of 'em, and follering 'em about, unbeknown to themselves.
OliverTwist	45	155171	155162	155207	Charlotte	"Ha! ha! only hear that, [MASK]!" "Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear," replied the Jew, sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; "and that's the truth.
OliverTwist	46	155307	155302	155348	Fagin	"Dear!" said [MASK]. "A man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or a woman's reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he drinks it regularly.
OliverTwist	44	155397	155386	155430	Fagin	"Don't mind me, my dear," said [MASK], drawing his chair closer. "Ha! ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very lucky it was only me.
OliverTwist	52	155505	155486	155538	Fagin	" "No matter who's got it, or who did it, my dear," replied [MASK], glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk's eye at the girl and the two bundles. "I'm in that way myself, and I like you for it.
OliverTwist	46	155830	155804	155850	Noah	"Here! Let me have a word with you outside." "There's no occasion to trouble ourselves to move," said [MASK], getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again. "She'll take the luggage upstairs the while.
OliverTwist	47	155940	155900	155947	Fagin	"She's kept tolerably well under, ain't she?" he asked as he resumed his seat: in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal. "Quite perfect," rejoined [MASK], clapping him on the shoulder.
OliverTwist	44	155976	155948	155992	Noah	"You're a genius, my dear." "Why, I suppose if I wasn't, I shouldn't be here," replied [MASK]. "But, I say, she'll be back if yer lose time.
OliverTwist	47	156004	155993	156040	Fagin	" "Now, what do you think?" said [MASK]. "If you was to like my friend, could you do better than join him?" "Is he in a good way of business; that's where it is!"
OliverTwist	44	156042	156006	156050	Noah	"If you was to like my friend, could you do better than join him?" "Is he in a good way of business; that's where it is!" responded [MASK], winking one of his little eyes.
OliverTwist	48	156190	156160	156208	Fagin	"Twenty pound, though it's a lot of money!" "Not when it's in a note you can't get rid of," retorted [MASK]. "Number and date taken, I suppose? Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah!
OliverTwist	49	156248	156201	156250	Noah	Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah! It's not worth much to him. It'll have to go abroad, and he couldn't sell it for a great deal in the market." "When could I see him?" asked [MASK] doubtfully.
OliverTwist	55	156508	156454	156509	Fagin	"What do you think would suit me now? Something not too trying for the strength, and not very dangerous, you know. That's the sort of thing!" "I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my dear," said [MASK].
OliverTwist	47	156598	156580	156627	Noah	"No, it might not." "What do you think, then?" asked [MASK], anxiously regarding him. "Something in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not much more risk than being at home.
OliverTwist	55	156682	156643	156698	Noah	"There's a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running round the corner." "Don't they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?" asked [MASK], shaking his head. "I don't think that would answer my purpose.
OliverTwist	54	157374	157365	157419	Fagin	" "Don't believe that," said [MASK]. "When a man's his own enemy, it's only because he's too much his own friend; not because he's careful for everybody but himself. Pooh! pooh! There ain't such a thing in nature.
OliverTwist	53	157504	157484	157537	Fagin	"Number one for ever." "In a little community like ours, my dear," said [MASK], who felt it necessary to qualify this position, "we have a general number one, without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.
OliverTwist	49	157556	157550	157599	Fagin	"You see," pursued [MASK], affecting to disregard this interruption, "we are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must be so. For instance, it's your object to take care of number one meaning yourself.
OliverTwist	44	157840	157834	157878	Fagin	"The gallows," continued [MASK], "the gallows, my dear, is an ugly finger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow's career on the broad highway.
OliverTwist	53	158303	158298	158351	Fagin	"No," replied [MASK], "not very. He was charged with attempting to pick a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him, his own, my dear, his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it.
OliverTwist	58	158440	158431	158489	Fagin	"I'm doubtful about it," replied [MASK], with a sigh. "If they don't get any fresh evidence, it'll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it's a case of lagging.
OliverTwist	55	158857	158841	158896	Fagin	"What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!" exclaimed [MASK], darting an angry look at his pupil. "Wasn't he always the top-sawyer among you all! Is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent!
OliverTwist	47	159181	159144	159191	Charley	They'll all know what a clever fellow he was; he'll show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers. Think how young he is too! What a distinction, [MASK], to be lagged at his time of life!
OliverTwist	56	159234	159211	159267	Charley	"He shall have all he wants," continued the Jew. "He shall be kept in the Stone Jug, [MASK], like a gentleman. Like a gentleman! With his beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he can't spend it.
OliverTwist	45	159427	159407	159452	Charley	"He shall he will!" "Ah, to be sure, so he will," repeated [MASK], rubbing his hands. "I think I see him now," cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil.
OliverTwist	51	159831	159816	159867	Noah	" "Oh, I dare say about that, yer know," observed [MASK], backing towards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm. "No, no none of that. It's not in my department, that ain't.
OliverTwist	54	160134	160133	160187	Fagin	By [MASK]'s directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner's frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings: all of which articles the Jew had at hand. He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter's whip.
OliverTwist	47	162559	162543	162590	Sikes	It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour. [MASK] and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too. Eleven.
OliverTwist	50	162601	162572	162622	Sikes	The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too. Eleven. "An hour this side of midnight," said [MASK], raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat. "Dark and heavy it is too.
OliverTwist	41	162686	162671	162712	Fagin	"It is a pity, for I'm in the humour too." [MASK] sighed, and shook his head despondingly. "We must make up for lost time when we've got things into a good train.
OliverTwist	41	162736	162723	162764	Fagin	"That's the way to talk, my dear," replied [MASK], venturing to pat him on the shoulder. "It does me good to hear you." "Does you good, does it!"
OliverTwist	46	163030	163004	163050	Sikes	Where's the gal going to at this time of night?" "Not far." "What answer's that?" retorted [MASK]. "Do you hear me?" "I don't know where," replied the girl.
OliverTwist	48	163058	163032	163080	Sikes	"Do you hear me?" "I don't know where," replied the girl. "Then I do," said [MASK], more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed.
OliverTwist	51	163125	163087	163138	Sikes	" "I'm not well. I told you that before," rejoined the girl. "I want a breath of air." "Put your head out of the winder," replied [MASK]. "There's not enough there," said the girl.
OliverTwist	54	163158	163139	163193	Sikes	"I want it in the street." "Then you won't have it," replied [MASK]. With which assurance he rose, locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her head, flung it up to the top of an old press.
OliverTwist	49	163242	163194	163243	Bill	"There," said the robber. "Now stop quietly where you are, will you?" "It's not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me," said the girl turning very pale. "What do you mean, [MASK]?
OliverTwist	53	163342	163290	163343	Sikes	" "You'll drive me on the something desperate," muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak. "Let me go, will you, this minute this instant." "No!" said [MASK].
OliverTwist	48	163386	163380	163428	Sikes	"Hear you!" repeated [MASK] turning round in his chair to confront her. "Aye! And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as'll tear some of that screaming voice out.
OliverTwist	48	163472	163438	163486	Bill	Wot is it?" "Let me go," said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself down on the floor, before the door, she said, "[MASK], let me go; you don't know what you are doing.
OliverTwist	49	163512	163487	163536	Sikes	You don't, indeed. For only one hour do do!" "Cut my limbs off one by one!" cried [MASK], seizing her roughly by the arm, "If I don't think the gal's stark raving mad. Get up.
OliverTwist	55	163559	163559	163614	Sikes	[MASK] looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force.
OliverTwist	55	163740	163716	163771	Sikes	" "Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you think?" asked [MASK]. "Come; you should know her better than me. Wot does it mean?" "Obstinacy; woman's obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.
OliverTwist	47	163783	163753	163800	Sikes	Wot does it mean?" "Obstinacy; woman's obstinacy, I suppose, my dear." "Well, I suppose it is," growled [MASK]. "I thought I had tamed her, but she's as bad as ever.
OliverTwist	51	163831	163810	163861	Sikes	"I never knew her like this, for such a little cause." "Nor I," said [MASK]. "I think she's got a touch of that fever in her blood yet, and it won't come out eh?" "Like enough.
OliverTwist	55	163887	163833	163888	Sikes	"I think she's got a touch of that fever in her blood yet, and it won't come out eh?" "Like enough." "I'll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she's took that way again," said [MASK].
OliverTwist	53	164059	164017	164070	Sikes	Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing. "Why, now she's on the other tack!" exclaimed [MASK], turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion.
OliverTwist	58	164153	164121	164179	Sikes	He paused when he reached the room-door, and looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs. "Light him down," said [MASK], who was filling his pipe. "It's a pity he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers.
OliverTwist	43	164186	164180	164223	Nancy	Show him a light." [MASK] followed the old man downstairs, with a candle. When they reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper.
OliverTwist	52	164229	164197	164249	Nancy	When they reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper. "What is it, [MASK], dear?" "What do you mean?" replied the girl, in the same tone.
OliverTwist	52	164350	164330	164382	Nance	"No matter just now. We'll talk of this again. You have a friend in me, [MASK]; a staunch friend. I have the means at hand, quiet and close. If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog like a dog!
OliverTwist	47	164420	164397	164444	Nance	I say, come to me. He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, [MASK]." "I know you well," replied the girl, without manifesting the least emotion. "Good-night.
OliverTwist	49	164451	164440	164489	Fagin	"Good-night." She shrank back, as [MASK] offered to lay his hand on hers, but said good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.
OliverTwist	42	164532	164507	164549	Nancy	He had conceived the idea not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by degrees that [MASK], wearied of the housebreaker's brutality, had conceived an attachment for some new friend.
OliverTwist	54	164827	164819	164873	Fagin	" These things passed through the mind of [MASK], during the short time he sat alone, in the housebreaker's room; and with them uppermost in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting.
OliverTwist	54	164999	164969	165023	Sikes	If, without extracting a confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to [MASK] (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs, could he not secure her compliance?
OliverTwist	51	165030	165024	165075	Fagin	"I can," said [MASK], almost aloud. "She durst not refuse me then. Not for her life, not for her life! I have it all. The means are ready, and shall be set to work. I shall have you yet!
OliverTwist	48	165228	165219	165267	Noah	"Well, here I am," returned [MASK]. "What's the matter? Don't yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating. That's a great fault in this place. Yer never get time enough over yer meals.
OliverTwist	49	165283	165250	165299	Fagin	That's a great fault in this place. Yer never get time enough over yer meals." "You can talk as you eat, can't you?" said [MASK], cursing his dear young friend's greediness from the very bottom of his heart.
OliverTwist	52	165367	165340	165392	Noah	"I sent her out this morning with the other young woman, because I wanted us to be alone." "Oh!" said [MASK]. "I wish yer'd ordered her to make some buttered toast first. Well. Talk away. Yer won't interrupt me.
OliverTwist	49	165435	165387	165436	Fagin	Yer won't interrupt me." There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business. "You did well yesterday, my dear," said [MASK].
OliverTwist	46	165663	165656	165702	Bolter	" "I say," rejoined [MASK], "don't yer go shoving me into danger, or sending me any more o' yer police-offices. That don't suit me, that don't; and so I tell yer.
OliverTwist	56	165896	165878	165934	Fagin	"If you do it well, a pound, my dear. One pound," said [MASK], wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible. "And that's what I never gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn't valuable consideration to be gained.
OliverTwist	48	166045	166006	166054	Fagin	"Just to have the pleasure of knowing them, if they're respectable people, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I'm your man." "I knew you would be," cried [MASK], elated by the success of his proposal.
OliverTwist	43	166064	166055	166098	Noah	"Of course, of course," replied [MASK]. "Where is she? Where am I to wait for her? Where am I to go?" "All that, my dear, you shall hear from me.
OliverTwist	53	166111	166071	166124	Fagin	Where am I to wait for her? Where am I to go?" "All that, my dear, you shall hear from me. I'll point her out at the proper time," said [MASK]. "You keep ready, and leave the rest to me.
OliverTwist	46	166158	166113	166159	Fagin	"You keep ready, and leave the rest to me." That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter's dress: ready to turn out at a word from [MASK].
OliverTwist	49	166171	166160	166209	Fagin	Six nights passed six long weary nights and on each, [MASK] came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet time. On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he could not conceal. It was Sunday.
OliverTwist	49	166220	166206	166255	Fagin	It was Sunday. "She goes abroad to-night," said [MASK], "and on the right errand, I'm sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak.
OliverTwist	48	166475	166472	166520	Barney	He signed to [MASK], who withdrew. In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to the girl, caused her to raise her face.
OliverTwist	52	166563	166563	166615	Fagin	[MASK] drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered. "Hist!" cried the lad who held the door.
OliverTwist	53	167507	167466	167519	Nancy	They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up brushed against them, indeed at that precise moment. "Not here," said [MASK] hurriedly, "I am afraid to speak to you here.
OliverTwist	55	168107	168064	168119	Nancy	Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?" "I told you before," replied [MASK], "that I was afraid to speak to you there.
OliverTwist	50	168634	168613	168663	Nancy	" These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording [MASK] time to recover herself. The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her. "You were not here last Sunday night," he said.
OliverTwist	46	168672	168651	168697	Nancy	"You were not here last Sunday night," he said. "I couldn't come," replied [MASK]; "I was kept by force." "By whom?" "Him that I told the young lady of before.
OliverTwist	46	168995	168957	169003	Fagin	But if if " said the gentleman, "he cannot be secured, or, if secured, cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew." "[MASK]," cried the girl, recoiling.
OliverTwist	51	169383	169340	169391	Rose	In such a case I could show you reasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it." "Have I the lady's promise for that?" asked the girl. "You have," replied [MASK]. "My true and faithful pledge.
OliverTwist	48	169394	169392	169440	Monks	" "[MASK] would never learn how you knew what you do?" said the girl, after a short pause. "Never," replied the gentleman. "The intelligence should be brought to bear upon him, that he could never even guess.
OliverTwist	48	170106	170092	170140	Nancy	What can I do to serve you?" "Nothing," replied [MASK]. "You will not persist in saying that," rejoined the gentleman, with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart.
OliverTwist	52	171743	171692	171744	Sikes	The bell rang gently as he spoke. He crept upstairs to the door, and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of [MASK].
OliverTwist	56	171795	171759	171815	Fagin	"Take care of that, and do the most you can with it. It's been trouble enough to get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago." [MASK] laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat down again without speaking.
OliverTwist	44	171914	171902	171946	Fagin	"Wot do you look at a man so for?" [MASK] raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone.
OliverTwist	50	172027	172003	172053	Sikes	I've no no fault to find with you." "Oh, you haven't, haven't you?" said [MASK], looking sternly at him, and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket. "That's lucky for one of us.
OliverTwist	52	172144	172128	172180	Sikes	"She has pretty well settled that, in her own mind, already." [MASK] looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew's face, and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.
OliverTwist	58	172244	172188	172246	Fagin	he said; "or if you don't, it shall be for want of breath. Open your mouth and say wot you've got to say in plain words. Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!" "Suppose that lad that's laying there " [MASK] began.
OliverTwist	57	172452	172435	172492	Sikes	"Suppose he did all this, what then?" "What then!" replied [MASK]; with a tremendous oath. "If he was left alive till I came, I'd grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.
OliverTwist	49	172503	172459	172508	Fagin	"If he was left alive till I came, I'd grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head." "What if I did it!" cried [MASK] almost in a yell.
OliverTwist	43	172687	172674	172717	Fagin	"Whoever it was, I'd serve them the same." [MASK] looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent, stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse him.
OliverTwist	42	173121	173094	173136	Noah	"That's just what it was!" "What did they say, about last Sunday?" "About last Sunday!" replied [MASK], considering. "Why I told yer that before." "Again.
OliverTwist	52	173306	173273	173325	Noah	Tell him that, tell him that." "Why, that she couldn't very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to," said [MASK]; "and so the first time she went to see the lady, she ha! ha!
OliverTwist	45	173356	173348	173393	Sikes	" "Hell's fire!" cried [MASK], breaking fiercely from the Jew. "Let me go!" Flinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted, wildly and furiously, up the stairs.
OliverTwist	49	173459	173411	173460	Sikes	Only a word." The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence, when the Jew came panting up. "Let me out," said [MASK].
OliverTwist	51	173490	173461	173512	Fagin	"Don't speak to me; it's not safe. Let me out, I say!" "Hear me speak a word," rejoined [MASK], laying his hand upon the lock. "You won't be " "Well," replied the other.
OliverTwist	52	173521	173513	173565	Bill	"You won't be too violent, [MASK]?" The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see each other's faces. They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.
OliverTwist	46	173572	173544	173590	Fagin	They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken. "I mean," said [MASK], showing that he felt all disguise was now useless, "not too violent for safety.
OliverTwist	48	173801	173768	173816	Bill	He had roused her from her sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look. "Get up!" said the man. "It is you, [MASK]!" said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his return.
OliverTwist	55	173878	173830	173885	Sikes	" There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick, and hurled it under the grate. Seeing the faint light of early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain. "Let it be," said [MASK], thrusting his hand before her.
OliverTwist	48	174062	174029	174077	Heaven	returned the robber, suppressing his breath. "You were watched to-night; every word you said was heard." "Then spare my life for the love of [MASK], as I spared yours," rejoined the girl, clinging to him.
OliverTwist	47	174215	174214	174261	Bill	"[MASK]," cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast, "the gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace.
OliverTwist	47	176334	176328	176375	Sikes	" "Hah!" cried [MASK] starting up. "Give that back." "I'll take it clean out, sir," replied the man, winking to the company, "before you can come across the room to get it.
OliverTwist	50	176675	176667	176717	Ben	" "Anything new up in town, [MASK]?" asked the game-keeper, drawing back to the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses. "No, nothing that I knows on," replied the man, pulling on his gloves.
OliverTwist	50	176821	176778	176828	Ben	" "Was it, sir?" rejoined the guard, touching his hat. "Man or woman, pray, sir?" "A woman," replied the gentleman. "It is supposed " "Now, [MASK]," replied the coachman impatiently.
OliverTwist	52	176924	176900	176952	Sikes	Here, give hold. All ri ight!" The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone. [MASK] remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go.
OliverTwist	49	177299	177287	177336	Providence	Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that [MASK] must sleep. There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear. There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the night.
OliverTwist	50	178666	178653	178703	Sikes	The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as [MASK] stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and started back. "Come back!" said the robber. The dog wagged his tail, but moved not.
OliverTwist	47	178704	178704	178751	Sikes	[MASK] made a running noose and called him again. The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his hardest speed. The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return.
OliverTwist	51	179008	178958	179009	Monks	"If he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name." "How dare you say this of me?" asked [MASK].
OliverTwist	53	179135	179097	179150	Monks	If you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!" "By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by these dogs?" asked [MASK], looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him.
OliverTwist	50	179383	179342	179392	Monks	If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair. It has waited for you two whole days." [MASK] muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.
OliverTwist	58	180109	180056	180114	Monks	I know that of the wretched marriage, into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most unnatural issue." "I don't care for hard names," interrupted [MASK] with a jeering laugh.
OliverTwist	50	180521	180481	180531	Monks	Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?" "I have nothing to disclose," rejoined [MASK]. "You must talk on if you will.
OliverTwist	41	180999	180981	181022	Monks	so that the whole property fell to her and you." At this part of the recital [MASK] held his breath, and listened with a face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker.
OliverTwist	57	181446	181405	181462	Monks	The family had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night. Why, or whither, none can tell." [MASK] drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of triumph.
OliverTwist	50	181721	181696	181746	Monks	"I shall show you that I know more than that." "You you can't prove anything against me," stammered [MASK]. "I defy you to do it!" "We shall see," returned the old gentleman with a searching glance.
OliverTwist	50	181961	181951	182001	Monks	"And now you do see me," said [MASK], rising boldly, "what then? Fraud and robbery are high-sounding words justified, you think, by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man's Brother!
OliverTwist	48	182420	182396	182444	Monks	Murder has been done, to which you were morally if not really a party." "No, no," interposed [MASK]. "I I knew nothing of that; I was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me.
OliverTwist	53	182568	182516	182569	Monks	" "Remain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose of attesting it?" "If you insist upon that, I'll do that also," replied [MASK].
OliverTwist	57	182864	182862	182919	Harry	" "[MASK]? As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with you, he hurried off to where he heard this," replied the doctor, "and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.
OliverTwist	43	183854	183853	183896	Jacob	In [MASK]'s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke.
OliverTwist	58	183982	183927	183985	Jacob	The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die. They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in [MASK]'s Island.
OliverTwist	57	184608	184556	184613	Toby	"There's nowhere else to go to now, for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken I went up there and see it with my own eyes is filled with traps." "This is a smash," observed [MASK], biting his lips.
OliverTwist	47	184707	184695	184742	Chitling	" "You should have heard the people groan," said [MASK]; "the officers fought like devils, or they'd have torn him away. He was down once, but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along.
OliverTwist	52	184924	184892	184944	Sikes	While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs, and [MASK]'s dog bounded into the room. They ran to the window, downstairs, and into the street.
OliverTwist	49	184981	184945	184994	Toby	The dog had jumped in at an open window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be seen. "What's the meaning of this?" said [MASK] when they had returned. "He can't be coming here.
OliverTwist	49	185018	185000	185049	Kags	" "If he was coming here, he'd have come with the dog," said [MASK], stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor. "Here! Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.
OliverTwist	48	185064	185050	185098	Chitling	" "He's drunk it all up, every drop," said [MASK] after watching the dog some time in silence. "Covered with mud lame half blind he must have come a long way." "Where can he have come from!"
OliverTwist	43	185100	185089	185132	Toby	" "Where can he have come from!" exclaimed [MASK]. "He's been to the other kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here, where he's been many a time and often.
OliverTwist	53	185185	185133	185186	Chitling	But where can he have come from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!" "He" (none of them called the murderer by his old name) "He can't have made away with himself. What do you think?" said [MASK].
OliverTwist	42	185199	185192	185234	Kags	"If he had," said [MASK], "the dog 'ud want to lead us away to where he did it. No. I think he's got out of the country, and left the dog behind.
OliverTwist	50	185437	185419	185469	Crackit	The knocking came again. No, it wasn't he. He never knocked like that. [MASK] went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head. There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough.
OliverTwist	50	185545	185526	185576	Kags	He _must_ come in." "Don't leave us in the dark," said [MASK], taking down a candle from the chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.
OliverTwist	52	185786	185737	185789	Fagin	When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started. They seemed never to have heard its tones before. "How came that dog here?" he asked. "Alone. Three hours ago." "To-night's paper says that [MASK]'s took.
OliverTwist	55	185815	185790	185845	Sikes	Is it true, or a lie?" "True." They were silent again. "Damn you all!" said [MASK], passing his hand across his forehead. "Have you nothing to say to me?" There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.
OliverTwist	46	185906	185906	185952	Sikes	[MASK] carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him: rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it: and said, "Is it the body is it buried?" They shook their heads. "Why isn't it!"
OliverTwist	52	186193	186173	186225	Sikes	"You monster!" The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but [MASK]'s eyes sunk gradually to the ground. "Witness you three," cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and becoming more and more excited as he spoke.
OliverTwist	52	186664	186658	186710	Strokes	Break down the door!" [MASK], thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent.
OliverTwist	50	186730	186711	186761	Sikes	"Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell-babe," cried [MASK] fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. "That door. Quick!"
OliverTwist	49	186792	186759	186808	Crackit	Quick!" He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key. "Is the downstairs door fast?" "Double-locked and chained," replied [MASK], who, with the other two men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.
OliverTwist	56	188525	188515	188571	Oliver	They had not talked much upon the way; for [MASK] was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree.
OliverTwist	55	189083	189064	189119	Oliver	"You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one," said [MASK]. "It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again
OliverTwist	55	190837	190830	190885	Monks	" "My mother," said [MASK], in a louder tone, "did what a woman should have done. She burnt this will. The letter never reached its destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the blot.
OliverTwist	59	191156	191148	191207	Monks	" "There she died," said [MASK], "after a lingering illness; and, on her death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved though she need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before.
OliverTwist	43	191486	191456	191499	Monks	"I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse," answered [MASK] without raising his eyes. "You know what became of them.
OliverTwist	51	192193	192178	192229	Monks	"No," replied the woman; "if he" she pointed to [MASK] "has been coward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say.
OliverTwist	51	192608	192569	192620	Rose	You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say." "If they have I do not know how they can, but if they have any reference to me," said [MASK], "pray let me hear them at some other time.
OliverTwist	52	192672	192621	192673	Monks	I have not strength or spirits now." "Nay," returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his; "you have more fortitude than this, I am sure. Do you know this young lady, sir?" "Yes," replied [MASK].
OliverTwist	53	192828	192807	192860	Monks	"Go on!" "You couldn't find the spot to which these people had repaired," said [MASK], "but where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way. My mother found it, after a year of cunning search ay, and found the child.
OliverTwist	48	193177	193142	193190	Rose	I would not lose her now, for all the treasures of the world. My sweet companion, my own dear girl!" "The only friend I ever had," cried [MASK], clinging to her. "The kindest, best of friends.
OliverTwist	51	193281	193265	193316	Oliver	See here look, look, my dear!" "Not aunt," cried [MASK], throwing his arms about her neck; "I'll never call her aunt sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first!
OliverTwist	54	193538	193518	193572	Rose	Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?" "Stay," said [MASK]. "You _do_ know all." "All. You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the subject of our last discourse.
OliverTwist	58	193666	193649	193707	Rose	" "The same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now," said [MASK] firmly. "If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I ever feel it, as I should to-night?
OliverTwist	51	193903	193878	193929	Harry	"That a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all there, we have said enough, [MASK], we have said enough." "Not yet, not yet," said the young man, detaining her as she rose.
OliverTwist	53	194534	194482	194535	Fagin	The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man [MASK].
OliverTwist	49	194909	194909	194958	Hush	[MASK]! They only sought permission to retire. He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was fruitless. The jailer touched him on the shoulder.
OliverTwist	41	197151	197142	197183	Oliver	The man touched his hat; and glancing at [MASK] with some curiousity, opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.
OliverTwist	41	197478	197443	197484	Charley	His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision. "Good boy, [MASK] well done " he mumbled.
OliverTwist	49	198033	198018	198067	Oliver	I want to talk to you." "Yes, yes," returned [MASK]. "Let me say a prayer. Do! Let me say one prayer. Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.
OliverTwist	51	198076	198042	198093	Fagin	Do! Let me say one prayer. Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning." "Outside, outside," replied [MASK], pushing the boy before him towards the door, and looking vacantly over his head.
OliverTwist	53	198155	198135	198188	Fagin	cried the boy with a burst of tears. "That's right, that's right," said [MASK]. "That'll help us on. This door first. If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don't you mind, but hurry on.
OliverTwist	43	198283	198254	198297	Fagin	"You had better leave him." The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned. "Press on, press on," cried [MASK]. "Softly, but not so slow. Faster, faster!"
OliverTwist	55	198307	198298	198353	Oliver	The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging [MASK] from his grasp, held him back. He struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard.
OliverTwist	44	198364	198354	198398	Oliver	It was some time before they left the prison. [MASK] nearly swooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the strength to walk. Day was dawning when they again emerged.
OliverTwist	58	199371	199356	199414	Charlotte	His plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by [MASK] in respectable attire. The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next day, and pockets half the penalty.
OliverTwist	51	200161	200137	200188	AGNES	Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word: "[MASK]." There is no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above it!
OliverTwist	47	200229	200189	200236	Agnes	But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love the love beyond the grave of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of [MASK] sometimes hovers round that solemn nook.
