APassageToIndia	50	310	289	339	Eurasians	Inland, the prospect alters. There is an oval Maidan, and a long sallow hospital. Houses belonging to [MASK] stand on the high ground by the railway station. Beyond the railway which runs parallel to the river the land sinks, then rises again rather steeply.
APassageToIndia	49	1095	1059	1108	Aziz	"Imagine us both as addressing you from another and a happier world." "Does there happen to be such a thing as a hookah in that happier world of yours?" "[MASK], don't chatter. We are having a very sad talk.
APassageToIndia	53	1319	1313	1366	Aziz	"It is impossible here. [MASK]! The red-nosed boy has again insulted me in Court. I do not blame him. He was told that he ought to insult me. Until lately he was quite a nice boy, but the others have got hold of him.
APassageToIndia	49	1748	1706	1755	Aziz	When we poor blacks take bribes, we perform what we are bribed to perform, and the law discovers us in consequence. The English take and do nothing. I admire them." "We all admire them. [MASK], please pass me the hookah.
APassageToIndia	48	1816	1778	1826	Hamidullah	He raised his voice suddenly, and shouted for dinner. Servants shouted back that it was ready. They meant that they wished it was ready, and were so understood, for nobody moved. Then [MASK] continued, but with changed manner and evident emotion.
APassageToIndia	57	2249	2249	2306	Aziz	[MASK] did not know, but said he did. He too generalized from his disappointments it is difficult for members of a subject race to do otherwise. Granted the exceptions, he agreed that all Englishwomen are haughty and venal. The gleam passed from the conversation, whose wintry surface unrolled and expanded interminably.
APassageToIndia	49	2325	2307	2356	Aziz	A servant announced dinner. They ignored him. The elder men had reached their eternal politics, [MASK] drifted into the garden. The trees smelt sweet green-blossomed champak and scraps of Persian poetry came into his head. Dinner, dinner, dinner . . .
APassageToIndia	56	2495	2447	2503	Aziz	It was difficult to get away, because until they had had their dinner she would not begin hers, and consequently prolonged her remarks in case they should suppose she was impatient. Having censured the circumcision, she bethought her of kindred topics, and asked [MASK] when he was going to be married.
APassageToIndia	44	2528	2504	2548	Hamidullah	Respectful but irritated, he answered, "Once is enough." "Yes, he has done his duty," said [MASK]. "Do not tease him so. He carries on his family, two boys and their sister.
APassageToIndia	50	2551	2537	2587	Aunt	He carries on his family, two boys and their sister." "[MASK], they live most comfortably with my wife's mother, where she was living when she died. I can see them whenever I like. They are such very, very small children.
APassageToIndia	49	2814	2774	2823	Aziz	Wedlock, motherhood, power in the house for what else is she born, and how can the man who has denied them to her stand up to face her creator and his own at the last day? [MASK] took his leave saying "Perhaps . . .
APassageToIndia	49	3847	3802	3851	Aziz	He compromised, and stopped the driver just outside the flood of light that fell across the verandah. The Civil Surgeon was out. "But the sahib has left me some message?" The servant returned an indifferent "No." [MASK] was in despair.
APassageToIndia	55	3910	3877	3932	Aziz	He was convinced that there was a message, and that the man was withholding it out of revenge. While they argued, the people came out. Both were ladies. [MASK] lifted his hat. The first, who was in evening dress, glanced at the Indian and turned instinctively away.
APassageToIndia	43	3958	3948	3991	Aziz	"Ours?" enquired the second, also seeing [MASK], and doing likewise. "Take the gifts the gods provide, anyhow," she screeched, and both jumped in. "O Tonga wallah, club, club.
APassageToIndia	52	4013	3983	4035	Aziz	"O Tonga wallah, club, club. Why doesn't the fool go?" "Go, I will pay you to-morrow," said [MASK] to the driver, and as they went off he called courteously, "You are most welcome, ladies."
APassageToIndia	49	4300	4293	4342	Huzoor	Call me a tonga." "[MASK], all are at the club." "Then telephone for one down to the railway station." And since the man hastened to do this he said, "Enough, enough, I prefer to walk."
APassageToIndia	49	6481	6448	6497	Indians	" She accepted his escort back to the club, and said at the gate that she wished she was a member, so that she could have asked him in. "[MASK] are not allowed into the Chandrapore Club even as guests," he said simply.
APassageToIndia	50	6987	6938	6988	Adela	Neither of them knew the speaker nor did they ever see him again. He passed with his friendly word through red-brick pillars into the darkness. "We aren't even seeing the other side of the world; that's our complaint," said [MASK].
APassageToIndia	45	7337	7328	7373	Heaslop	"The long and the short of it is [MASK]'s a sahib; he's the type we want, he's one of us," and another civilian who was leaning over the billiard table said, "Hear, hear!"
APassageToIndia	49	7691	7672	7721	Indians	" She became the centre of an amused group of ladies. One said, "Wanting to see [MASK]! How new that sounds!" Another, "Natives! why, fancy!" A third, more serious, said, "Let me explain.
APassageToIndia	46	7791	7746	7792	Indians	" But the lady, entirely stupid and friendly, continued: "What I mean is, I was a nurse before my marriage, and came across them a great deal, so I know. I really do know the truth about [MASK].
APassageToIndia	48	8041	7994	8042	Fielding	"You can practically see any type you like. Take your choice. I know the Government people and the landowners, Heaslop here can get hold of the barrister crew, while if you want to specialize on education, we can come down on [MASK].
APassageToIndia	45	8594	8558	8603	Hullo	They know him they know he can't be fooled I'm still fresh comparatively. No one can even begin to think of knowing this country until he has been in it twenty years. [MASK], the mater! Here's your cloak.
APassageToIndia	49	9144	9135	9184	Adela	" "I was going to tell you, [MASK], but something changed the conversation and I forgot. My memory grows deplorable." "Was he nice?" She paused, then said emphatically: "Very nice." "Who was he?"
APassageToIndia	48	9185	9155	9203	Ronny	My memory grows deplorable." "Was he nice?" She paused, then said emphatically: "Very nice." "Who was he?" [MASK] enquired. "A doctor. I don't know his name." "A doctor?
APassageToIndia	50	9732	9731	9781	Adela	But [MASK], who meditated spending her life in the country, was a more serious matter; it would be tiresome if she started crooked over the native question. Pulling up the mare, he said, "There's your Ganges." Their attention was diverted.
APassageToIndia	47	10118	10117	10164	Aziz	"[MASK]! what a charming name!" "So you and he had a talk. Did you gather he was well disposed?" Ignorant of the force of this question, she replied, "Yes, quite, after the first moment.
APassageToIndia	51	10326	10326	10377	Aziz	[MASK] knew that when he spoke out, so don't you worry. He had some motive in what he said. My personal belief is that the remark wasn't true." "How not true?" "He abused the Major in order to impress you.
APassageToIndia	49	10687	10665	10714	Adela	Why?" "There you go again, mother I really can't explain every thing. I don't want [MASK] to be worried, that's the fact; she'll begin wondering whether we treat the natives properly, and all that sort of nonsense.
APassageToIndia	45	10854	10846	10891	Aziz	He had not forbidden her to think about [MASK], however, and she did this when she retired to her room. In the light of her son's comment she reconsidered the scene at the mosque, to see whose impression was correct.
APassageToIndia	55	11054	11036	11091	Bats	Perhaps he mistook the peg for a branch no Indian animal has any sense of an interior. [MASK], rats, birds, insects will as soon nest inside a house as out; it is to them a normal growth of the eternal jungle, which alternately produces houses trees, houses trees.
APassageToIndia	59	11241	11240	11299	Turton	"[MASK] would never do this unless compelled. Those high officials are different they sympathize, the Viceroy sympathizes, they would have us treated properly. But they come too seldom and live too far away. Meanwhile " "It is easy to sympathize at a distance," said an old gentleman with a beard.
APassageToIndia	58	11438	11433	11491	Dilkusha	I shall come in from [MASK] specially, though I have to postpone other business." "You will make yourself chip," suddenly said a little black man. There was a stir of disapproval. Who was this ill-bred upstart, that he should criticize the leading Mohammedan landowner of the district?
APassageToIndia	52	13438	13391	13443	Mary	At a little distance stood their male relatives, watching the venture. The sight was significant: an island bared by the turning tide, and bound to grow. "I consider they ought to come over to me." "Come along, [MASK], get it over.
APassageToIndia	49	13727	13726	13775	Advancing	" [MASK], she shook hands with the group and said a few words of welcome in Urdu. She had learnt the lingo, but only to speak to her servants, so she knew none of the politer forms and of the verbs only the imperative mood.
APassageToIndia	48	15373	15352	15400	Indians	" "I know, I know, and we never get down from it. I envy you being with [MASK]." "Do you care to meet one or two?" "Very, very much indeed; it's what I long for.
APassageToIndia	49	15703	15668	15717	Ronny	All the nice things are coming Thursday." "I won't ask the City Magistrate to bring you. I know he'll be busy at that time." "Yes, [MASK] is always hard-worked," she replied, contemplating the hills.
APassageToIndia	48	16426	16414	16462	Adela	He wanted her advice and support while resenting interference. "Does [MASK] talk to you much?" he began. "I'm so driven with work, I don't see her as much as I hoped, but I hope she finds things comfortable.
APassageToIndia	46	16473	16473	16519	Dear	[MASK], since you mention it, you're quite right you ought to be more alone with her than you are." "Yes, perhaps, but then people'ld gossip." "Well, they must gossip sometime! Let them gossip.
APassageToIndia	49	16598	16578	16627	Adela	They notice everything, until they're perfectly sure you're their sort." "I don't think [MASK] 'll ever be quite their sort she's much too individual." "I know, that's so remarkable about her," he said thoughtfully.
APassageToIndia	46	16849	16807	16853	Adela	" "What did I tell you?" he exclaimed, losing his gentle manner. "I knew it last week. Oh, how like a woman to worry over a side-issue!" She forgot about [MASK] in her surprise.
APassageToIndia	50	17034	16989	17039	Adela	Here we are, and we're going to stop, and the country's got to put up with us, gods or no gods. Oh, look here," he broke out, rather pathetically, "what do you and [MASK] want me to do?
APassageToIndia	41	17112	17075	17116	Adela	You neither of you understand what work is, or you 'ld never talk such eyewash. I hate talking like this, but one must occasionally. It's morbidly sensitive to go on as [MASK] and you do.
APassageToIndia	51	17882	17835	17886	Christianity	I suppose I ought to get off to my files now, and you'll be going to bed." "I suppose so, I suppose so." They did not part for a few minutes, but the conversation had become unreal since [MASK] had entered it.
APassageToIndia	51	18331	18287	18338	Aziz	And this did not dispose him any better towards his subordinate. There was a row the morning after the mosque they were always having rows. The Major, who had been up half the night, wanted damn well to know why [MASK] had not come promptly when summoned.
APassageToIndia	41	18577	18542	18583	Aziz	Caste "or something of the sort" would prevent them. He only knew that no one ever told him the truth, although he had been in the country for twenty years. [MASK] watched him go with amusement.
APassageToIndia	54	18839	18838	18892	Disaster	"[MASK] may come," he said politely, "but we shall at all events get there safe, even if we do not get back." And with more logic: "It will, I think, create a good impression should two doctors arrive at the same time.
APassageToIndia	52	18900	18894	18946	Aziz	But when the time came, [MASK] was seized with a revulsion, and determined not to go. For one thing his spell of work, lately concluded, left him independent and healthy. For another, the day chanced to fall on the anniversary of his wife's death.
APassageToIndia	45	18970	18968	19013	Western	Touched by [MASK] feeling, he disliked union with a woman whom he had never seen; moreover, when he did see her, she disappointed him, and he begat his first child in mere animality. The change began after its birth.
APassageToIndia	50	19733	19702	19752	Orientals	It was unbearable, and he thought again, "How unhappy I am!" and became happier. He had breathed for an instant the mortal air that surrounds [MASK] and all men, and he drew back from it with a gasp, for he was young.
APassageToIndia	45	19876	19832	19877	Hamidullah	The notes interesting him on their own account, he locked the photograph up again. Its moment was over, and he did not think about his wife any more. After tea his spirits improved, and he went round to see [MASK].
APassageToIndia	56	20107	20089	20145	Aziz	The ball shot away towards a stray subaltern who was also practising; he hit it back to [MASK] and called, "Send it along again." "All right." The new-comer had some notion of what to do, but his horse had none, and forces were equal.
APassageToIndia	50	20168	20146	20196	Aziz	Concentrated on the ball, they somehow became fond of one another, and smiled when they drew rein to rest. [MASK] liked soldiers they either accepted you or swore at you, which was preferable to the civilian's hauteur and the subaltern liked anyone who could ride.
APassageToIndia	51	20289	20273	20324	Nationality	But it cooled with their bodies, for athletics can only raise a temporary glow. [MASK] was returning, but before it could exert its poison they parted, saluting each other. "If only they were all like that," each thought. Now it was sunset.
APassageToIndia	47	20644	20613	20660	Hassan	Would you have that? The cook is deaf I can never count on my cook and the boy is only a little boy. Never, never do I and [MASK] leave the house at the same time together. It is my fixed rule."
APassageToIndia	55	20726	20705	20760	Aziz	"Even if this so, what prevents leaving a chit saying where you go?" and so on. [MASK] detested ill breeding, and made his pony caper. "Farther away, or mine will start out of sympathy," he wailed, revealing the true source of his irritation.
APassageToIndia	50	20928	20879	20929	Dapple	" "It is fine to be young. Damn well! Oh, very fine. Damn whom?" "I go or not as I please." "Yet you promise me, and then fabricate this tale of a telegram. Go forward, [MASK].
APassageToIndia	50	21003	20973	21023	Hamidullah	The glory of his play with the subaltern remained for a little, he galloped and swooped till he poured with sweat, and until he returned the pony to [MASK]'s stable he felt the equal of any man. Once on his feet, he had creeping fears.
APassageToIndia	51	21238	21229	21280	Fielding	But this invitation gave him particular joy, because [MASK] had asked him to tea a month ago, and he had forgotten about it never answered, never gone, just forgotten. And here came a second invitation, without a rebuke or even an allusion to his slip.
APassageToIndia	49	21310	21263	21312	Hamidullah	And here came a second invitation, without a rebuke or even an allusion to his slip. Here was true courtesy the civil deed that shows the good heart and snatching up his pen he wrote an affectionate reply, and hurried back for news to [MASK]'s.
APassageToIndia	58	21654	21597	21655	Indians	By now he was a hard-bitten, good-tempered, intelligent fellow on the verge of middle age, with a belief in education. He did not mind whom he taught; public schoolboys, mental defectives and policemen, had all come his way, and he had no objection to adding [MASK].
APassageToIndia	53	22287	22241	22294	Indians	It just was so, and one had to choose. Most Englishmen preferred their own kinswomen, who, coming out in increasing numbers, made life on the home pattern yearly more possible. He had found it convenient and pleasant to associate with [MASK] and he must pay the price.
APassageToIndia	47	22442	22402	22449	Aziz	Lifting up his voice, he shouted from the bedroom, "Please make yourself at home." The remark was unpremeditated, like most of his actions; it was what he felt inclined to say. To [MASK] it had a very definite meaning.
APassageToIndia	48	22793	22773	22821	Fielding	That will be a kind of game." "You're five feet nine inches high," said [MASK], surmising this much through the ground glass of the bedroom door. "Jolly good. What next? Have I not a venerable white beard?
APassageToIndia	51	22985	22960	23011	Fielding	" "One minute again." Replacing his collar, he prayed that it would not spring up at the back during tea. [MASK]'s bearer, who was helping him to dress, opened the door for him. "Many thanks." They shook hands smiling.
APassageToIndia	47	23056	23038	23085	Aziz	With so emotional a people it was apt to come at once or never, and he and [MASK], having heard only good of each other, could afford to dispense with preliminaries. "But I always thought that Englishmen kept their rooms so tidy.
APassageToIndia	54	23184	23160	23214	Fielding	" "What's that last sentence, please? Will you teach me some new words and so improve my English?" [MASK] doubted whether "everything ranged coldly on shelves" could be improved. He was often struck with the liveliness with which the younger generation handled a foreign tongue.
APassageToIndia	50	23335	23300	23350	Fielding	I see . . . the shirt back's hole is rather small and to rip it wider a pity." "Why in hell does one wear collars at all?" grumbled [MASK] as he bent his neck. "We wear them to pass the Police.
APassageToIndia	48	23629	23613	23661	Aziz	Come along to tea. This world is getting too much for me altogether." [MASK] was offended. The remark suggested that he, an obscure Indian, had no right to have heard of Post Impressionism a privilege reserved for the Ruling Race, that.
APassageToIndia	45	24385	24359	24404	Fielding	It has never come. We waited and waited and waited; we can't think what happened." "Some misunderstanding," said [MASK], seeing at once that it was the type of incident that had better not be cleared up.
APassageToIndia	49	24613	24571	24620	Adela	I think for my own part they grew ashamed of their house and that is why they did not send." "That's a notion," said the other man. "I do so hate mysteries," [MASK] announced. "We English do.
APassageToIndia	50	24840	24840	24890	Aziz	[MASK] thought of his bungalow with horror. It was a detestable shanty near a low bazaar. There was practically only one room in it, and that infested with small black flies. "Oh, but we will talk of something else now," he exclaimed.
APassageToIndia	51	25895	25854	25905	Wings	She supposed him to be emancipated as well as reliable, and placed him on a pinnacle which he could not retain. He was high enough for the moment, to be sure, but not on any pinnacle. [MASK] bore him up, and flagging would deposit him.
APassageToIndia	54	26305	26252	26306	Ronny	To her, as to the three men, it seemed in key with the rest of the conversation, and not for several minutes indeed, not for half an hour did she realize that it was an important remark, and ought to have been made in the first place to [MASK].
APassageToIndia	51	26517	26517	26568	Aziz	[MASK] hesitated. His audience was splitting up. The more familiar half was going, but the more attentive remained. Reflecting that it was an "unconventional" afternoon, he stopped. Talk went on as before. Could one offer the visitors unripe mangoes in a fool?
APassageToIndia	46	26894	26888	26934	Aziz	What are these caves?" [MASK] undertook to explain, but it presently appeared that he had never visited the caves himself had always been "meaning" to go, but work or private business had prevented him, and they were so far.
APassageToIndia	44	27024	27013	27057	Aziz	Taking the cigarette box, she offered to him and to [MASK], and lit up herself. After an impressive pause he said: "There is an entrance in the rock which you enter, and through the entrance is the cave.
APassageToIndia	52	27105	27093	27145	Aziz	" "They are immensely holy, no doubt," said [MASK], to help on the narrative. "Oh no, oh no." "Still, they are ornamented in some way." "Oh no." "Well, why are they so famous?
APassageToIndia	48	27199	27162	27210	Aziz	" "No, I should not quite say that." "Describe them to this lady, then." "It will be a great pleasure." He forewent the pleasure, and [MASK] realized that he was keeping back something about the caves.
APassageToIndia	45	27452	27409	27454	Ronny	On he chattered, defeated at every move by an opponent who would not even admit that a move had been made, and further than ever from discovering what, if anything, was extraordinary about the Marabar Caves. Into this [MASK] dropped.
APassageToIndia	52	27476	27455	27507	Fielding	With an annoyance he took no trouble to conceal, he called from the garden: "What's happened to [MASK]? Where's my mother?" "Good evening!" she replied coolly. "I want you and mother at once. There's to be polo.
APassageToIndia	52	27658	27614	27666	Aziz	He did not mean to be rude to the two men, but the only link he could be conscious of with an Indian was the official, and neither happened to be his subordinate. As private individuals he forgot them. Unfortunately [MASK] was in no mood to be forgotten.
APassageToIndia	52	28043	28031	28083	Fielding	" "I'm sorry, what's up?" replied [MASK], also trying to be genial. "Well . . . I'm the sun-dried bureaucrat, no doubt; still, I don't like to see an English girl left smoking with two Indians.
APassageToIndia	46	28166	28157	28203	Fielding	"He isn't a bounder," protested [MASK]. "His nerves are on edge, that's all." "What should have upset his precious nerves?" "I don't know. He was all right when I left.
APassageToIndia	50	28217	28196	28246	Ronny	He was all right when I left." "Well, it's nothing I've said," said [MASK] reassuringly. "I never even spoke to him." "Oh well, come along now, and take your ladies away; the catastrophe over.
APassageToIndia	50	28249	28220	28270	Fielding	"I never even spoke to him." "Oh well, come along now, and take your ladies away; the catastrophe over." "[MASK] . . . don't think I'm taking it badly, or anything of that sort. . . .
APassageToIndia	51	28363	28315	28366	Fielding	I didn't mean to be." So the leave-taking began. Every one was cross or wretched. It was as if irritation exuded from the very soil. Could one have been so petty on a Scotch moor or an Italian alp? [MASK] wondered afterwards.
APassageToIndia	51	28793	28756	28807	Fielding	The sounds continued and ceased after a few moments as casually as they had begun apparently half through a bar, and upon the subdominant. "Thanks so much: what was that?" asked [MASK]. "I will explain in detail. It was a religious song.
APassageToIndia	41	28942	28931	28972	Godbole	"Oh no, he refuses to come," repeated [MASK], perhaps not understanding her question. "I say to Him, Come, come, come, come, come, come. He neglects to come.
APassageToIndia	49	28974	28950	28999	Ronny	"I say to Him, Come, come, come, come, come, come. He neglects to come." [MASK]'s steps had died away, and there was a moment of absolute silence. No ripple disturbed the water, no leaf stirred.
APassageToIndia	55	29476	29469	29524	Ronny	" "Out where?" asked [MASK]. "The Marabar Caves." "Well, I'm blessed," he murmured after a pause. "Did he descend to any details?" "He did not. If you had spoken to him, we could have arranged them.
APassageToIndia	48	29572	29566	29614	Aziz	" "So I am. [MASK] was exquisitely dressed, from tie-pin to spats, but he had forgotten his back collar-stud, and there you have the Indian all over: inattention to detail; the fundamental slackness that reveals the race.
APassageToIndia	51	29734	29698	29749	Adela	"Certainly not to this polo. Will you drive up to the bungalow first, and drop me there, please? I prefer to rest." "Drop me too," said [MASK]. "I don't want to watch polo either, I'm sure.
APassageToIndia	48	29790	29762	29810	Indians	Tired and disappointed, he quite lost self-control, and added in a loud lecturing voice, "I won't have you messing about with [MASK] any more! If you want to go to the Marabar Caves, you'll go under British auspices.
APassageToIndia	59	29975	29968	30027	Ronny	Which meant that she wouldn't marry [MASK]: but what a way to announce it, what a way for a civilized girl to behave! She owed him an explanation, but unfortunately there was nothing to explain. The "thorough talk" so dear to her principles and temperament had been postponed until too late.
APassageToIndia	47	30131	30089	30136	Ronny	They walked away from the governing group to a distant seat, and there, feeling that it was his due and her own, she forced out of herself the undigested remark: "We must have a thorough talk, [MASK], I'm afraid.
APassageToIndia	51	30212	30193	30244	Aziz	" "It's nothing to do with them that I . . ." "No, but [MASK] would make some similar muddle over the caves. He meant nothing by the invitation, I could tell by his voice; it's just their way of being pleasant.
APassageToIndia	55	30297	30245	30300	Ronny	" "It's something very different, nothing to do with caves, that I wanted to talk over with you." She gazed at the colourless grass. "I've finally decided we are not going to be married, my dear boy." The news hurt [MASK] very much.
APassageToIndia	54	30544	30499	30553	Mohurram	I want next to hear your point of view about me it might help us both." His manner was unhappy and reserved. "I don't much believe in this discussing besides, I'm so dead with all this extra work [MASK]'s bringing, if you'll excuse me.
APassageToIndia	46	30833	30825	30871	Ronny	" "Anyhow we've not quarrelled, [MASK]." "Oh, that would have been too absurd. Why should we quarrel?" "I think we shall keep friends." "I know we shall." "Quite so.
APassageToIndia	47	31060	31022	31069	Ronny	"Do you know what the name of that green bird up above us is?" she asked, putting her shoulder rather nearer to his. "Bee-eater." "Oh no, [MASK], it has red bars on its wings.
APassageToIndia	48	31072	31070	31118	Parrot	" "[MASK]," he hazarded. "Good gracious no." The bird in question dived into the dome of the tree. It was of no importance, yet they would have liked to identify it, it would somehow have solaced their hearts.
APassageToIndia	52	31144	31143	31195	McBryde	"[MASK] has an illustrated bird book," he said dejectedly. "I'm no good at all at birds, in fact I'm useless at any information outside my own job. It's a great pity." "So am I. I'm useless at everything.
APassageToIndia	53	31295	31277	31330	Adela	"I have, sahib, I have." "How do you do?" said [MASK], likewise pulling herself together. She held out her hand. The old gentleman judged from so wanton a gesture that she was new to his country, but he paid little heed.
APassageToIndia	48	31463	31459	31507	Adela	So he said to [MASK], with the same sad friendliness that he had employed when discussing the bird, "Would half an hour's spin entertain you at all?" "Oughtn't we to get back to the bungalow." "Why?"
APassageToIndia	53	31964	31964	32017	Ronny	[MASK]'s face grew dim an event that always increased her esteem for his character. Her hand touched his, owing to a jolt, and one of the thrills so frequent in the animal kingdom passed between them, and announced that all their difficulties were only a lovers' quarrel.
APassageToIndia	48	32242	32196	32244	Adela	The Eurasian, inclined to be flustered, rallied to the sound of his voice, and, every inch an Englishman, replied, "You give me five minutes' time, I'll take you any dam anywhere." "Frightened, [MASK]?"
APassageToIndia	54	32291	32276	32330	Ronny	"Well, it's all over now, tears are useless," said [MASK], dismounting. "We had some luck butting that tree." "All over . . . oh yes, the danger is past, let us smoke cigarettes, let us do anything we please.
APassageToIndia	51	32371	32346	32397	Adela	His words died into Arabic again. "Wasn't the bridge. We skidded." "We didn't skid," said [MASK], who had seen the cause of the accident, and thought everyone must have seen it too. "We ran into an animal.
APassageToIndia	49	32459	32456	32505	Jove	" "By [MASK], sir, your lady is right," echoed the Eurasian. Just by the hinges of the door was a dent, and the door opened with difficulty. "Of course I'm right. I saw its hairy back quite plainly.
APassageToIndia	48	32511	32506	32554	Adela	" "I say, [MASK], what was it?" "I don't know the animals any better than the birds here too big for a goat." "Exactly, too big for a goat . . ." said the old man.
APassageToIndia	46	32555	32537	32583	Ronny	" "Exactly, too big for a goat . . ." said the old man. [MASK] said, "Let's go into this; let's look for its tracks." "Exactly; you wish to borrow this electric torch.
APassageToIndia	54	32719	32717	32771	Adela	Moreover, [MASK] in her excitement knelt and swept her skirts about, until it was she if anyone who appeared to have attacked the car. The incident was a great relief to them both. They forgot their abortive personal relationship, and felt adventurous as they muddled about in the dust.
APassageToIndia	56	32805	32754	32810	Ronny	They forgot their abortive personal relationship, and felt adventurous as they muddled about in the dust. "I believe it was a buffalo," she called to their host, who had not accompanied them. "Exactly." "Unless it was a hyena." [MASK] approved this last conjecture.
APassageToIndia	56	32970	32955	33011	Ronny	Seeming to pull himself together, he apologized slowly and elaborately for the accident. [MASK] murmured, "Not at all," but apologies were his due, and should have started sooner: because English people are so calm at a crisis, it is not to be assumed that they are unimportant.
APassageToIndia	43	33034	33022	33065	Ronny	At that moment a large car approached from the opposite direction. [MASK] advanced a few steps down the road, and with authority in his voice and gesture stopped it. It bore the inscription "Mudkul State" across its bonnet.
APassageToIndia	42	33357	33355	33397	Nussu	" "[MASK] will bring you out some suitable dinner upon a bicycle," said the Nawab Bahadur, who had regained his usual dignity. "I shall despatch him with all possible speed. Meanwhile, repair my car.
APassageToIndia	50	33676	33662	33712	Ronny	I meant it to stop on the train. Oh lor'!" [MASK] laughed with restraint. He did not approve of English people taking service under the Native States, where they obtain a certain amount of influence, but at the expense of the general prestige.
APassageToIndia	52	33738	33713	33765	Indians	The humorous triumphs of a free lance are of no assistance to an administrator, and he told the young lady that she would outdo [MASK] at their own game if she went on much longer. "They always sack me before that happens, and then I get another job.
APassageToIndia	50	34085	34050	34100	Mudkul	"Oh, it is the duty of each and every citizen to shake superstition off, and though I have little experience of Hindu States, and none of this particular one, namely [MASK] (the Ruler, I fancy, has a salute of but eleven guns)
APassageToIndia	46	34892	34892	34938	Adela	[MASK]'s parents had also been happily married, and excellent it was to see the incident repeated by the younger generation. On and on! the number of such unions would certainly increase as education spread and ideals grew loftier, and characters firmer.
APassageToIndia	52	35011	35011	35063	Ronny	[MASK] was suited, now she must go home and help the others, if they wished. She was past marrying herself, even unhappily; her function was to help others, her reward to be informed that she was sympathetic. Elderly ladies must not expect more than this.
APassageToIndia	45	35088	35055	35100	Ronny	Elderly ladies must not expect more than this. They dined alone. There was much pleasant and affectionate talk about the future. Later on they spoke of passing events, and [MASK] reviewed and recounted the day from his own point of view.
APassageToIndia	43	35187	35154	35197	Heaven	One knew what happened next; the tower stuck, a Mohammedan climbed up the pepul and cut the branch off, the Hindus protested, there was a religious riot, and [MASK] knew what, with perhaps the troops sent for.
APassageToIndia	47	35338	35316	35363	Adela	His voice grew complacent again; he was here not to be pleasant but to keep the peace, and now that [MASK] had promised to be his wife, she was sure to understand. "What does our old gentleman of the car think?"
APassageToIndia	50	35416	35377	35427	Incredible	"Our old gentleman is helpful and sound, as he always is over public affairs. You've seen in him our show Indian." "Have I really?" "I'm afraid so. [MASK], aren't they, even the best of them?
APassageToIndia	51	35558	35522	35573	Adela	no great crimes, no great crimes, but no white man would have done it." "What animal?" "Oh, we had a small accident on the Marabar road. [MASK] thinks it was a hyena." "An accident?" she cried.
APassageToIndia	49	35754	35742	35791	Ronny	He had not turned up, and a terrific row ensued. [MASK] stormed, shouted, howled, and only the experienced observer could tell that he was not angry, did not much want the files, and only made a row because it was the custom.
APassageToIndia	56	35857	35842	35898	Adela	"Will you play Patience with your future mother-in-law, dear [MASK], or does it seem too tame?" "I should like to I don't feel a bit excited I'm just glad it's settled up at last, but I'm not conscious of vast changes.
APassageToIndia	58	36325	36297	36355	Indians	He sat behind his town house (a small unfurnished building which he rarely entered) in the midst of the little court that always improvises itself round [MASK] of position. As if turbans were the natural product of darkness a fresh one would occasionally froth to the front, incline itself towards him, and retire.
APassageToIndia	42	36632	36632	36674	Aziz	[MASK] continued: "Your grandfather belongs to another generation, and I respect and love the old gentleman, as you know. I say nothing against him, only that it is wrong for us, because we are young.
APassageToIndia	44	36719	36719	36763	Nureddin	[MASK] smiled, and a suitable answer rose to his pretty lips, but before he could make it the car arrived, and his grandfather took him away. The game of Patience up in the civil lines went on longer than this.
APassageToIndia	45	37454	37414	37459	Huzoor	The nucleus was a wire which had been inserted as a homage to electricity. Electricity had paid no attention, and a colony of eye-flies had come instead and blackened the coils with their bodies. "[MASK], those are flies.
APassageToIndia	45	37609	37583	37628	Hassan	"Good, very good. Now what have you to do?" "Kill flies." "Good. Do it." [MASK] withdrew, the plan almost lodged in his head, and began to look for the little boy.
APassageToIndia	49	37756	37713	37762	Europe	He had learnt all he needed concerning his own constitution many years ago, thanks to the social order into which he had been born, and when he came to study medicine he was repelled by the pedantry and fuss with which [MASK] tabulates the facts of sex.
APassageToIndia	56	38390	38387	38443	Rafi	Speak up, [MASK]." Less than the dust, the schoolboy murmured the word "Diarrh a," but took courage as soon as it had been uttered, for it improved his position. Flames of suspicion shot up again in the breasts of his elders, though in a different direction.
APassageToIndia	53	38477	38425	38478	March	Flames of suspicion shot up again in the breasts of his elders, though in a different direction. Could what was called diarrh a really be an early case of cholera? "If this is so, this is a very serious thing: this is scarcely the end of [MASK].
APassageToIndia	53	38522	38500	38553	Rafi	"Oh yes, both Hindus; there we have it; they hang together like flies and keep everything dark. [MASK], come here. Sit down. Tell me all the details. Is there vomiting also?" "Oh yes indeed, sir, and the serious pains.
APassageToIndia	48	38782	38757	38805	Aziz	His outburst took some time, and in his excitement he fell into Punjabi (he came from that side) and was unintelligible. [MASK] liked to hear his religion praised. It soothed the surface of his mind, and allowed beautiful images to form beneath.
APassageToIndia	56	38861	38806	38862	Ghalib	When the engineer's noisy tirade was finished, he said, "That is exactly my own view." He held up his hand, palm outward, his eyes began to glow, his heart to fill with tenderness. Issuing still farther from his quilt, he recited a poem by [MASK].
APassageToIndia	49	39138	39111	39160	Aziz	Yet they listened with pleasure, because literature had not been divorced from their civilization. The police inspector, for instance, did not feel that [MASK] had degraded himself by reciting, nor break into the cheery guffaw with which an Englishman averts the infection of beauty.
APassageToIndia	59	39255	39255	39314	Aziz	[MASK] it left thinking about women again, but in a different way: less definite, more intense. Sometimes poetry had this effect on him, sometimes it only increased his local desires, and he never knew beforehand which effect would ensue: he could discover no rule for this or for anything else in life.
APassageToIndia	42	39587	39557	39599	Aziz	Get well quickly, for I do not know what our little circle would do without you." "I shall not forget those affectionate words," replied [MASK]. "Add mine to them," said the engineer.
APassageToIndia	52	40245	40215	40267	Hamidullah	"Cholera, cholera, what next, what now?" cried the doctor, greatly fussed. "Who spreads such untrue reports about my patients?" [MASK] pointed to the culprit. "I hear cholera, I hear bubonic plague, I hear every species of lie.
APassageToIndia	50	40300	40268	40318	Rafi	Where will it end, I ask myself sometimes. This city is full of misstatements, and the originators of them ought to be discovered and punished authoritatively." "[MASK], do you hear that? Now why do you stuff us up with all this humbug?
APassageToIndia	41	40420	40414	40455	Rafi	"You must apologize properly, [MASK], I can see your uncle wishes it," he said. "You have not yet said that you are sorry for the trouble you have caused this gentleman by your carelessness.
APassageToIndia	51	40561	40543	40594	Hamidullah	" Their voices rose. They attacked one another with obscure allusions and had a silly quarrel. [MASK] and the doctor tried to make peace between them. In the midst of the din someone said, "I say! Is he ill or isn't he ill?"
APassageToIndia	48	40628	40628	40676	Aziz	[MASK] said, "Sit down," coldly. What a room! What a meeting! Squalor and ugly talk, the floor strewn with fragments of cane and nuts, and spotted with ink, the pictures crooked upon the dirty walls, no punkah!
APassageToIndia	58	40703	40677	40735	Rafi	He hadn't meant to live like this or among these third-rate people. And in his confusion he thought only of the insignificant [MASK], whom he had laughed at, and allowed to be teased. The boy must be sent away happy, or hospitality would have failed, along the whole line.
APassageToIndia	48	40800	40756	40804	Rafi	"We are touched by this great kindness." "Don't talk to him like that, he doesn't want it, and he doesn't want three chairs; he's not three Englishmen," he flashed. "[MASK], come here.
APassageToIndia	47	40966	40947	40994	Rafi	Please remain seated, if you will excuse the informality." He turned away and continued to address [MASK], who was terrified at the arrival of his Principal, remembered that he had tried to spread slander about him, and yearned to get away.
APassageToIndia	50	41028	41027	41077	Fielding	" [MASK] agreed; he and the pleasant sensitive barrister got on well. They were fairly intimate and beginning to trust each other. "The whole world looks to be dying, still it doesn't die, so we must assume the existence of a beneficent Providence.
APassageToIndia	58	41214	41214	41272	Hamidullah	[MASK] enquired. "The educated thoughtful people? I should say so, though they don't like the name. The truth is that the West doesn't bother much over belief and disbelief in these days. Fifty years ago, or even when you and I were young, much more fuss was made.
APassageToIndia	48	41407	41380	41428	Fielding	" "Well-qualified Indians also need jobs in the educational." "I guess they do; I got in first," said [MASK], smiling. "Then excuse me again is it fair an Englishman should occupy one when Indians are available?
APassageToIndia	47	41477	41476	41523	Fielding	Yet [MASK] was disinclined to give it. The zeal for honesty had eaten him up. He said, "I'm delighted to be here too that's my answer, there's my only excuse. I can't tell you anything about fairness.
APassageToIndia	42	41676	41638	41680	Hamidullah	What they said and what they felt were (except in the case of affection) seldom the same. They had numerous mental conventions and when these were flouted they found it very difficult to function. [MASK] bore up best.
APassageToIndia	46	42019	42004	42050	Fielding	" "Come along, we tire the invalid in either case," said [MASK], and they filed out four Mohammedans, two Hindus and the Englishman. They stood on the verandah while their conveyances were summoned out of various patches of shade.
APassageToIndia	44	42078	42070	42114	Fielding	" "I quite understand," said [MASK], who was rather disappointed with his call. The Club comment, "making himself cheap as usual," passed through his mind. He couldn't even get his horse brought up.
APassageToIndia	55	42118	42105	42160	Aziz	He couldn't even get his horse brought up. He had liked [MASK] so much at their first meeting, and had hoped for developments. CHAPTER X The heat had leapt forward in the last hour, the street was deserted as if a catastrophe had cleaned off humanity during the inconclusive talk.
APassageToIndia	42	42509	42509	42551	April	[MASK], herald of horrors, is at hand. The sun was returning to his kingdom with power but without beauty that was the sinister feature. If only there had been beauty! His cruelty would have been tolerable then.
APassageToIndia	56	42803	42801	42857	Callendar	" "[MASK] doesn't trust anyone, English or Indian: that's his character, and I wish you weren't under him; but you are, and that's that." "Before you go, for you are evidently in a great hurry, will you please unlock that drawer?
APassageToIndia	49	42987	42945	42994	Aziz	He tried to look at the photograph, but in itself it was just a woman in a sari, facing the world. He muttered, "Really, I don't know why you pay me this great compliment, [MASK], but I do appreciate it.
APassageToIndia	51	43074	43074	43125	Hamidullah	[MASK] saw her, and several others." "Did she think they were your brothers?" "Of course not, but the word exists and is convenient. All men are my brothers, and as soon as one behaves as such he may see my wife.
APassageToIndia	45	43169	43126	43171	Aziz	" "And when the whole world behaves as such, there will be no more purdah?" "It is because you can say and feel such a remark as that, that I show you the photograph," said [MASK] gravely.
APassageToIndia	52	43450	43400	43452	Aziz	He looked again at the photograph. The lady faced the world at her husband's wish and her own, but how bewildering she found it, the echoing contradictory world! "Put her away, she is of no importance, she is dead," said [MASK] gently.
APassageToIndia	54	43503	43467	43521	Fielding	You may look round the whole of my bungalow now, and empty everything. I have no other secrets, my three children live away with their grandmamma, and that is all." [MASK] sat down by the bed, flattered at the trust reposed in him, yet rather sad.
APassageToIndia	52	43546	43540	43592	Aziz	The next time they met, [MASK] might be cautious and standoffish. He realized this, and it made him sad that he should realize it. Kindness, kindness, and more kindness yes, that he might supply, but was that really all that the queer nation needed?
APassageToIndia	49	44116	44079	44128	Caring	" "It must." "Well." He shook his head. "This indifference is what the Oriental will never understand." "I don't care for children." "[MASK] has nothing to do with it," he said impatiently.
APassageToIndia	47	44329	44310	44357	Fielding	" "I thought her so nice and sincere." "So she probably is," said [MASK], ashamed of his roughness: any suggestion that he should marry always does produce overstatements on the part of the bachelor, and a mental breeze.
APassageToIndia	49	44929	44897	44946	Aziz	" "If I do, I do. I shall survive it. I travel light." "Travel light! You are a most extraordinary race," said [MASK], turning away as if he were going to sleep, and immediately turning back again.
APassageToIndia	54	44960	44947	45001	Indians	"Is it your climate, or what?" "Plenty of [MASK] travel light too saddhus and such. It's one of the things I admire about your country. Any man can travel light until he has a wife or children. That's part of my case against marriage.
APassageToIndia	52	45030	44993	45045	Aziz	That's part of my case against marriage. I'm a holy man minus the holiness. Hand that on to your three spies, and tell them to put it in their pipes." [MASK] was charmed and interested, and turned the new idea over in his mind.
APassageToIndia	50	45074	45066	45116	Islam	But he himself was rooted in society and [MASK]. He belonged to a tradition which bound him, and he had brought children into the world, the society of the future. Though he lived so vaguely in this flimsy bungalow, nevertheless he was placed, placed.
APassageToIndia	50	45221	45188	45238	Fielding	" He concluded his manifesto, and both were silent. The eye-flies became worse than ever and danced close up to their pupils, or crawled into their ears. [MASK] hit about wildly. The exercise made him hot, and he got up to go.
APassageToIndia	49	45372	45327	45376	Aziz	" "Do you promise to come at once to us when you are in trouble?" "I never can be in trouble." "There goes a queer chap, I trust he won't come to grief," thought [MASK], left alone.
APassageToIndia	44	45411	45390	45434	Fielding	It was difficult for him to remain in awe of anyone who played with all his cards on the table. [MASK], he discovered on closer acquaintance, was truly warm-hearted and unconventional, but not what can be called wise.
APassageToIndia	49	45995	45978	46027	Hinduism	To call them "uncanny" suggests ghosts, and they are older than all spirit. [MASK] has scratched and plastered a few rocks, but the shrines are unfrequented, as if pilgrims, who generally seek the extraordinary, had here found too much of it.
APassageToIndia	58	46865	46856	46914	Aziz	As the story travelled, it accreted emotion and [MASK] learnt with horror that the ladies were deeply offended with him, and had expected an invitation daily. He thought his facile remark had been forgotten. Endowed with two memories, a temporary and a permanent, he had hitherto relegated the caves to the former.
APassageToIndia	45	46978	46978	47023	Fielding	[MASK] didn't like the job much; he was busy, caves bored him, he foresaw friction and expense, but he would not refuse the first favour his friend had asked from him, and did as required. The ladies accepted.
APassageToIndia	53	47673	47642	47695	Aziz	" They replied that they should like it. The train had come in, and a crowd of dependents were swarming over the seats of the carriage like monkeys. [MASK] had borrowed servants from his friends, as well as bringing his own three, and quarrels over precedence were resulting.
APassageToIndia	50	47890	47872	47922	Much	They shrieked that the train was starting, and ran to both ends of it to intercede. [MASK] had still to enter the purdah carriage a box bound with brass, a melon wearing a fez, a towel containing guavas, a step-ladder and a gun.
APassageToIndia	50	48029	47996	48046	Antony	"Send back your servant," he suggested. "He is unnecessary. Then we shall all be Moslems together." "And he is such a horrible servant. [MASK], you can go; we don't want you," said the girl impatiently.
APassageToIndia	47	48525	48489	48536	Europeans	"Tell me another time, brother, when I have more leisure, for now, as I have already explained, we have to give pleasure to non-Moslems. Three will be [MASK], one a Hindu, which must not be forgotten.
APassageToIndia	43	48647	48647	48690	Aziz	[MASK] did likewise. It was an easy feat, for a branch-line train is slow to assume special airs. "We're monkeys, don't worry," he called, hanging on to a bar and laughing.
APassageToIndia	45	48780	48745	48790	Godbole	So near and yet so far! As the train joggled past over the points, there was time for agonized words. "Bad, bad, you have destroyed me." "[MASK]'s pujah did it," cried the Englishman.
APassageToIndia	54	49532	49530	49584	Adela	It was [MASK]'s faith that the whole stream of events is important and interesting, and if she grew bored she blamed herself severely and compelled her lips to utter enthusiasms. This was the only insincerity in a character otherwise sincere, and it was indeed the intellectual protest of her youth.
APassageToIndia	48	49904	49887	49935	Antony	She loved plans. "Very well, you get another servant, and I'll keep [MASK] with me. I am used to his unappetizing ways. He will see me through the Hot Weather." "I don't believe in the Hot Weather.
APassageToIndia	50	50574	50546	50596	Ronny	Her accident was a pleasant memory; she felt in her dry, honest way that it had given her a good shake up, and taught her [MASK]'s true worth. Then she went back to her plans; plans had been a passion with her from girlhood.
APassageToIndia	58	50612	50597	50655	Aziz	Now and then she paid tribute to the present, said how friendly and intelligent [MASK] was, ate a guava, couldn't eat a fried sweet, practised her Urdu on the servant; but her thoughts ever veered to the manageable future, and to the Anglo-Indian life she had decided to endure.
APassageToIndia	56	51555	51541	51597	Aziz	"Good morning, good morning, put on your topis," shouted [MASK] from farther down the train. "Put on your topis at once, the early sun is highly dangerous for heads. I speak as a doctor." "Good morning, good morning, put on your own.
APassageToIndia	50	51628	51579	51629	Adela	I speak as a doctor." "Good morning, good morning, put on your own." "Not for my thick head," he laughed, banging it and holding up pads of his hair. "Nice creature he is," murmured [MASK].
APassageToIndia	48	51738	51702	51750	Aziz	There was a platform too, but it shrivelled into insignificance. An elephant, waving her painted forehead at the morn! "Oh, what a surprise!" called the ladies politely. [MASK] said nothing, but he nearly burst with pride and relief.
APassageToIndia	52	51859	51845	51897	Aziz	That an elephant should depend from so long and so slender a string filled [MASK] with content, and with humorous appreciation of the East, where the friends of friends are a reality, where everything gets done sometime, and sooner or later every one gets his share of happiness.
APassageToIndia	42	51999	51969	52011	Aziz	"It takes an hour to get there, an hour to get back, and two hours for the caves, which we will call three," said [MASK], smiling charmingly. There was suddenly something regal about him.
APassageToIndia	49	52149	52120	52169	shikar	Then mount this wild animal." The elephant had knelt, grey and isolated, like another hill. They climbed up the ladder, and he mounted [MASK] fashion, treading first on the sharp edge of the heel and then into the looped-up tail.
APassageToIndia	47	52619	52614	52661	Ronny	But when she looked through [MASK]'s field-glasses, she found it wasn't a snake, but the withered and twisted stump of a toddy-palm. So she said, "It isn't a snake." The villagers contradicted her.
APassageToIndia	50	52678	52657	52707	Aziz	The villagers contradicted her. She had put the word into their minds, and they refused to abandon it. [MASK] admitted that it looked like a tree through the glasses, but insisted that it was a black cobra really, and improvised some rubbish about protective mimicry.
APassageToIndia	51	52901	52859	52910	Aziz	The sky dominated as usual, but seemed unhealthily near, adhering like a ceiling to the summits of the precipices. It was as if the contents of the corridor had never been changed. Occupied by his own munificence, [MASK] noticed nothing. His guests noticed a little.
APassageToIndia	56	53400	53365	53421	Aziz	Hospitality had been achieved, they were "his" guests; his honour was involved in their happiness, and any discomfort they endured would tear his own soul. Like most Orientals, [MASK] overrated hospitality, mistaking it for intimacy, and not seeing that it is tainted with the sense of possession.
APassageToIndia	49	53945	53933	53982	Babur	Oh yes, he was of course the more pious. But [MASK] never in his whole life did he betray a friend, so I can only think of him this morning. And you know how he died? He laid down his life for his son.
APassageToIndia	43	54146	54118	54161	Fielding	"We enjoy talk like this very much." For at last he was talking about what he knew and felt, talking as he had in [MASK]'s garden-house; he was again the Oriental guide whom they appreciated.
APassageToIndia	59	54693	54682	54741	Indians	"Some women are so well, ungenerous and snobby about [MASK], and I should feel too ashamed for words if I turned like them, but and here's my difficulty there's nothing special about me, nothing specially good or strong, which will help me to resist my environment and avoid becoming like them.
APassageToIndia	52	54753	54742	54794	Akbar	I've most lamentable defects. That's why I want [MASK]'s universal religion' or the equivalent to keep me decent and sensible. Do you see what I mean?" Her remarks pleased him, but his mind shut up tight because she had alluded to her marriage.
APassageToIndia	48	55682	55635	55683	Adela	Nothing evil had been in the cave, but she had not enjoyed herself; no, she had not enjoyed herself, and she decided not to visit a second one. "Did you see the reflection of his match rather pretty?" asked [MASK].
APassageToIndia	44	55817	55817	55861	Aziz	[MASK] came to help the guests over the rocks. He was at the summit of his powers, vigorous and humble, too sure of himself to resent criticism, and he was sincerely pleased when he heard they were altering his plans.
APassageToIndia	55	56662	56629	56684	Aziz	For a time she thought, "I am going to be ill," to comfort herself, then she surrendered to the vision. She lost all interest, even in [MASK], and the affectionate and sincere words that she had spoken to him seemed no longer hers but the air's.
APassageToIndia	44	56845	56845	56889	Aziz	[MASK] was "pretty sure they should come on some interesting old carvings soon," but only meant he wished there were some carvings. His deeper thoughts were about the breakfast. Symptoms of disorganization had appeared as he left the camp.
APassageToIndia	51	57217	57207	57258	Aziz	"Do I take you too fast?" enquired [MASK], for she had paused, a doubtful expression on her face. The discovery had come so suddenly that she felt like a mountaineer whose rope had broken. Not to love the man one's going to marry!
APassageToIndia	59	57402	57369	57428	Aziz	"No, I'm all right, thanks," she said, and, her emotions well under control, resumed the climb, though she felt a bit dashed. [MASK] held her hand, the guide adhered to the surface like a lizard and scampered about as if governed by a personal centre of gravity.
APassageToIndia	46	57613	57571	57617	Ronny	She did not admire him with any personal warmth, for there was nothing of the vagrant in her blood, but she guessed he might attract women of his own race and rank, and she regretted that neither she nor [MASK] had physical charm.
APassageToIndia	41	57950	57921	57962	Aziz	When he returned, he found the guide, alone, with his head on one side. He had heard a noise, he said, and then [MASK] heard it too: the noise of a motor-car.
APassageToIndia	51	58121	58105	58156	Aziz	"You should have kept her in sight, it was your duty," said [MASK] severely. "Here are twelve caves at least. How am I to know which contains my guest? Which is the cave I was in myself?" The same vague gesture.
APassageToIndia	51	58158	58124	58175	Aziz	"Here are twelve caves at least. How am I to know which contains my guest? Which is the cave I was in myself?" The same vague gesture. And [MASK], looking again, could not even be sure he had returned to the same group.
APassageToIndia	49	58258	58222	58271	Aziz	"Shout!" he commanded. When they had done this for awhile, the guide explained that to shout is useless, because a Marabar cave can hear no sound but its own. [MASK] wiped his head, and sweat began to stream inside his clothes.
APassageToIndia	49	58702	58701	58750	Fielding	"[MASK]! Oh, I have so wanted you!" he cried, dropping the "Mr." for the first time. And his friend ran to meet him, all so pleasant and jolly, no dignity, shouting explanations and apologies about the train.
APassageToIndia	54	59275	59232	59286	Fielding	He would prefer to give breakfast to all four; still, guests must do as they wish, or they become prisoners. He went away cheerfully to inspect the porridge and the ice. "What's happened?" asked [MASK], who felt at once that something had gone queer.
APassageToIndia	56	59527	59526	59582	Aziz	"[MASK] is a charming fellow," he announced. "I know," she answered, with a yawn. "He has taken endless trouble to make a success of our picnic." They knew one another very little, and felt rather awkward at being drawn together by an Indian.
APassageToIndia	59	59617	59563	59622	Aziz	" They knew one another very little, and felt rather awkward at being drawn together by an Indian. The racial problem can take subtle forms. In their case it had induced a sort of jealousy, a mutual suspicion. He tried to goad her enthusiasm; she scarcely spoke. [MASK] fetched them to breakfast.
APassageToIndia	45	59932	59932	59977	Fielding	[MASK] ran up to see one cave. He wasn't impressed. Then they got on the elephant and the picnic began to unwind out of the corridor and escaped under the precipice towards the railway station, pursued by stabs of hot air.
APassageToIndia	47	60091	60061	60108	Fielding	" "Oh, rather, most helpful." "Is there a path off the top?" "Millions of paths, my dear fellow." [MASK] could see nothing but the crease. Everywhere else the glaring granite plunged into the earth.
APassageToIndia	44	60287	60248	60292	Fielding	I see you are worrying on my account, but really I don't mind, I never notice trifles." "I do worry on your account. I consider they have been impolite!" said [MASK], lowering his voice.
APassageToIndia	49	60547	60534	60583	initials	I can trust you not to repeat this. And M.L. please employ [MASK], he listens is far the worst of all." "I told you he's no good." "He is plenty of good for himself; his dishonesty will ruin me.
APassageToIndia	51	60586	60584	60635	Aziz	" "[MASK], how monstrous!" "I am delighted with him really, he has made my guests comfortable; besides, it is my duty to employ him, he is my cousin. If money goes, money comes. If money stays, death comes.
APassageToIndia	51	61306	61276	61327	McBryde	A second later, and he would have been out, whistles blowing, a man-hunt. . . . "Dear fellow, we're coming to [MASK] together, and enquire what's gone wrong he's a decent fellow, it's all unintentional . . .
APassageToIndia	41	61502	61501	61542	Fielding	When [MASK] entered the doors clapped to, and were guarded by a servant, while a punkah, to mark the importance of the moment, flapped dirty petticoats over their heads. The Collector could not speak at first.
APassageToIndia	52	61718	61679	61731	Turton	" He nodded. "Absolutely impossible, grotesque." "I called you to preserve you from the odium that would attach to you if you were seen accompanying him to the Police Station," said [MASK], paying no attention to his protest, indeed scarcely hearing it.
APassageToIndia	48	62035	61998	62046	Fielding	" He slammed his hand on the table. "That that is a repetition of your insult in an aggravated form." "If I may venture to say so, no," said [MASK], also going white, but sticking to his point.
APassageToIndia	53	62068	62047	62100	Aziz	"I make no reflection on the good faith of the two ladies, but the charge they are bringing against [MASK] rests upon some mistake, and five minutes will clear it up. The man's manner is perfectly natural; besides, I know him to be incapable of infamy.
APassageToIndia	49	62786	62786	62835	Hassan	[MASK] flung off his turban, and wept. All the comforts that had been provided so liberally were rolled about and wasted in the sun. The Collector took in the situation at a glance, and his sense of justice functioned though he was insane with rage.
APassageToIndia	43	63622	63590	63633	Fielding	Well. She climbed up a sort of gully to her, and found her practically done for her helmet off " "Was a guide not with her?" interrupted [MASK]. "No. She had got among some cactuses.
APassageToIndia	51	64052	64041	64092	Fielding	Am I not being beastly? But, you see, [MASK], as I've said to you once before, you're a schoolmaster, and consequently you come across these people at their best. That's what puts you wrong. They can be charming as boys.
APassageToIndia	52	64120	64086	64138	Aziz	They can be charming as boys. But I know them as they really are, after they have developed into men. Look at this, for instance." He held up [MASK]' pocket-case. "I am going through the contents. They are not edifying.
APassageToIndia	46	64428	64401	64447	Callendar	It'll cost you nothing." "It's no use ringing up them," he replied, stretching out for the telephone. "[MASK] settles a question like that, of course. You haven't grasped that she's seriously ill.
APassageToIndia	53	64504	64469	64522	Aziz	The expected answer came back: the Major would not hear of the patient being troubled. "I only wanted to ask her whether she is certain, dead certain, that it was [MASK] who followed her into the cave." "Possibly my wife might ask her that much.
APassageToIndia	51	64562	64512	64563	Indians	" "Possibly my wife might ask her that much." "But _I_ wanted to ask her. I want someone who believes in him to ask her." "What difference does that make?" "She is among people who disbelieve in [MASK].
APassageToIndia	45	64652	64615	64660	Hamidullah	I'm sorry to say he gave a bad account just now. He says that she is by no means out of danger." They were silent. Another card was brought into the office [MASK]'s. The opposite army was gathering.
APassageToIndia	49	64670	64661	64710	Fielding	"I must put this report through now, [MASK]." "I wish you wouldn't." "How can I not?" "I feel that things are rather unsatisfactory as well as most disastrous. We are heading for a most awful smash.
APassageToIndia	50	64867	64827	64877	Turton	"One's got to breathe occasionally, at least I have. I mayn't see her, and now I mayn't see him. I promised him to come up here with him to you, but [MASK] called me off before I could get two steps.
APassageToIndia	50	65098	65058	65108	Aziz	If you leave the line, you leave a gap in the line. These jackals" he pointed at the lawyers' cards "are looking with all their eyes for a gap." "Can I visit [MASK]?" was his answer. "No."
APassageToIndia	47	65114	65105	65152	Turton	"No." Now that he knew of [MASK]'s attitude, the policeman had no doubts. "You may see him on a magistrate's order, but on my own responsibility I don't feel justified. It might lead to more complications.
APassageToIndia	50	65288	65274	65324	McBryde	"How do you know that?" "He told me." [MASK] gave a faint, incredulous smile, and started rummaging in the drawer. His face became inquisitive and slightly bestial. "Wife indeed, I know those wives!" he was thinking.
APassageToIndia	43	65841	65841	65884	McBryde	[MASK]'s remark, "If you leave the line, you leave a gap in the line," was being illustrated. "First and foremost, the question of bail . . ." Application must be made this afternoon.
APassageToIndia	45	65968	65945	65990	Amritrao	He mentioned one or two names men from a distance who would not be intimidated by local conditions and said he should prefer [MASK], a Calcutta barrister, who had a high reputation professionally and personally, but who was notoriously anti-British.
APassageToIndia	49	66071	66046	66095	Amritrao	When I saw my friend's private papers carried in just now in the arms of a dirty policeman, I said to myself, [MASK] is the man to clear up this.'" There was a lugubrious pause. The temple bell continued to jangle harshly.
APassageToIndia	53	66114	66081	66134	Dominion	" There was a lugubrious pause. The temple bell continued to jangle harshly. The interminable and disastrous day had scarcely reached its afternoon. Continuing their work, the wheels of [MASK] now propelled a messenger on a horse from the Superintendent to the Magistrate with an official report of arrest.
APassageToIndia	48	66148	66135	66183	Fielding	"Don't complicate, let the cards play themselves," entreated [MASK], as he watched the man disappear into dust. "We're bound to win, there's nothing else we can do. She will never be able to substantiate the charge.
APassageToIndia	52	66228	66227	66279	Aziz	Give [MASK] my love when you see him, and tell him to keep calm, calm, calm. I shall go back to the College now. If you want me, ring me up; if you don't, don't, for I shall be very busy.
APassageToIndia	49	66288	66256	66305	Fielding	If you want me, ring me up; if you don't, don't, for I shall be very busy." "Good-bye, my dear [MASK], and you actually are on our side against your own people?" "Yes.
APassageToIndia	52	66676	66637	66689	Aziz	I hope the expedition was a successful one." "The news has not reached you yet, I can see." "Oh yes." "No; there has been a terrible catastrophe about [MASK]." "Oh yes. That is all round the College.
APassageToIndia	48	66709	66678	66726	Fielding	" "Oh yes. That is all round the College." "Well, the expedition where that occurs can scarcely be called a successful one," said [MASK], with an amazed stare. "I cannot say. I was not present.
APassageToIndia	46	67155	67139	67185	Aziz	The old fellow put his hands together, and looked sly and charming. "Is [MASK] innocent or guilty?" "That is for the Court to decide. The verdict will be in strict accordance with the evidence, I make no doubt.
APassageToIndia	48	67932	67895	67943	Fielding	And in the same breath, as if to cancel any beauty his words might have contained, he added, "But did you have time to visit any of the interesting Marabar antiquities?" [MASK] was silent, trying to meditate and rest his brain.
APassageToIndia	54	68924	68905	68959	Fielding	The Collector clapped his hands for silence. He was much calmer than when he had flown out at [MASK]. He was indeed always calmer when he addressed several people than in a _t te- -t te._ "I want to talk specially to the ladies," he said.
APassageToIndia	50	69004	68998	69048	Harry	That's all." "[MASK], is there any news from the city?" asked his wife, standing at some distance from him, and also assuming her public-safety voice. The rest were silent during the august colloquy. "Everything absolutely normal.
APassageToIndia	50	69061	69015	69065	Mohurram	asked his wife, standing at some distance from him, and also assuming her public-safety voice. The rest were silent during the august colloquy. "Everything absolutely normal." "I had gathered as much. Those drums are merely [MASK], of course.
APassageToIndia	50	70144	70111	70161	Heaven	I want everything to go on precisely as usual, until there's cause for the contrary. Get the womenfolk off to the hills, but do it quietly, and for [MASK]'s sake no more talk of special trains. Never mind what you think or feel.
APassageToIndia	49	70170	70168	70217	Indian	One isolated [MASK] has attempted is charged with an attempted crime." He flipped his forehead hard with his finger-nail, and they all realized that he felt as deeply as they did, and they loved him, and determined not to increase his difficulties.
APassageToIndia	59	70290	70290	70349	Lesley	[MASK]! You remember the one I had a knock with on your Maidan last month. Well, he was all right. Any native who plays polo is all right. What you've got to stamp on is these educated classes, and, mind, I do know what I'm talking about this time.
APassageToIndia	50	70421	70415	70465	Fielding	He surveyed the company, saw [MASK] crouched below him on an ottoman, and said, "H'm!" Everyone began pressing him for details. "No one's out of danger in this country as long as they have a temperature," was his answer.
APassageToIndia	49	70495	70491	70540	Callendar	"Squat down, [MASK]; tell us all about it." "Take me some time to do that." "How's the old lady?" "Temperature." "My wife heard she was sinking." "So she may be.
APassageToIndia	49	70554	70513	70562	Lesley	" "How's the old lady?" "Temperature." "My wife heard she was sinking." "So she may be. I guarantee nothing. I really can't be plagued with questions, [MASK]." "Sorry, old man.
APassageToIndia	50	70719	70681	70731	Fielding	To feel I'm responsible, that's what hits me. To refuse, and then give in under pressure. That is what I did, my sons, that is what I did." [MASK] took his pipe from his mouth and looked at it thoughtfully.
APassageToIndia	50	70768	70752	70802	Callendar	That is why I gave in." "No one blames you, my dear [MASK]," said the Collector, looking down. "We are all to blame in the sense that we ought to have seen the expedition was insufficiently guaranteed, and stopped it.
APassageToIndia	58	70880	70823	70881	Fielding	We are all implicated in that sense, but not an atom of blame attaches to you personally." "I don't feel that. I wish I could. Responsibility is a very awful thing, and I've no use for the man who shirks it." His eyes were directed on [MASK].
APassageToIndia	47	71104	71092	71139	Fielding	How did they get rid of him? Money again." [MASK] rose to his feet, supported by murmurs and exclamations, for no one yet suspected his integrity. "Oh, I'm being misunderstood, apologies," said the Major offensively.
APassageToIndia	59	71169	71150	71209	Godbole	" "Then what do you mean?" "They paid the other Indian to make you late [MASK]. He was saying his prayers. I know those prayers!" "That's ridiculous . . ." He sat down again, trembling with rage; person after person was being dragged into the mud.
APassageToIndia	48	71222	71182	71230	Heaslop	" "That's ridiculous . . ." He sat down again, trembling with rage; person after person was being dragged into the mud. Having shot this bolt, the Major prepared the next. "[MASK] also found out something from his mother.
APassageToIndia	53	71299	71299	71352	Pretty	[MASK]." His voice broke into a roar. "It's not the time for sitting down. It's the time for action. Call in the troops and clear the bazaars." The Major's outbursts were always discounted, but he made everyone uneasy on this occasion.
APassageToIndia	52	71479	71472	71524	Lesley	"Why should it?" responded [MASK]. "Oh, nothing. I only heard a rumour that a certain member here present has been seeing the prisoner this afternoon. You can't run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, at least not in this country.
APassageToIndia	53	71535	71505	71558	Fielding	You can't run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, at least not in this country." "Does anyone here present want to?" [MASK] was determined not to be drawn again. He had something to say, but it should be at his own moment.
APassageToIndia	51	71596	71559	71610	Ronny	The attack failed to mature, because the Collector did not support it. Attention shifted from him for a time. Then the buzz of women broke out again. The door had been opened by [MASK]. The young man looked exhausted and tragic, also gentler than usual.
APassageToIndia	54	71677	71677	71731	Fielding	[MASK] realized this, and he remained seated. It was an ungracious, a caddish thing to do, perhaps an unsound thing to do, but he felt he had been passive long enough, and that he might be drawn into the wrong current if he did not make a stand.
APassageToIndia	54	71765	71763	71817	Heaslop	" "[MASK], I'm telling them I'm against any show of force," said the Collector apologetically. "I don't know whether you will feel as I do, but that is how I am situated. When the verdict is obtained, it will be another matter.
APassageToIndia	53	71925	71924	71977	Callendar	" [MASK] laughed with friendly inwardness, and said, "Heaslop, Heaslop, next time bail's wanted, ring up the old doctor before giving it; his shoulders are broad, and, speaking in the strictest confidence, don't take the old doctor's opinion too seriously.
APassageToIndia	57	72067	72061	72118	Fielding	It was the attack for which [MASK] had waited, and to which he must reply. "May I make a statement, sir?" "Certainly." Seasoned and self-contained, devoid of the fervours of nationality or youth, the schoolmaster did what was for him a comparatively easy thing.
APassageToIndia	50	72292	72247	72297	Fielding	" "With all deference, sir, I am not here to answer questions, but to make a personal statement, and I have concluded it." "May I ask whether you have taken over charge of this District?" [MASK] moved towards the door.
APassageToIndia	53	72443	72400	72453	Fielding	You have sunk to the level of your associates; you are weak, weak, that is what is wrong with you " "I want to leave the room, but cannot while this gentleman prevents me," said [MASK] lightly; the subaltern had got across his path.
APassageToIndia	46	72497	72486	72532	Fielding	There was a slight scuffle at the door, from which [MASK] was propelled, a little more quickly than is natural, into the room where the ladies were playing cards. "Fancy if I'd fallen or got angry," he thought.
APassageToIndia	45	72555	72519	72564	Heaslop	"Fancy if I'd fallen or got angry," he thought. Of course he was a little angry. His peers had never offered him violence or called him weak before, besides [MASK] had heaped coals of fire on his head.
APassageToIndia	52	73078	73044	73096	Mohurram	At the entrance of the bazaars, a tiger made his horse shy a youth dressed up as a tiger, the body striped brown and yellow, a mask over the face. [MASK] was working up. The city beat a good many drums, but seemed good-tempered.
APassageToIndia	48	73891	73854	73902	Ronny	There was "the shock," but what is that? For a time her own logic would convince her, then she would hear the echo again, weep, declare she was unworthy of [MASK], and hope her assailant would get the maximum penalty.
APassageToIndia	58	74002	73986	74044	Ronny	The old lady had not been well either, and was disinclined to come out, [MASK] reported. And consequently the echo flourished, raging up and down like a nerve in the faculty of her hearing, and the noise in the cave, so unimportant intellectually, was prolonged over the surface of her life.
APassageToIndia	48	74139	74124	74172	Adela	she could even hear it entering the lives of others. . . . And [MASK] spent days in this atmosphere of grief and depression. Her friends kept up their spirits by demanding holocausts of natives, but she was too worried and weak to do that.
APassageToIndia	45	74189	74150	74195	Ronny	Her friends kept up their spirits by demanding holocausts of natives, but she was too worried and weak to do that. When the cactus thorns had all been extracted, and her temperature fallen to normal, [MASK] came to fetch her away.
APassageToIndia	50	74328	74328	74378	McBryde	[MASK] and his police had pulled the thing straight a fine piece of work. They passed on to another and very painful subject: the trial. She would have to appear in court, identify the prisoner, and submit to cross-examination by an Indian lawyer.
APassageToIndia	56	74656	74630	74686	Ronny	He apologized to her for the condition of the country, with the result that she gave one of her sudden little shoots of tears. [MASK] wandered miserably about the room while she cried, treading upon the flowers of the Kashmir carpet that so inevitably covered it or drumming on the brass Benares bowls.
APassageToIndia	52	74832	74806	74858	Fielding	"I opened it, which is a strange confession to make. Will you forgive me? The circumstances are peculiar. It is from [MASK]." "Why should he write to me?" "A most lamentable thing has happened. The defence got hold of him.
APassageToIndia	42	74871	74852	74894	Ronny	The defence got hold of him." "He's a crank, a crank," said [MASK] lightly. "That's your way of putting it, but a man can be a crank without being a cad.
APassageToIndia	48	75143	75134	75182	Ronny	"But think of his behaviour to you, [MASK]. When you had already to bear so much for my sake! It was shocking of him. My dear, how can I repay you? How can one repay when one has nothing to give?
APassageToIndia	42	75491	75490	75532	Ronny	Then [MASK] drove her back. It was early in the morning, for the day, as the hot weather advanced, swelled like a monster at both ends, and left less and less room for the movements of mortals.
APassageToIndia	49	75656	75614	75663	Ronny	"What can I do to make things easier for you? it's you who matter," she sighed. "Dear old girl to say so." "Dear old boy." Then she cried: "[MASK], she isn't ill too?
APassageToIndia	49	75872	75862	75911	Ronny	You appeared all right when I left," said [MASK], trying not to speak crossly, but he had instructed her to give the girl a pleasant welcome, and he could not but feel annoyed. "I am all right," she said heavily.
APassageToIndia	54	75989	75972	76026	Adela	" "There is plenty of time for all such plans. How do you think our [MASK] looks?" "I am counting on you to help me through; it is such a blessing to be with you again, everyone else is a stranger," said the girl rapidly.
APassageToIndia	48	76136	76119	76167	Adela	"I know it's all nothing; I must be sensible, I do try " [MASK] continued, working again towards tears. "I shouldn't mind if it had happened anywhere else; at least I really don't know where it did happen.
APassageToIndia	50	76169	76168	76218	Ronny	" [MASK] supposed that he understood what she meant: she could not identify or describe the particular cave, indeed almost refused to have her mind cleared up about it, and it was recognized that the defence would try to make capital out of this during the trial.
APassageToIndia	51	76492	76467	76518	Ronny	Not to die," she added sourly. "No doubt you expect me to die, but when I have seen you and [MASK] married, and seen the other two and whether they want to be married I'll retire then into a cave of my own."
APassageToIndia	47	76688	76653	76700	Adela	"I will not be dragged in at all." "I won't have her dragged in, either; I won't have any more trouble on my account," cried [MASK], and again took the hand, which was again withdrawn.
APassageToIndia	52	76743	76721	76773	Adela	No one blames you, mother, but the fact remains that you dropped off at the first cave, and encouraged [MASK] to go on with him alone, whereas if you'd been well enough to keep on too nothing would have happened. He planned it, I know.
APassageToIndia	53	76871	76853	76906	Adela	" "I'll not have you worry her whether she's well or ill," said [MASK], leaving the sofa and taking his arm; then dropped it with a sigh and sat down again. But he was pleased she had rallied to him and surveyed his mother patronizingly.
APassageToIndia	51	76928	76915	76966	India	She was by no means the dear old lady outsiders supposed, and [MASK] had brought her into the open. "I shall attend your marriage, but not your trial," she informed them, tapping her knee; she had become very restless, and rather ungraceful.
APassageToIndia	54	77381	77345	77399	Adela	"Well, my dear girl, this isn't much of a home-coming," he said at last. "I had no idea she had this up her sleeve." [MASK] had stopped crying. An extraordinary expression was on her face, half relief, half horror.
APassageToIndia	49	77462	77416	77465	Aziz	It had become synonymous with the power of evil. He was "the prisoner," "the person in question," "the defence," and the sound of it now rang out like the first note of new symphony. "[MASK] . . .
APassageToIndia	45	77489	77488	77533	Ronny	"[MASK], he's innocent; I made an awful mistake." "Well, sit down anyhow." He looked round the room, but only two sparrows were chasing one another. She obeyed and took hold of his hand.
APassageToIndia	45	77592	77560	77605	Das	"My echo's better." "That's good. You'll be perfectly well in a few days, but you must save yourself up for the trial. [MASK] is a very good fellow, we shall all be with you.
APassageToIndia	41	77814	77793	77834	Callendar	"Half a minute," he remarked when the anecdote was over, and went to the telephone to ask [MASK] to look in as soon as he found it convenient, because she hadn't borne the journey well.
APassageToIndia	52	77938	77914	77966	Ronny	she asked, quite reasonable, open to every suggestion anyway. "She never mentioned that name once." "But, [MASK], I heard her." "Pure illusion. You can't be quite well, can you, to make up a thing like that.
APassageToIndia	48	78083	78055	78103	Fielding	" "Never, never, my dear girl. Complete illusion. His name was not mentioned by anyone. Look here you are confusing this with [MASK]'s letter." "That's it, that's it," she cried, greatly relieved.
APassageToIndia	51	78321	78315	78366	Ronny	To clear the confusion up, [MASK] asked her point-blank whether she had mentioned the prisoner. She could not understand the question and the reason of it had to be explained. She replied: "I never said his name," and began to play patience.
APassageToIndia	52	78420	78389	78441	Ronny	" "Of course he is innocent," she answered indifferently: it was the first time she had expressed an opinion on the point. "You see, [MASK], I was right," said the girl. "You were not right, she never said it.
APassageToIndia	49	78477	78442	78491	Fielding	" "But she thinks it." "Who cares what she thinks?" "Red nine on black ten " from the card-table. "She can think, and [MASK] too, but there's such a thing as evidence, I suppose.
APassageToIndia	52	78667	78649	78701	Adela	and ending everything the echo." "I don't hear it so much," said [MASK], moving towards her. "You send it away, you do nothing but good, you are so good." "I am not good, no, bad."
APassageToIndia	50	78820	78778	78828	Ronny	But I will not help you to torture him for what he never did. There are different ways of evil and I prefer mine to yours." "Have you any evidence in the prisoner's favour?" said [MASK] in the tones of the just official.
APassageToIndia	47	78936	78890	78937	Adela	"I have heard both English and Indians speak well of him, and I felt it isn't the sort of thing he would do." "Feeble, mother, feeble." "Most feeble." "And most inconsiderate to [MASK].
APassageToIndia	50	78939	78938	78988	Adela	" [MASK] said: "It would be so appalling if I was wrong. I should take my own life." He turned on her with: "What was I warning you just now? You know you're right, and the whole station knows it.
APassageToIndia	49	79851	79811	79860	Adela	Before time, it was before space also. Something snub-nosed, incapable of generosity the undying worm itself. Since hearing its voice, she had not entertained one large thought, she was actually envious of [MASK]. All this fuss over a frightened girl!
APassageToIndia	53	80024	80024	80077	Antony	[MASK] couldn't come either, in case he never returned to give his evidence. So she travelled with no one who could remind her of the past. This was a relief. The heat had drawn back a little before its next advance, and the journey was not unpleasant.
APassageToIndia	46	81863	81855	81901	Chandrapore	Under his very eyes, the temper of [MASK] was altering. As his car turned out of the compound, there was a tap of silly anger on its paint a pebble thrown by a child. Some larger stones were dropped near the mosque.
APassageToIndia	58	82087	82047	82105	Miss	"After all, it's our women who make everything more difficult out here," was his inmost thought, as he caught sight of some obscenities upon a long blank wall, and beneath his chivalry to [MASK] Quested resentment lurked, waiting its day perhaps there is a grain of resentment in all chivalry.
APassageToIndia	46	82322	82294	82340	Fielding	A new spirit seemed abroad, a rearrangement, which no one in the stern little band of whites could explain. There was a tendency to see [MASK] at the back of it: the idea that he was weak and cranky had been dropped.
APassageToIndia	45	82472	82465	82510	Nancy	"I don't think so, [MASK], and I seem able to do nothing for myself." "But you're strictly forbidden to talk like that; you're wonderful." "Yes indeed," came the reverent chorus.
APassageToIndia	46	82521	82484	82530	Ronny	" "But you're strictly forbidden to talk like that; you're wonderful." "Yes indeed," came the reverent chorus. "My old Das is all right," said [MASK], starting a new subject in low tones.
APassageToIndia	55	82678	82629	82684	Adela	He pointed out that from one point of view it was good that an Indian was taking the case. Conviction was inevitable; so better let an Indian pronounce it, there would be less fuss in the long run. Interested in the argument, he let [MASK] become dim in his mind.
APassageToIndia	43	82764	82726	82769	Lesley	" "I didn't mean that . . ." "All right. I said don't apologize." "Those swine are always on the look-out for a grievance," said [MASK], to propitiate her.
APassageToIndia	56	82771	82770	82826	Swine	"[MASK], I should think so," the Major echoed. "And what's more, I'll tell you what. What's happened is a damn good thing really, barring of course its application to present company. It'll make them squeal and it's time they did squeal.
APassageToIndia	44	82862	82841	82885	Nureddin	You should see the grandson of our so-called leading loyalist." He tittered brutally as he described poor [MASK]'s present appearance. "His beauty's gone, five upper teeth, two lower and a nostril. . . .
APassageToIndia	44	83288	83274	83318	Adela	The Court was crowded and of course very hot, and the first person [MASK] noticed in it was the humblest of all who were present, a person who had no bearing officially upon the trial: the man who pulled the punkah.
APassageToIndia	56	84448	84435	84491	India	Beneath her were gathered all the wreckage of her silly attempt to see [MASK] the people she had met at the Bridge Party, the man and his wife who hadn't sent their carriage, the old man who would lend his car, various servants, villagers, officials, and the prisoner himself.
APassageToIndia	49	86513	86474	86523	Das	Ingenious." He looked into their wide-open mouths. "They get just like over their religion," he added calmly. "Start and can't stop. I'm sorry for your old [MASK], he's not getting much of a show.
APassageToIndia	49	86623	86621	86670	Ronny	" "[MASK] " "Yes, old girl?" "Isn't it all queer." "I'm afraid it's very upsetting for you." "Not the least. I don't mind it." "Well, that's good.
APassageToIndia	45	87079	87037	87082	Das	He added with forensic humour: "Perhaps you can persuade the gentlemen outside to withdraw it too," for the refrain in the street continued. "I am afraid my powers do not extend so far," said [MASK], smiling.
APassageToIndia	56	87090	87083	87139	Adela	So peace was restored, and when [MASK] came to give her evidence the atmosphere was quieter than it had been since the beginning of the trial. Experts were not surprised. There is no stay in your native. He blazes up over a minor point, and has nothing left for the crisis.
APassageToIndia	47	87168	87124	87171	Aziz	He blazes up over a minor point, and has nothing left for the crisis. What he seeks is a grievance, and this he had found in the supposed abduction of an old lady. He would now be less aggrieved when [MASK] was deported.
APassageToIndia	52	87774	87728	87780	Aziz	" "And the prisoner followed you." "Now we've got 'im," from the Major. She was silent. The court, the place of question, awaited her reply. But she could not give it until [MASK] entered the place of answer.
APassageToIndia	52	87867	87849	87901	Aziz	She saw herself in one, and she was also outside it, watching its entrance, for [MASK] to pass in. She failed to locate him. It was the doubt that had often visited her, but solid and attractive, like the hills, "I am not "
APassageToIndia	48	88037	87990	88038	Fielding	" She shook her head. "What do you mean, please?" "No," she said in a flat, unattractive voice. Slight noises began in various parts of the room, but no one yet understood what was occurring except [MASK].
APassageToIndia	53	88655	88655	88708	Victory	[MASK] on this side, defeat on that complete for one moment was the antithesis. Then life returned to its complexities, person after person struggled out of the room to their various purposes, and before long no one remained on the scene of the fantasy but the beautiful naked god.
APassageToIndia	53	89403	89357	89410	Rafi	"I don't want the rubbish; get out." "Sir, I am a horse, we shall be your horses," another cried as he lifted the shafts of the victoria into the air. "Fetch my sais, [MASK]; there's a good chap.
APassageToIndia	49	89425	89424	89473	Fielding	" [MASK] wearied of his students. The more they honoured him the less they obeyed. They lassoed him with jasmine and roses, scratched the splash-board against a wall, and recited a poem, the noise of which filled the lane with a crowd.
APassageToIndia	44	89650	89640	89684	Fielding	That was the criticism. Nor was it unjust. [MASK] shared it himself, and knew that if some misunderstanding occurred, and an attack was made on the girl by his allies, he would be obliged to die in her defence.
APassageToIndia	52	90111	90088	90140	Mohurram	"It is fate," he said; and, "It is fate," when he was imprisoned anew after [MASK]. All that existed, in that terrible time, was affection, and affection was all that he felt in the first painful moments of his freedom.
APassageToIndia	48	90145	90113	90161	Cyril	All that existed, in that terrible time, was affection, and affection was all that he felt in the first painful moments of his freedom. "Why isn't [MASK] following? Let us turn back." But the procession could not turn back.
APassageToIndia	56	90326	90324	90380	Nureddin	" "[MASK]?" "They are torturing him." "Oh, my God . . ." for this, too, was a friend. "They are not. I will not have my grandson made an excuse for an attack on the hospital," the old man protested.
APassageToIndia	48	90385	90359	90407	Callendar	I will not have my grandson made an excuse for an attack on the hospital," the old man protested. "They are. [MASK] boasted so before the trial. I heard through the tatties; he said, I have tortured that nigger.'
APassageToIndia	43	90465	90463	90506	Pepper	" "[MASK]. Civil Surgeon said so. They hope to destroy us one by one; they shall fail." The new injury lashed the crowd to fury. It had been aimless hitherto, and had lacked a grievance.
APassageToIndia	47	90841	90841	90888	Aziz	[MASK] was silent, the others thickened their throats and threw up their chins in token of scorn. "I was afraid, I was mislaid," the suppliant continued. "I was mislaid here, there, and everywhere as regards your character.
APassageToIndia	50	91031	91026	91076	Nureddin	When he found they wanted [MASK], he skipped like a goat, he scuttled like a hen to do their bidding, the hospital was saved, and to the end of his life he could not understand why he had not obtained promotion on the morning's work.
APassageToIndia	52	92371	92322	92374	McBryde	"Events presented themselves to me in their logical sequence," was what she said, but it hadn't been that at all. "My belief and of course I was listening carefully, in hope you would make some slip my belief is that poor [MASK] exorcised you.
APassageToIndia	51	92710	92660	92711	Fielding	The underlying notion was, "It disgraces me to have been mentioned in connection with such a hag." It enraged him that he had been accused by a woman who had no personal beauty; sexually, he was a snob. This had puzzled and worried [MASK].
APassageToIndia	51	92906	92893	92944	Aziz	" "Exactly, the guide. I often think so. Unluckily [MASK] hit him on the face, and he got a fright and disappeared. It is most unsatisfactory, and we hadn't the police to help us, the guide was of no interest to them.
APassageToIndia	59	93012	92967	93026	Hamidullah	"Or could it have been one of that gang of Pathans who have been drifting through the district?" "Someone who was in another cave, and followed me when the guide was looking away? Possibly." At that moment [MASK] joined them, and seemed not too pleased to find them closeted together.
APassageToIndia	49	93256	93242	93291	Adela	" "It must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers," said [MASK], addressing him nervously. "The fact is that I realized before it was too late that I had made a mistake, and had just enough presence of mind to say so.
APassageToIndia	50	93532	93518	93568	Fielding	" "Not at all, we were only discussing possibilities," interposed [MASK]. "An interesting pastime, but a lengthy one. There are one hundred and seventy million Indians in this notable peninsula, and of course one or other of them entered the cave.
APassageToIndia	48	93804	93793	93841	Hamidullah	" "I don't agree at all," said [MASK], with every symptom of dismay. "The idea is a thoroughly bad one. There may quite well be another demonstration to-night, and suppose an attack is made on the College.
APassageToIndia	58	93943	93903	93961	McBryde	It's not an attack from our people I fear you should see their orderly conduct at the hospital; what we must guard against is an attack secretly arranged by the police for the purpose of discrediting you. [MASK] keeps plenty of roughs for this purpose, and this would be the very opportunity for him.
APassageToIndia	48	93997	93980	94028	Aziz	He had a natural sympathy for the down-trodden that was partly why he rallied from [MASK] and had become determined not to leave the poor girl in the lurch. Also, he had a new-born respect for her, consequent on their talk.
APassageToIndia	54	94252	94244	94298	India	A few garlands from students was all that [MASK] ever gave her in return. "But where is she to have her dinner, where is she to sleep? I say here, here, and if she is hit on the head by roughs, she is hit on the head.
APassageToIndia	51	94409	94401	94452	Hamidullah	She spoke without bitterness, or, as [MASK] thought, without proper pride. Her aim was to cause the minimum of annoyance. "Far better stop here than expose yourself to insults from that preposterous woman." "Do you find her preposterous? I used to.
APassageToIndia	47	94707	94661	94708	Hamidullah	"You'll find him on the verandah. He prefers not to come in." "Does he tell me to come out to him?" "Whether he tells you or not, you will go, I think," said [MASK].
APassageToIndia	55	94766	94740	94795	Ronny	"Thank goodness, that's over," he remarked, not escorting her to the verandah, for he held it unnecessary to see [MASK] again. "It was insulting of him not to come in." "He couldn't very well after my behaviour to him at the Club.
APassageToIndia	47	94848	94842	94889	Hamidullah	I'm sorry," said [MASK] rather indifferently. "She died at sea." "The heat, I suppose." "Presumably." "May is no month to allow an old lady to travel in." "Quite so.
APassageToIndia	50	94890	94858	94908	Heaslop	" "The heat, I suppose." "Presumably." "May is no month to allow an old lady to travel in." "Quite so. [MASK] ought never to have let her go, and he knows it. Shall we be off?
APassageToIndia	50	95373	95355	95405	Heaslop	"Ah me!" She sat down, and seemed to stiffen into a monument. "[MASK] is waiting for you, I think." "I do so long to be alone. She was my best friend, far more to me than to him.
APassageToIndia	41	95413	95382	95423	Ronny	" "I do so long to be alone. She was my best friend, far more to me than to him. I can't bear to be with [MASK] . . . I can't explain . . .
APassageToIndia	41	95891	95871	95912	Fielding	After that, he watched the semi-chivalrous behavings of the three English with quiet amusement; he thought [MASK] had been incredibly silly and weak, and he was amazed by the younger people's want of proper pride.
APassageToIndia	46	95967	95950	95996	Fielding	" "Twenty thousand rupees." No more was then said, but the remark horrified [MASK]. He couldn't bear to think of the queer honest girl losing her money and possibly her young man too. She advanced into his consciousness suddenly.
APassageToIndia	44	96085	96082	96126	Aziz	CHAPTER XXVII "[MASK], are you awake?" "No, so let us have a talk; let us dream plans for the future." "I am useless at dreaming." "Good night then, dear fellow.
APassageToIndia	54	96374	96342	96396	Fielding	This is what I have always wished, and as the result of my misfortunes it has come." "You have won a great victory . . ." began [MASK]. "I know, my dear chap, I know; your voice need not become so solemn and anxious.
APassageToIndia	56	96411	96397	96453	Miss	I know what you are going to say next: Let, oh let [MASK] Quested off paying, so that the English may say, Here is a native who has actually behaved like a gentleman; if it was not for his black face we would almost allow him to join our club.'
APassageToIndia	51	96536	96511	96562	Fielding	He is so funny when this is done to him asleep." The remark was not a question but a full-stop. [MASK] accepted it as such and there was a pause, pleasantly filled by a little wind which managed to brush the top of the house.
APassageToIndia	44	96631	96595	96639	Indians	Civilization strays about like a ghost here, revisiting the ruins of empire, and is to be found not in great works of art or mighty deeds, but in the gestures well-bred [MASK] make when they sit or lie down.
APassageToIndia	51	97767	97757	97808	Aziz	Your emotions never seem in proportion to their objects, [MASK]." "Is emotion a sack of potatoes, so much the pound, to be measured out? Am I a machine? I shall be told I can use up my emotions by using them, next.
APassageToIndia	54	97934	97922	97976	Imprisonment	He was good-tempered and affectionate but a little formidable. [MASK] had made channels for his character, which would never fluctuate as widely now as in the past. "Because it is far better you put all your difficulties before me, if we are to be friends for ever.
APassageToIndia	45	98938	98894	98939	Aziz	He had behaved badly to her, and he had either to repent (which involved a mental overturn), or to persist in unkindness towards her. He chose the latter course. How tiresome she had been with her patronage of [MASK]!
APassageToIndia	51	98945	98940	98991	Adela	What a bad influence upon [MASK]! And now she still gave trouble with ridiculous "tombs," mixing herself up with natives. She could not help it, of course, but she had attempted similar exasperating expeditions in her lifetime, and he reckoned it against her.
APassageToIndia	53	99058	99058	99111	Ronny	[MASK]'s religion was of the sterilized Public School brand, which never goes bad, even in the tropics. Wherever he entered, mosque, cave, or temple, he retained the spiritual outlook of the Fifth Form, and condemned as "weakening" any attempt to understand them.
APassageToIndia	53	99256	99256	99309	Aziz	[MASK] was suing her for damages in the sub-judge's court. Then he would ask her to release him. She had killed his love, and it had never been very robust; they would never have achieved betrothal but for the accident to the Nawab Bahadur's car.
APassageToIndia	50	99674	99642	99692	Disaster	A house to live in, a garden to walk in during the brief moment of the cool that was all she asked, and he was able to provide them. [MASK] had shown her her limitations, and he realized now what a fine loyal character she was.
APassageToIndia	49	99730	99693	99742	Aziz	Her humility was touching. She never repined at getting the worst of both worlds; she regarded it as the due punishment of her stupidity. When he hinted to her that a personal apology to [MASK] might be seemly, she said sadly: "Of course.
APassageToIndia	49	99916	99873	99922	Aziz	I thought that if I was just and asked questions I would come through every difficulty." He replied: "Our letter is a failure for a simple reason which we had better face: you have no real affection for [MASK], or Indians generally."
APassageToIndia	49	100007	99991	100040	Heaslop	Then she said: "Do I like anyone, though?" Presumably she liked [MASK], and he changed the subject, for this side of her life did not concern him. His Indian friends were, on the other hand, a bit above themselves.
APassageToIndia	54	100321	100291	100345	Aziz	When they argued about it something racial intruded not bitterly, but inevitably, like the colour of their skins: coffee-colour versus pinko-grey. And [MASK] would conclude: "Can't you see that I'm grateful to you for your help and want to reward you?"
APassageToIndia	48	100454	100454	100502	Fielding	[MASK]'s first attempt was a failure. The reply was: "I see your trick. I want revenge on them. Why should I be insulted and suffer and the contents of my pockets read and my wife's photograph taken to the police station?
APassageToIndia	50	100528	100503	100553	Fielding	Also I want the money to educate my little boys, as I explained to her." But he began to weaken, and [MASK] was not ashamed to practise a little necromancy. Whenever the question of compensation came up, he introduced the dead woman's name.
APassageToIndia	43	100576	100554	100597	Aziz	Just as other propagandists invented her a tomb, so did he raise a questionable image of her in the heart of [MASK], saying nothing that he believed to be untrue, but producing something that was probably far from the truth.
APassageToIndia	51	100854	100804	100855	Ronny	I have just arranged about her passage for her. I understand she would like to see you." "I shall go round at once." On reaching the College, he found her in some upset. He learnt that the engagement had been broken by [MASK].
APassageToIndia	51	101037	101020	101071	Ronny	My carefulness as to whether we should marry or not . . . and in the end [MASK] and I part and aren't even sorry. We ought never to have thought of marriage. Weren't you amazed when our engagement was originally announced?" "Not much.
APassageToIndia	53	101192	101166	101219	Ronny	About marriage I am cynical." "I am not. This false start has been all my own fault. I was bringing to [MASK] nothing that ought to be brought, that was why he rejected me really. I entered that cave thinking: Am I fond of him?
APassageToIndia	49	101440	101429	101478	Adela	Telepathy? What an explanation! Better withdraw it, and [MASK] did so. She was at the end of her spiritual tether, and so was he. Were there worlds beyond which they could never touch, or did all that is possible enter their consciousness?
APassageToIndia	51	101631	101600	101651	Indians	" "I think so," he replied after a pause. "I have never felt more happy and secure out here. I really do get on with [MASK], and they do trust me. It's pleasant that I haven't had to resign my job.
APassageToIndia	52	101684	101639	101691	Aziz	It's pleasant that I haven't had to resign my job. It's pleasant to be praised by an L.-G. Until the next earthquake I remain as I am." "Of course this death has been troubling me." "[MASK] was so fond of her too.
APassageToIndia	49	102141	102104	102153	Adela	" "Quite a chance. I have a scheme on now as a matter of fact." "Oh, that would be very nice." So it petered out. Ten days later [MASK] went off, by the same route as her dead friend.
APassageToIndia	42	102233	102232	102274	Antony	Perhaps [MASK] was discontented with his tip. She rang the cabin bell and had him turned out, but his statement created rather a scandal, and people did not speak to her much during the first part of the voyage.
APassageToIndia	46	102832	102824	102870	Das	" "I fear not," said [MASK], who had much mental clearness. "And for that reason, if I may say so, do not introduce too many Persian expressions into the poem, and not too much about the bulbul.
APassageToIndia	51	102879	102840	102891	Aziz	"And for that reason, if I may say so, do not introduce too many Persian expressions into the poem, and not too much about the bulbul." "Half a sec," said [MASK], biting his pencil. He was writing out a prescription.
APassageToIndia	54	102982	102929	102983	Aziz	" "I know you bear me a grudge for trying that case," said the other, stretching out his hand impulsively. "You are so kind and friendly, but always I detect irony beneath your manner." "No, no, what nonsense!" protested [MASK].
APassageToIndia	49	103016	102984	103033	Indians	They shook hands, in a half-embrace that typified the entente. Between people of distant climes there is always the possibility of romance, but the various branches of [MASK] know too much about each other to surmount the unknowable easily. The approach is prosaic.
APassageToIndia	43	103088	103073	103116	Das	They smiled wistfully, each spying the thought in the other's heart, and [MASK], the more articulate, said: "Excuse my mistakes, realize my limitations. Life is not easy as we know it on the earth.
APassageToIndia	45	103581	103564	103609	Hamidullah	"My great mistake has been taking our rulers as a joke," he said to [MASK] next day; who replied with a sigh: "It is far the wisest way to take them, but not possible in the long run.
APassageToIndia	48	103759	103745	103793	Babur	I think I could write poetry there. I wish I had lived in [MASK]'s time and fought and written for him. Gone, gone, and not even any use to say Gone, gone,' for it weakens us while we say it.
APassageToIndia	51	103799	103769	103820	Hamidullah	Gone, gone, and not even any use to say Gone, gone,' for it weakens us while we say it. We need a king, [MASK]; it would make our lives easier. As it is, we must try to appreciate these quaint Hindus.
APassageToIndia	48	104042	104030	104078	Aziz	Accept the consequences of your own actions like a man." [MASK] winked at him slowly and said: "We are not in the law courts. There are many ways of being a man; mine is to express what is deepest in my heart.
APassageToIndia	49	104166	104142	104191	Aziz	rather too late in the evening, the servants say." "A pleasant change for her if he did," said [MASK], making a curious face. "But you understand my meaning?" The young man winked again and said: "Just!
APassageToIndia	50	104244	104212	104262	Hamidullah	The problem is, for where? I am determined to write poetry. The problem is, about what? You give me no assistance." Then, surprising both [MASK] and himself, he had an explosion of nerves. "But who does give me assistance?
APassageToIndia	45	104340	104338	104383	Nureddin	" "[MASK]'s mother is visiting my wife now. That is all right, I think." "They come before me separately, but not so far together. You had better prepare them for the united shock of my face.
APassageToIndia	53	104449	104406	104459	Fielding	They pretended at the time of your trial they would give up purdah; indeed, those of them who can write composed a document to that effect, and now it ends in humbug. You know how deeply they all respect [MASK], but not one of them has seen him.
APassageToIndia	58	104605	104575	104633	Aziz	If you want a subject for a poem, take this: The Indian lady as she is and not as she is supposed to be." CHAPTER XXXI [MASK] had no sense of evidence. The sequence of his emotions decided his beliefs, and led to the tragic coolness between himself and his English friend.
APassageToIndia	42	104688	104674	104716	Cyril	He had no objection on moral grounds to his friends amusing themselves, and [MASK], being middle-aged, could no longer expect the pick of the female market, and must take his amusement where he could find it.
APassageToIndia	53	104777	104751	104804	Fielding	He himself had told things sometimes regarded as shocking, and the Englishman had listened, tolerant, but surrendering nothing in return. He met [MASK] at the railway station on his return, agreed to dine with him, and then started taxing him by the oblique method, outwardly merry.
APassageToIndia	47	105009	104968	105015	Cyril	The new Civil Surgeon is the same as the last, but does not yet dare to be. That is all any administrative change amounts to. All my suffering has won nothing for us. But look here, [MASK], while I remember it.
APassageToIndia	51	105298	105276	105327	Cyril	I can see from your face." "As far as I do mind. I travel light." "[MASK], that boastfulness about travelling light will be your ruin. It is raising up enemies against you on all sides, and makes me feel excessively uneasy.
APassageToIndia	46	105335	105328	105374	Aziz	" "What enemies?" Since [MASK] had only himself in mind, he could not reply. Feeling a fool, he became angrier. "I have given you list after list of the people who cannot be trusted in this city.
APassageToIndia	49	105567	105567	105616	Fielding	[MASK] was so startled at the story being taken seriously, and so disliked being called a naughty boy, that he lost his head and cried: "You little rotter! Well, I'm damned. Amusement indeed. Is it likely at such a time?
APassageToIndia	53	105664	105617	105670	Aziz	" "Oh, I beg your pardon, I'm sure. The licentious Oriental imagination was at work," he replied, speaking gaily, but cut to the heart; for hours after his mistake he bled inwardly. "You see, [MASK], the circumstances . . .
APassageToIndia	47	105678	105671	105718	Heaslop	also the girl was still engaged to [MASK], also I never felt . . ." "Yes, yes; but you didn't contradict what I said, so I thought it was true. Oh dear, East and West. Most misleading.
APassageToIndia	51	105846	105808	105859	Fielding	Unreserved regrets." "The fault is entirely mine." Tangles like this still interrupted their intercourse. A pause in the wrong place, an intonation misunderstood, and a whole conversation went awry. [MASK] had been startled, not shocked, but how convey the difference?
APassageToIndia	50	106012	105983	106033	M.L.	We are already much displeased with him. Will it satisfy you if we send him back to his family without a present?" "We'll discuss [MASK] at dinner." His eyes went clotted and hard. "Dinner. This is most unlucky I forgot.
APassageToIndia	53	106072	106049	106102	Fielding	" "He will have invited other friends." "You are coming to dinner with me as arranged," said [MASK], looking away. "I don't stand this. You are coming to dinner with me. You come." They had reached the hospital now.
APassageToIndia	49	106163	106134	106183	Turton	Their vehicles were parked side by side while their servants competed in the interior of the building. "Good morning; so you are back," said [MASK] icily. "I should be glad if you will put in your appearance at the club this evening.
APassageToIndia	50	106469	106459	106509	Fielding	This reflection about an echo lay at the verge of [MASK]'s mind. He could never develop it. It belonged to the universe that he had missed or rejected. And the mosque missed it too. Like himself, those shallow arcades provided but a limited asylum.
APassageToIndia	56	106552	106550	106606	Aziz	He found [MASK] overtired and dispirited, and he determined not to allude to their misunderstanding until the end of the evening; it would be more acceptable then. He made a clean breast about the club said he had only gone under compulsion, and should never attend again unless the order was renewed.
APassageToIndia	46	107085	107083	107129	Cyril	" "[MASK], you sometimes make a sensible remark. That will do for poetry for the present. Let us now return to your English visit." "We haven't discussed poetry for two seconds," said the other, smiling.
APassageToIndia	49	107131	107103	107152	Aziz	Let us now return to your English visit." "We haven't discussed poetry for two seconds," said the other, smiling. But [MASK] was addicted to cameos. He held the tiny conversation in his hand, and felt it epitomized his problem.
APassageToIndia	47	107405	107371	107418	Aziz	He was out of sorts and uneasy. The conversation jumped from topic to topic in a broken-backed fashion. They were affectionate and intimate, but nothing clicked tight. "[MASK], you have forgiven me the stupid remark I made this morning?
APassageToIndia	43	107684	107671	107714	Hassan	" "Like all evil things." To divert the conversation, [MASK] related how the kitchen-boy had killed a snake, good, but killed it by cutting it in two, bad, because it becomes two snakes.
APassageToIndia	58	107747	107715	107773	Aziz	"When he breaks a plate, does it become two plates?" "Glasses and a new teapot will similarly be required, also for myself a coat." [MASK] sighed. Each for himself. One man needs a coat, another a rich wife; each approaches his goal by a clever detour.
APassageToIndia	54	107812	107793	107847	Aziz	If he desired to marry her, all was explained; she would bring him a larger dowry. [MASK] did not believe his own suspicions better if he had, for then he would have denounced and cleared the situation up. Suspicion and belief could in his mind exist side by side.
APassageToIndia	50	108278	108257	108307	Aziz	But, alive or dead, I am absolutely devoid of morals. Do kindly grasp this about me." [MASK] did not care for the letter at all. It hurt his delicacy. He liked confidences, however gross, but generalizations and comparisons always repelled him.
APassageToIndia	52	110066	110045	110097	Godbole	Singing into one another's grey moustaches, they disentangled the chain from the tinsel into which it had sunk. [MASK] consulted the music-book, said a word to the drummer, who broke rhythm, made a thick little blur of sound, and produced a new rhythm.
APassageToIndia	51	110174	110174	110225	Chance	[MASK] brought her into his mind while it was in this heated state, he did not select her, she happened to occur among the throng of soliciting images, a tiny splinter, and he impelled her by his spiritual force to that place where completeness can be found.
APassageToIndia	44	110854	110846	110890	Indians	All sorrow was annihilated, not only for [MASK], but for foreigners, birds, caves, railways, and the stars; all became joy, all laughter; there had never been disease nor doubt, misunderstanding, cruelty, fear.
APassageToIndia	56	112313	112301	112357	Godbole	He added, "Sorry," which was right, for [MASK] twisted his head till it didn't belong to his body, and said in a strained voice that had no connection with his mind: "He arrived at the European Guest House perhaps at least possibly." "Did he?
APassageToIndia	42	112632	112623	112665	Hinduism	The fissures in the Indian soil are infinite: [MASK], so solid from a distance, is riven into sects and clans, which radiate and join, and change their names according to the aspect from which they are approached.
APassageToIndia	49	112690	112690	112739	Aziz	[MASK], the day of his inauguration, had remarked: "I study nothing, I respect" making an excellent impression. There was now a minimum of prejudice against him. Nominally under a Hindu doctor, he was really chief medicine man to the court.
APassageToIndia	51	113203	113175	113226	Bulbuls	"But we do not show our women to the foreigner" not explaining how this was to be managed, for he was writing a poem. [MASK] and roses would still persist, the pathos of defeated Islam remained in his blood and could not be expelled by modernities.
APassageToIndia	54	113947	113898	113952	Aziz	Was it correct that a torchlight procession would take place? If so, might they view it? They didn't want to give trouble, but if they might stand in a balcony, or if they might go out in a boat. . . . [MASK] tore the note up.
APassageToIndia	56	114241	114233	114289	Akbar	But soon he didn't mind, like [MASK]. After all, this saint had freed prisoners, and he himself had lain in prison. The Shrine of the Body lay in his own garden and produced a weekly crop of lamps and flowers, and when he saw them he recalled his sufferings.
APassageToIndia	59	115102	115090	115149	Moslem	The Aziz family did not grasp as much as this, being [MASK], but the visit to the Jail was common knowledge. Smiling, with downcast eyes, the prisoners discussed with the gentry their chances of salvation. Except for the irons on their legs, they resembled other men, nor did they feel different.
APassageToIndia	46	115279	115247	115293	Aziz	His death was being concealed lest the glory of the festival were dimmed. The Hindu physician, the Private Secretary, and a confidential servant remained with the corpse, while [MASK] had assumed the duty of being seen in public, and misleading people.
APassageToIndia	51	115381	115355	115406	Fielding	Hundreds of frogs lived in their own garden, but they must needs catch one up on the fort. They reported two topis below. [MASK] and his brother-in-law, instead of resting after their journey, were climbing the slope to the saint's tomb!
APassageToIndia	57	115425	115415	115472	Ahmed	"Put powdered glass in their pan?" "[MASK], come here for such wickedness." He raised his hand to smite his firstborn, but allowed it to be kissed instead. It was sweet to have his sons with him at this moment, and to know they were affectionate and brave.
APassageToIndia	52	115520	115503	115555	Hither	The two visitors entered the octagon, but rushed out at once pursued by some bees. [MASK] and thither they ran, beating their heads; the children shrieked with derision, and out of heaven, as if a plug had been pulled, fell a jolly dollop of rain.
APassageToIndia	54	115556	115556	115610	Aziz	[MASK] had not meant to greet his former friend, but the incident put him into an excellent temper. He felt compact and strong. He shouted out, "Hullo, gentlemen, are you in trouble?" The brother-in-law exclaimed; a bee had got him.
APassageToIndia	50	115712	115668	115718	Aziz	The swarm retired to the shrine. He went up to the stranger and pulled a couple of stings out of his wrist, remarking, "Come, pull yourself together and be a man." "How do you do, [MASK], after all this time?
APassageToIndia	47	115728	115719	115766	Fielding	I heard you were settled in here," [MASK] called to him, but not in friendly tones. "I suppose a couple of stings don't signify." "Not the least. I'll send an embrocation over to the Guest House.
APassageToIndia	48	115832	115832	115880	Fielding	[MASK] checked his antics rather sharply, then said: "Is there a short cut down to our carriage? We must give up our walk. The weather's pestilential." "Yes. That way." "Are you not coming down yourself?
APassageToIndia	48	116214	116210	116258	Godbole	"I wrote to [MASK] about it, but he has taken no notice; it's a place of the dead." "Perhaps your letter never reached the Minister in question." "Will there be any objection to English people watching the procession?
APassageToIndia	46	116524	116512	116558	Fielding	" "However did you make such a mistake?" said [MASK], more friendly than before, but scathing and scornful. "It's almost unbelievable. I should think I wrote you half a dozen times, mentioning my wife by name.
APassageToIndia	50	116915	116886	116936	Urdu	What difference did it make at this hour of the day? He had built his life on a mistake, but he had built it. Speaking in [MASK], that the children might understand, he said: "Please do not follow us, whomever you marry.
APassageToIndia	53	117184	117162	117215	Indra	Seated at his ease, he could witness the Three Steps by which the Saviour ascended the universe to the discomfiture of [MASK], also the death of the dragon, the mountain that turned into an umbrella, and the saddhu who (with comic results) invoked the God before dining.
APassageToIndia	54	117418	117414	117468	Mau	He was puzzled that [MASK] should suddenly be purged from suspicion and self-seeking. Although he was an outsider, and excluded from their rites, they were always particularly charming to him at this time; he and his household received small courtesies and presents, just because he was outside.
APassageToIndia	50	117763	117763	117813	Godbole	[MASK], who had never been known to tell anyone anything, smiled again, and said in deprecating tones: "Never be angry with me. I am, as far as my limitations permit, your true friend; besides, it is my holy festival."
APassageToIndia	58	117814	117791	117849	Aziz	I am, as far as my limitations permit, your true friend; besides, it is my holy festival." [MASK] always felt like a baby in that strange presence, a baby who unexpectedly receives a toy. He smiled also, and turned his horse into a lane, for the crush increased.
APassageToIndia	50	118584	118554	118604	Aziz	The European Guest House stood two hundred feet above the water, on the crest of a rocky and wooded spur that jutted from the jungle. By the time [MASK] arrived, the water had paled to a film of mauve-grey, and the boat vanished entirely.
APassageToIndia	42	118814	118800	118842	Stella	We need all the support we can get. I hope that next time [MASK] comes my way she will bring you with her, when I will make you as comfortable as a bachelor can it's certainly time we met.
APassageToIndia	47	119340	119337	119384	Aziz	The doctor in [MASK] thought, "Born of too old a mother," the poet found him rather beautiful. "I was unable to call earlier owing to pressure of work. How are the celebrated bee-stings?" he asked patronizingly.
APassageToIndia	50	119591	119542	119592	Aziz	This is a most strange remark. I am a qualified doctor, who will not hurt you." "I don't mind pain, there is no pain." "No pain?" "Not really." "Excellent news," sneered [MASK].
APassageToIndia	55	119768	119759	119814	Mau	"They have not gone in the direction of [MASK], I hope. On a night like this the people become most fanatical." And, as if to confirm him, there was a sob, as though the lips of a giant had parted; the procession was approaching the Jail.
APassageToIndia	42	120142	120130	120172	Aziz	"I must go back now, good night," said [MASK], and held out his hand, completely forgetting that they were not friends, and focusing his heart on something more distant than the caves, something beautiful.
APassageToIndia	43	120408	120404	120447	Heaslop	"But you are [MASK]'s brother also, and alas, the two nations cannot be friends." "I know. Not yet." "Did your mother speak to you about me?" "Yes."
APassageToIndia	48	120457	120424	120472	Aziz	" "I know. Not yet." "Did your mother speak to you about me?" "Yes." And with a swerve of voice and body that [MASK] did not follow he added, "In her letters, in her letters.
APassageToIndia	52	120811	120783	120835	Mau	One kind action was with him always a channel for another, and soon the torrent of his hospitality gushed forth and he began doing the honours of [MASK] and persuading himself that he understood the wild procession, which increased in lights and sounds as the complications of its ritual developed.
APassageToIndia	56	120855	120836	120892	Thorns	There was little need to row, for the freshening gale blew them in the direction they desired. [MASK] scratched the keel, they ran into an islet and startled some cranes. The strange temporary life of the August flood-water bore them up and seemed as though it would last for ever.
APassageToIndia	51	120988	120967	121018	Aziz	" "But there's no Rajah nothing " "Row back, you will see what I mean." [MASK] found it hard work against the advancing wind. But he fixed his eyes on the pin of light that marked the Guest House and backed a few strokes.
APassageToIndia	50	121159	121115	121165	Ralph	He had heard of the image made to imitate life at enormous expense but he had never chanced to see it before, though he frequently rowed on the lake. There was only one spot from which it could be seen, and [MASK] had directed him to it.
APassageToIndia	46	121229	121185	121231	Aziz	He remarked, "Shall we go back now?" "There is still the procession." "I'd rather not go nearer they have such strange customs, and might hurt you." "A little nearer." [MASK] obeyed.
APassageToIndia	56	121370	121322	121378	Rockets	We pretend he is alive until after the festival, to prevent unhappiness. Do you want to go still nearer?" "Yes." He tried to keep the boat out of the glare of the torches that began to star the other shore. [MASK] kept going off, also the guns.
APassageToIndia	52	121390	121379	121431	Krishna	Suddenly, closer than he had calculated, the palanquin of [MASK] appeared from behind a ruined wall, and descended the carven glistening water-steps. On either side of it the singers tumbled, a woman prominent, a wild and beautiful young saint with flowers in her hair.
APassageToIndia	42	122421	122421	122463	Fielding	[MASK] laughed at the tangle and waste of energy, but he did not travel as lightly as in the past; education was a continuous concern to him, because his income and the comfort of his family depended on it.
APassageToIndia	48	122830	122802	122850	Aziz	I have been so disgracefully hasty, thinking you meant to get hold of my money: as bad a mistake as the cave itself." "[MASK], I wish you would talk to my wife. She too believes that the Marabar is wiped out.
APassageToIndia	53	122994	122993	123046	Fielding	" [MASK] hesitated. He was not quite happy about his marriage. He was passionate physically again the final flare-up before the clinkers of middle age and he knew that his wife did not love him as much as he loved her, and he was ashamed of pestering her.
APassageToIndia	51	123228	123204	123255	Cyril	I partly love him because he brought me back to you to say good-bye. For this is good-bye, [MASK], though to think about it will spoil our ride and make us sad." "No, we won't think about it."
APassageToIndia	50	123337	123337	123387	Aziz	[MASK] was a memento, a trophy, they were proud of each other, yet they must inevitably part. And, anxious to make what he could of this last afternoon, he forced himself to speak intimately about his wife, the person most dear to him.
APassageToIndia	45	123398	123358	123403	Mau	And, anxious to make what he could of this last afternoon, he forced himself to speak intimately about his wife, the person most dear to him. He said: "From her point of view, [MASK] has been a success.
APassageToIndia	55	123541	123520	123575	Hindus	What I want to discover is its spiritual side, if it has one." "It is useless discussing [MASK] with me. Living with them teaches me no more. When I think I annoy them, I do not. When I think I don't annoy them, I do.
