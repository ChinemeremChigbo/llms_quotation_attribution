MansfieldPark	54	1972	1950	2004	Thomas	and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of bread to give her? My dear Sir [MASK], with all my faults I have a warm heart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing.
MansfieldPark	53	2047	2005	2058	Mansfield	So, if you are not against it, I will write to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon as matters are settled, _I_ will engage to get the child to [MASK]; _you_ shall have no trouble about it.
MansfieldPark	53	2881	2849	2902	Nanny	I only wish I could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power. I am not one of those that spare their own trouble; and [MASK] shall fetch her, however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days.
MansfieldPark	43	4894	4865	4908	Edmund	A week had passed in this way, and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet passive manner, when she was found one morning by her cousin [MASK], the youngest of the sons, sitting crying on the attic stairs.
MansfieldPark	49	5185	5148	5197	William	" On pursuing the subject, he found that, dear as all these brothers and sisters generally were, there was one among them who ran more in her thoughts than the rest. It was [MASK] whom she talked of most, and wanted most to see.
MansfieldPark	42	5257	5255	5297	William	"But [MASK] will write to you, I dare say." "Yes, he had promised he would, but he had told _her_ to write first." "And when shall you do it?"
MansfieldPark	49	5356	5348	5397	William	Would it make you happy to write to [MASK]?" "Yes, very." "Then let it be done now. Come with me into the breakfast-room, we shall find everything there, and be sure of having the room to ourselves.
MansfieldPark	45	5441	5398	5443	William	" "But, cousin, will it go to the post?" "Yes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and, as your uncle will frank it, it will cost [MASK] nothing.
MansfieldPark	42	5605	5605	5647	Fanny	[MASK]'s feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herself incapable of expressing; but her countenance and a few artless words fully conveyed all their gratitude and delight, and her cousin began to find her an interesting object.
MansfieldPark	53	5887	5842	5895	Norris	The little rusticities and awkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all, and not least of herself, necessarily wore away, and she was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle, nor did her aunt [MASK]'s voice make her start very much.
MansfieldPark	46	6638	6616	6662	Fanny	" "Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen. But I must tell you another thing of [MASK], so odd and so stupid. Do you know, she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing.
MansfieldPark	44	8179	8173	8217	Tom	"I blush for you, [MASK]," said he, in his most dignified manner; "I blush for the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion.
MansfieldPark	50	8791	8783	8833	Norris	She had never received kindness from her aunt [MASK], and could not love her. "I shall be very sorry to go away," said she, with a faltering voice. "Yes, I dare say you will; _that's_ natural enough.
MansfieldPark	48	8870	8834	8882	Fanny	I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world." "I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt," said [MASK] modestly. "No, my dear; I hope not.
MansfieldPark	54	8940	8920	8974	Fanny	It can make very little difference to you, whether you are in one house or the other." [MASK] left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could not feel the difference to be so small, she could not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction.
MansfieldPark	48	8989	8988	9036	Cousin	"[MASK]," said she, "something is going to happen which I do not like at all; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first, you will not be able to do it now.
MansfieldPark	52	9099	9095	9147	Fanny	" "Well, [MASK], and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, I should call it an excellent one." "Oh, cousin!" "It has everything else in its favour. My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you.
MansfieldPark	49	9193	9172	9221	Fanny	You will be what you ought to be to her. I hope it does not distress you very much, [MASK]?" "Indeed it does: I cannot like it. I love this house and everything in it: I shall love nothing there.
MansfieldPark	51	9348	9317	9368	Fanny	" "What is to prevent you?" "Everything. My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness." "As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear [MASK], believe me, you never have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly.
MansfieldPark	46	9440	9418	9464	Fanny	I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion." "You are too kind," said [MASK], colouring at such praise; "how shall I ever thank you as I ought, for thinking so well of me.
MansfieldPark	52	9495	9489	9541	Fanny	" "Why, indeed, [MASK], I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House. You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever.
MansfieldPark	47	9676	9675	9722	Fanny	" [MASK] sighed, and said, "I cannot see things as you do; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself, and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be.
MansfieldPark	51	9773	9768	9819	Fanny	" "The place, [MASK], is what you will not quit, though you quit the house. You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever. Even _your_ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change.
MansfieldPark	47	10326	10318	10365	Fanny	Good heaven! what could I do with [MASK]? Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for anything, my spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl at her time of life? A girl of fifteen!
MansfieldPark	51	10467	10432	10483	Fanny	" "Indeed, I do not know. I suppose he thought it best." "But what did he say? He could not say he _wished_ me to take [MASK]. I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it.
MansfieldPark	42	12138	12114	12156	Fanny	"This was so thoughtful and kind!" and would he only have smiled upon her, and called her "my dear [MASK]," while he said it, every former frown or cold address might have been forgotten.
MansfieldPark	56	15799	15792	15848	Mary	"My dear sister," said [MASK], "if you can persuade him into anything of the sort, it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever, and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of.
MansfieldPark	46	15993	15976	16022	Mary	" "No, I am sure you are too good. You will be kinder than [MASK]. You will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience. I am of a cautious temper, and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry.
MansfieldPark	42	16807	16798	16840	Henry	" "I shall not talk to you, [MASK], but I know you _will_ like her best at last." "Do not I tell you that I like her best _at_ _first_?
MansfieldPark	48	17055	17055	17103	Talking	[MASK] does no good. He will be taken in at last." "But I would not have him _taken_ _in_; I would not have him duped; I would have it all fair and honourable." "Oh dear!
MansfieldPark	53	17539	17494	17547	Mary	When I am a wife, I mean to be just as staunch myself; and I wish my friends in general would be so too. It would save me many a heartache." "You are as bad as your brother, [MASK]; but we will cure you both.
MansfieldPark	56	18151	18108	18164	Fanny	Much was said on his side to induce her to attend the races, and schemes were made for a large party to them, with all the eagerness of inclination, but it would only do to be talked of. And [MASK], what was _she_ doing and thinking all this while?
MansfieldPark	56	18340	18339	18395	Edmund	" [MASK], to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, "I believe I know what you mean, but I will not undertake to answer the question. My cousin is grown up. She has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs and not outs are beyond me.
MansfieldPark	43	18787	18775	18818	Anderson	The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it. When [MASK] first introduced me to his family, about two years ago, his sister was not _out_, and I could not get her to speak to me.
MansfieldPark	53	19113	19100	19153	Edmund	" "The error is plain enough," said the less courteous [MASK]; "such girls are ill brought up. They are given wrong notions from the beginning. They are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour _before_
MansfieldPark	41	19638	19611	19652	Edmund	Does she go to balls? Does she dine out every where, as well as at my sister's?" "No," replied [MASK]; "I do not think she has ever been to a ball.
MansfieldPark	47	20069	20056	20103	Smith	I never saw a place so altered in my life. I told [MASK] I did not know where I was. The approach _now_, is one of the finest things in the country: you see the house in the most surprising manner.
MansfieldPark	44	21608	21594	21638	Elizabeth	In any particular style of building?" "The house was built in [MASK]'s time, and is a large, regular, brick building; heavy, but respectable looking, and has many good rooms. It is ill placed.
MansfieldPark	42	22094	22061	22103	Henry	I would have everything as complete as possible in the country, shrubberies and flower-gardens, and rustic seats innumerable: but it must all be done without my care. [MASK] is different; he loves to be doing.
MansfieldPark	45	22757	22731	22776	Edmund	Henry, who is good-nature itself, has offered to fetch it in his barouche. Will it not be honourably conveyed?" [MASK] spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument, and hoped to be soon allowed to hear her.
MansfieldPark	57	23478	23477	23534	Edmund	" [MASK] again felt grave, and only replied, "It is a noble profession." "Yes, the profession is well enough under two circumstances: if it make the fortune, and there be discretion in spending it; but, in short, it is not a favourite profession of mine.
MansfieldPark	58	23789	23732	23790	Julia	In extent, it is a mere nothing; you would be surprised at its insignificance; and, as for improvement, there was very little for me to do too little: I should like to have been busy much longer." "You are fond of the sort of thing?" said [MASK].
MansfieldPark	53	23837	23791	23844	Everingham	"Excessively; but what with the natural advantages of the ground, which pointed out, even to a very young eye, what little remained to be done, and my own consequent resolutions, I had not been of age three months before [MASK] was all that it is now.
MansfieldPark	48	24460	24441	24489	Fanny	She has a wonderful play of feature! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you, [MASK], as not quite right?" "Oh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did. I was quite astonished.
MansfieldPark	54	24901	24854	24908	William	She made me almost laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly the love or good-nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters, when they are separated. I am sure [MASK] would never have used _me_
MansfieldPark	46	25153	25153	25199	Edmund	[MASK] was at the Parsonage every day, to be indulged with his favourite instrument: one morning secured an invitation for the next; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener, and every thing was soon in a fair train.
MansfieldPark	52	25889	25867	25919	Fanny	The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to begin; and [MASK], on its being first proposed, so far from feeling slighted, was almost over-powered with gratitude that he should be asking her leave for it.
MansfieldPark	54	26270	26225	26279	Edmund	A happy party it appeared to her, all interested in one object: cheerful beyond a doubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her. It was a sound which did not make _her_ cheerful; she wondered that [MASK] should forget her, and felt a pang.
MansfieldPark	51	26364	26356	26407	Edmund	After a few minutes they stopped entirely. [MASK] was close to her; he was speaking to her; he was evidently directing her management of the bridle; he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach.
MansfieldPark	52	27191	27175	27227	Maria	Her figure is as neat as her brother's." "Yes," added [MASK], "and her spirits are as good, and she has the same energy of character. I cannot but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind.
MansfieldPark	54	27405	27368	27422	Fanny	It would be very wrong if she did. _She_ rides only for pleasure; _you_ for health." "I shall not ride to-morrow, certainly," said [MASK]; "I have been out very often lately, and would rather stay at home.
MansfieldPark	56	27976	27968	28024	Fanny	"That is a very foolish trick, [MASK], to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa. Why cannot you come and sit here, and employ yourself as _we_ do? If you have no work of your own, I can supply you from the poor basket.
MansfieldPark	52	28350	28335	28387	Fanny	I sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden, while [MASK] cut the roses; and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot. It was shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite dreaded the coming home again.
MansfieldPark	50	28390	28388	28438	Fanny	" "[MASK] has been cutting roses, has she?" "Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year. Poor thing! _She_ found it hot enough; but they were so full-blown that one could not wait.
MansfieldPark	57	28684	28649	28706	Fanny	" "But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?" "No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and, unluckily, [MASK] forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key, so she was obliged to go again.
MansfieldPark	57	28873	28846	28903	Fanny	I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really I cannot do everything at once. And as for [MASK]'s just stepping down to my house for me it is not much above a quarter of a mile I cannot think I was unreasonable to ask it.
MansfieldPark	46	29241	29210	29256	Edmund	She wished to be able to decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, made it easier to swallow than to speak. Vexed as [MASK] was with his mother and aunt, he was still more angry with himself.
MansfieldPark	53	29357	29357	29410	Fanny	[MASK] went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her arrival at the Park. The state of her spirits had probably had its share in her indisposition; for she had been feeling neglected, and been struggling against discontent and envy for some days past.
MansfieldPark	53	29449	29411	29464	Edmund	As she leant on the sofa, to which she had retreated that she might not be seen, the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head; and the sudden change which [MASK]'s kindness had then occasioned, made her hardly know how to support herself.
MansfieldPark	41	30667	30635	30676	Edmund	I will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday." "There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant," said [MASK], "in going on the barouche box.
MansfieldPark	50	30819	30790	30840	Fanny	She is not expected." "You can have no reason, I imagine, madam," said he, addressing his mother, "for wishing [MASK] _not_ to be of the party, but as it relates to yourself, to your own comfort.
MansfieldPark	49	31777	31734	31783	Pug	The former was on the barouche-box in a moment, the latter took her seat within, in gloom and mortification; and the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies, and the barking of [MASK] in his mistress's arms.
MansfieldPark	41	31793	31784	31825	Fanny	Their road was through a pleasant country; and [MASK], whose rides had never been extensive, was soon beyond her knowledge, and was very happy in observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty.
MansfieldPark	43	31949	31945	31988	Fanny	She had none of [MASK]'s delicacy of taste, of mind, of feeling; she saw Nature, inanimate Nature, with little observation; her attention was all for men and women, her talents for the light and lively.
MansfieldPark	53	31993	31989	32042	Edmund	In looking back after [MASK], however, when there was any stretch of road behind them, or when he gained on them in ascending a considerable hill, they were united, and a "there he is" broke at the same moment from them both, more than once.
MansfieldPark	52	33516	33516	33568	Fanny	[MASK]'s imagination had prepared her for something grander than a mere spacious, oblong room, fitted up for the purpose of devotion: with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion of mahogany, and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of the family gallery above.
MansfieldPark	52	33584	33569	33621	Edmund	"I am disappointed," said she, in a low voice, to [MASK]. "This is not my idea of a chapel. There is nothing awful here, nothing melancholy, nothing grand. Here are no aisles, no arches, no inscriptions, no banners.
MansfieldPark	52	33653	33638	33690	Fanny	No signs that a Scottish monarch sleeps below.'" "You forget, [MASK], how lately all this has been built, and for how confined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries. It was only for the private use of the family.
MansfieldPark	56	33902	33894	33950	Fanny	"It is a pity," cried [MASK], "that the custom should have been discontinued. It was a valuable part of former times. There is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house, with one's ideas of what such a household should be!
MansfieldPark	53	36131	36085	36138	Edmund	" "Very true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me. And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son." "A very praiseworthy practice," said [MASK], "but not quite universal.
MansfieldPark	52	36506	36484	36536	Blair	How can two sermons a week, even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer [MASK]'s to his own, do all that you speak of? govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week?
MansfieldPark	57	37085	37031	37088	Each	mot_, for there is not the least wit in my nature. I am a very matter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out." A general silence succeeded. [MASK] was thoughtful.
MansfieldPark	53	37089	37089	37142	Fanny	[MASK] made the first interruption by saying, "I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood; but the next time we come to a seat, if it is not disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little while.
MansfieldPark	50	37246	37197	37247	Fanny	" "Thank you, but I am not at all tired." She took it, however, as she spoke, and the gratification of having her do so, of feeling such a connexion for the first time, made him a little forgetful of [MASK].
MansfieldPark	45	37569	37554	37599	Edmund	" "We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here," said [MASK], taking out his watch. "Do you think we are walking four miles an hour?" "Oh! do not attack me with your watch.
MansfieldPark	45	37789	37756	37801	Fanny	I am ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happen again." "_Your_ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect. [MASK]'s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me.
MansfieldPark	56	38001	37950	38006	Edmund	"I must move," said she; "resting fatigues me. I have looked across the ha-ha till I am weary. I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view, without being able to see it so well." [MASK] left the seat likewise.
MansfieldPark	42	38214	38214	38256	Edmund	[MASK] urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist, and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin's care, but with great regret that she was not stronger.
MansfieldPark	58	38424	38421	38479	Fanny	"Poor dear [MASK]," cried her cousin, "how ill you have been used by them! You had better have staid with us." Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side, she resumed the conversation which had engaged them before, and discussed the possibility of improvements with much animation.
MansfieldPark	54	38869	38864	38918	Sotherton	I_ shall ever see [MASK] again with so much pleasure as I do now. Another summer will hardly improve it to me." After a moment's embarrassment the lady replied, "You are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world.
MansfieldPark	53	38923	38880	38933	Sotherton	Another summer will hardly improve it to me." After a moment's embarrassment the lady replied, "You are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world. If other people think [MASK] improved, I have no doubt that you will.
MansfieldPark	52	39030	39028	39080	Julia	You and [MASK] were laughing the whole way." "Were we? Yes, I believe we were; but I have not the least recollection at what. Oh! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an old Irish groom of my uncle's.
MansfieldPark	56	39153	39141	39197	Julia	" "Naturally, I believe, I am as lively as [MASK], but I have more to think of now." "You have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in which very high spirits would denote insensibility. Your prospects, however, are too fair to justify want of spirits.
MansfieldPark	48	39806	39763	39811	Maria	"A pretty trick, upon my word! I cannot see them anywhere," looking eagerly into the park. "But they cannot be very far off, and I think I am equal to as much as [MASK], even without help.
MansfieldPark	54	40175	40145	40199	Julia	She felt that he had been very ill-used, and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had passed. He joined her within five minutes after [MASK]'s exit; and though she made the best of the story, he was evidently mortified and displeased in no common degree.
MansfieldPark	48	40243	40235	40283	Maria	"They desired me to stay my cousin [MASK] charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll, or thereabouts." "I do not believe I shall go any farther," said he sullenly; "I see nothing of them.
MansfieldPark	50	40316	40284	40334	Fanny	By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else. I have had walking enough." And he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by [MASK]. "I am very sorry," said she; "it is very unlucky."
MansfieldPark	48	40525	40520	40568	Fanny	" A small sigh escaped [MASK] here, and she did not know how to contradict him. "If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key, there might have been some excuse, but I went the very moment she said she wanted it.
MansfieldPark	43	40806	40794	40837	Fanny	And letting himself out, he walked off without farther ceremony. [MASK]'s thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so long ago, and getting quite impatient, she resolved to go in search of them.
MansfieldPark	52	41404	41379	41431	Fanny	By their own accounts they had been all walking after each other, and the junction which had taken place at last seemed, to [MASK]'s observation, to have been as much too late for re-establishing harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration.
MansfieldPark	58	41806	41795	41853	Maria	A pretty good day's amusement you have had!" [MASK] was just discontented enough to say directly, "I think _you_ have done pretty well yourself, ma'am. Your lap seems full of good things, and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully.
MansfieldPark	49	42027	41992	42041	Fanny	She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table, and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns. Take care of the cheese, [MASK]. Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well.
MansfieldPark	47	42904	42892	42939	Edmund	" "There is no sacrifice in the case," replied [MASK], with a serious smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; "it is entirely her own doing." "Oh yes I know it is. I was merely joking.
MansfieldPark	51	42991	42976	43027	Maria	" "My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as [MASK]'s marrying." "It is fortunate that your inclination and your father's convenience should accord so well. There is a very good living kept for you, I understand, hereabouts.
MansfieldPark	58	43052	42995	43053	Fanny	" "It is fortunate that your inclination and your father's convenience should accord so well. There is a very good living kept for you, I understand, hereabouts." "Which you suppose has biassed me?" "But _that_ I am sure it has not," cried [MASK].
MansfieldPark	48	43062	43054	43102	Fanny	"Thank you for your good word, [MASK], but it is more than I would affirm myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it should.
MansfieldPark	52	43199	43187	43239	Fanny	" "It is the same sort of thing," said [MASK], after a short pause, "as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general to be in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that.
MansfieldPark	48	43357	43331	43379	Edmund	" "But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected, you think?" said [MASK]. "To be justified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision.
MansfieldPark	56	44103	44098	44154	Henry	To own the truth, [MASK] and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose, which he could not get the better of. My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it." "I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word.
MansfieldPark	44	44193	44155	44199	Fanny	It is a great defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours. [MASK], it goes against us.
MansfieldPark	54	44804	44804	44858	Fanny	[MASK] spoke her feelings. "Here's harmony!" said she; "here's repose! Here's what may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry only can attempt to describe! Here's what may tranquillise every care, and lift the heart to rapture!
MansfieldPark	56	44926	44917	44973	Fanny	" "I like to hear your enthusiasm, [MASK]. It is a lovely night, and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree, as you do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature in early life.
MansfieldPark	44	45026	45021	45065	Cassiopeia	I wish I could see [MASK]." "We must go out on the lawn for that. Should you be afraid?" "Not in the least. It is a great while since we have had any star-gazing.
MansfieldPark	57	46014	46004	46061	Edmund	" "It is to his credit," was [MASK]'s answer; "and I dare say it gives his sister pleasure. She does not like his unsettled habits." "What a favourite he is with my cousins!" "Yes, his manners to women are such as must please.
MansfieldPark	48	47030	46987	47035	Fanny	" "It is not a settled thing, ma'am, yet. We only speak of it among friends. But I have very little doubt it _will_ be. He is growing extremely particular in his attentions." [MASK] could listen no farther.
MansfieldPark	43	47186	47152	47195	Fanny	When he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper from the table, and looking over it, said in a languid way, "If you want to dance, [MASK], I will stand up with you."
MansfieldPark	54	47427	47407	47461	Tom	I always come to you to know what I am to think of public matters." "My dear [MASK]," cried his aunt soon afterwards, "as you are not dancing, I dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber; shall you?"
MansfieldPark	57	47620	47619	47676	Fanny	" [MASK] was led off very willingly, though it was impossible for her to feel much gratitude towards her cousin, or distinguish, as he certainly did, between the selfishness of another person and his own. "A pretty modest request upon my word," he indignantly exclaimed as they walked away.
MansfieldPark	53	49896	49858	49911	Maria	It would shew great want of feeling on my father's account, absent as he is, and in some degree of constant danger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to [MASK], whose situation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely delicate.
MansfieldPark	53	50542	50492	50545	Tom	You must see the difference yourself. My father wished us, as schoolboys, to speak well, but he would never wish his grown-up daughters to be acting plays. His sense of decorum is strict." "I know all that," said [MASK], displeased.
MansfieldPark	43	50576	50546	50589	Edmund	"I know my father as well as you do; and I'll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him. Manage your own concerns, [MASK], and I'll take care of the rest of the family.
MansfieldPark	47	50664	50631	50678	Tom	It would be taking liberties with my father's house in his absence which could not be justified." "For everything of that nature I will be answerable," said [MASK], in a decided tone. "His house shall not be hurt.
MansfieldPark	52	50960	50913	50965	Edmund	Don't imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself. Don't act yourself, if you do not like it, but don't expect to govern everybody else." "No, as to acting myself," said [MASK], "_that_
MansfieldPark	55	51065	51045	51100	Fanny	Your brother's taste and your sisters' seem very different." "I have no hope there, [MASK]. If they persist in the scheme, they will find something. I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _them_, and that is all I can do.
MansfieldPark	47	51108	51067	51114	Norris	If they persist in the scheme, they will find something. I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _them_, and that is all I can do." "I should think my aunt [MASK] would be on your side.
MansfieldPark	48	51130	51115	51163	Tom	" "I dare say she would, but she has no influence with either [MASK] or my sisters that could be of any use; and if I cannot convince them myself, I shall let things take their course, without attempting it through her.
MansfieldPark	42	51227	51186	51228	Tom	" His sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning, were quite as impatient of his advice, quite as unyielding to his representation, quite as determined in the cause of pleasure, as [MASK].
MansfieldPark	51	51492	51491	51542	Edmund	And [MASK], silenced, was obliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry fascination to the mind of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to dwell more on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message than on anything else. The scheme advanced.
MansfieldPark	50	52146	52117	52167	Tom	Let us have no ranting tragedies. Too many characters. Not a tolerable woman's part in the play. Anything but _that_, my dear [MASK]. It would be impossible to fill it up. One could not expect anybody to take such a part.
MansfieldPark	47	53100	53083	53130	Agatha	"It falls as naturally, as necessarily to her," said he, "as [MASK] does to one or other of my sisters. It can be no sacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic." A short silence followed.
MansfieldPark	47	53143	53110	53157	Agatha	It can be no sacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic." A short silence followed. Each sister looked anxious; for each felt the best claim to [MASK], and was hoping to have it pressed on her by the rest.
MansfieldPark	54	53207	53194	53248	Agatha	," said he, "not to engage in the part of [MASK], or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity. You must not, indeed you must not" (turning to her). "I could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness.
MansfieldPark	53	53263	53220	53273	Frederick	You must not, indeed you must not" (turning to her). "I could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness. The many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me, and [MASK] and his knapsack would be obliged to run away.
MansfieldPark	55	53381	53380	53435	Julia	Though [MASK] fancies she prefers tragedy, I would not trust her in it. There is nothing of tragedy about her. She has not the look of it. Her features are not tragic features, and she walks too quick, and speaks too quick, and would not keep her countenance.
MansfieldPark	51	53454	53436	53487	Julia	She had better do the old countrywoman: the Cottager's wife; you had, indeed, [MASK]. Cottager's wife is a very pretty part, I assure you. The old lady relieves the high-flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit.
MansfieldPark	56	53637	53582	53638	Julia	You do not deserve the office, if you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better." "Why, as to _that_, my good friend, till I and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement to [MASK].
MansfieldPark	54	53862	53860	53914	Amelia	I consider [MASK] is the most difficult character in the whole piece. It requires great powers, great nicety, to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance. I have seen good actresses fail in the part. Simplicity, indeed, is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession.
MansfieldPark	41	54020	53991	54032	Amelia	It is not at all the part for her. She would not like it. She would not do well. She is too tall and robust. [MASK] should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure.
MansfieldPark	52	54165	54145	54197	Julia	I think I see you coming in with your basket." The influence of his voice was felt. [MASK] wavered; but was he only trying to soothe and pacify her, and make her overlook the previous affront? She distrusted him. The slight had been most determined.
MansfieldPark	55	54303	54257	54312	Agatha	With hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she said to him, "You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come in with a basket of provisions though one might have supposed but it is only as [MASK] that I was to be so overpowering!"
MansfieldPark	57	54472	54445	54502	Fanny	And so saying, she walked hastily out of the room, leaving awkward feelings to more than one, but exciting small compassion in any except [MASK], who had been a quiet auditor of the whole, and who could not think of her as under the agitations of _jealousy_ without great pity.
MansfieldPark	42	55559	55522	55564	Edmund	That's something, is not it? But I do not much like the idea of being so fine. I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak." [MASK] could not answer him.
MansfieldPark	52	55737	55686	55738	Maria	Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt, and see how you can approve it. It will not be necessary to send you to your _father's_ judgment, I am convinced." "We see things very differently," cried [MASK].
MansfieldPark	47	56178	56172	56219	Edmund	" "What!" cried [MASK], "if she knew your reasons!" "Oh! she might think the difference between us the difference in our situations that _she_ need not be so scrupulous as _I_ might feel necessary.
MansfieldPark	53	56254	56220	56273	Tom	I am sure she would argue so. No; you must excuse me; I cannot retract my consent; it is too far settled, everybody would be so disappointed, [MASK] would be quite angry; and if we are so very nice, we shall never act anything.
MansfieldPark	49	56512	56473	56522	Tom	I _am_ of some use, I hope, in preventing waste and making the most of things. There should always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones. I forgot to tell [MASK] of something that happened to me this very day.
MansfieldPark	53	56802	56764	56817	Edmund	I hate such greediness so good as your father is to the family, employing the man all the year round!" Nobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others soon returned; and [MASK] found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his only satisfaction.
MansfieldPark	43	57378	57336	57379	Anhalt	What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to?" For a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together to tell the same melancholy truth, that they had not yet got any [MASK].
MansfieldPark	42	57725	57719	57761	Anhalt	What shall we do for an [MASK]? Is it practicable for any of the others to double it? What is your advice?" "My advice," said he calmly, "is that you change the play.
MansfieldPark	41	57865	57846	57887	Anhalt	"If _any_ part could tempt _you_ to act, I suppose it would be [MASK]," observed the lady archly, after a short pause; "for he is a clergyman, you know.
MansfieldPark	41	57927	57920	57961	Anhalt	It must be very difficult to keep [MASK] from appearing a formal, solemn lecturer; and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps, one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage.
MansfieldPark	46	58114	58108	58154	Fanny	" "Me!" cried [MASK], sitting down again with a most frightened look. "Indeed you must excuse me. I could not act anything if you were to give me the world. No, indeed, I cannot act.
MansfieldPark	50	58284	58268	58318	Fanny	" "It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart," said [MASK], shocked to find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room, and to feel that almost every eye was upon her; "but I really cannot act.
MansfieldPark	49	58359	58335	58384	Cottager	Learn your part, and we will teach you all the rest. You have only two scenes, and as I shall be [MASK], I'll put you in and push you about, and you will do it very well, I'll answer for it.
MansfieldPark	47	58732	58721	58768	Edmund	" "Do not urge her, madam," said [MASK]. "It is not fair to urge her in this manner. You see she does not like to act. Let her chuse for herself, as well as the rest of us.
MansfieldPark	43	59028	58988	59031	Edmund	By a look at her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board, and the really good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in [MASK]'s favour.
MansfieldPark	49	59737	59709	59758	Tom	When the evening was over, she went to bed full of it, her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attack from her cousin [MASK], so public and so persevered in, and her spirits sinking under her aunt's unkind reflection and reproach.
MansfieldPark	53	60322	60294	60347	Fanny	The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable in many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind as [MASK]'s; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be driven from it entirely, even when winter came.
MansfieldPark	45	61046	61020	61065	Tom	The table between the windows was covered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which had been given her at different times, principally by [MASK]; and she grew bewildered as to the amount of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced.
MansfieldPark	56	61121	61066	61122	Edmund	A tap at the door roused her in the midst of this attempt to find her way to her duty, and her gentle "Come in" was answered by the appearance of one, before whom all her doubts were wont to be laid. Her eyes brightened at the sight of [MASK].
MansfieldPark	55	61130	61123	61178	Fanny	"Can I speak with you, [MASK], for a few minutes?" said he. "Yes, certainly." "I want to consult. I want your opinion." "My opinion!" she cried, shrinking from such a compliment, highly as it gratified her.
MansfieldPark	49	61981	61933	61982	Fanny	" "But still it has not your approbation. Can you mention any other measure by which I have a chance of doing equal good?" "No, I cannot think of anything else." "Give me your approbation, then, [MASK].
MansfieldPark	41	62019	62012	62053	Tom	But it is absolutely impossible to let [MASK] go on in this way, riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act no matter whom: the look of a gentleman is to be enough.
MansfieldPark	55	62090	62069	62124	Fanny	" "No doubt she will be very glad. It must be a great relief to her," said [MASK], trying for greater warmth of manner. "She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night. It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill.
MansfieldPark	52	62163	62114	62166	Edmund	It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill." "She _was_ very kind, indeed, and I am glad to have her spared"... She could not finish the generous effusion. Her conscience stopt her in the middle, but [MASK] was satisfied.
MansfieldPark	53	62193	62189	62242	Fanny	And now, dear [MASK], I will not interrupt you any longer. You want to be reading. But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you, and come to a decision. Sleeping or waking, my head has been full of this matter all night.
MansfieldPark	43	62261	62260	62303	Tom	If [MASK] is up, I shall go to him directly and get it over, and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good-humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity. _
MansfieldPark	50	62497	62456	62506	Edmund	To be acting! After all his objections objections so just and so public! After all that she had heard him say, and seen him look, and known him to be feeling. Could it be possible? [MASK] so inconsistent! Was he not deceiving himself?
MansfieldPark	59	62641	62637	62696	Edmund	Such a victory over [MASK]'s discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was most delightful. There was no longer anything to disturb them in their darling project, and they congratulated each other in private on the jealous weakness to which they attributed the change, with all the glee of feelings gratified in every way.
MansfieldPark	48	62697	62697	62745	Edmund	[MASK] might still look grave, and say he did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play in particular; their point was gained: he was to act, and he was driven to it by the force of selfish inclinations only.
MansfieldPark	51	62868	62851	62902	Edmund	A stranger among them would have been the destruction of all their comfort"; and when [MASK], pursuing that idea, gave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were ready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything.
MansfieldPark	50	63007	62976	63026	Fanny	" "No, she is quite determined. She certainly will not act." "Oh! very well." And not another word was said; but [MASK] felt herself again in danger, and her indifference to the danger was beginning to fail her already.
MansfieldPark	47	63267	63239	63286	Edmund	She could not feel that she had done wrong herself, but she was disquieted in every other way. Her heart and her judgment were equally against [MASK]'s decision: she could not acquit his unsteadiness, and his happiness under it made her wretched.
MansfieldPark	48	63472	63439	63487	Fanny	_ good-nature had honourable mention; her taste and her time were considered; her presence was wanted; she was sought for, and attended, and praised; and [MASK] was at first in some danger of envying her the character she had accepted.
MansfieldPark	58	64415	64362	64420	Henry	" "If you have such a suspicion, something must be done; and as soon as the play is all over, we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind; and if he means nothing, we will send him off, though he is [MASK], for a time.
MansfieldPark	55	65780	65780	65835	Fanny	[MASK], in her pity and kindheartedness, was at great pains to teach him how to learn, giving him all the helps and directions in her power, trying to make an artificial memory for him, and learning every word of his part herself, but without his being much the forwarder.
MansfieldPark	42	66240	66220	66262	Fanny	you have never told me." "Oh! sister, pray do not ask her now; for [MASK] is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time. It is about Lovers' Vows.
MansfieldPark	42	66733	66732	66774	Fanny	" [MASK], quite surprised, endeavoured to shew herself mistress of the room by her civilities, and looked at the bright bars of her empty grate with concern. "Thank you; I am quite warm, very warm.
MansfieldPark	43	69273	69234	69277	Edmund	She was nearly fainting: all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning, and with it compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the development before him, with solicitude on [MASK]'s account indescribable.
MansfieldPark	46	70366	70340	70386	Pug	She had been _almost_ fluttered for a few minutes, and still remained so sensibly animated as to put away her work, move [MASK] from her side, and give all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband.
MansfieldPark	47	71088	71075	71122	Tom	" "The _all_ will soon be told," cried [MASK] hastily, and with affected unconcern; "but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now. You will hear enough of it to-morrow, sir.
MansfieldPark	43	71403	71375	71418	Edmund	He was gone before anything had been said to prepare him for the change he must find there; and a pause of alarm followed his disappearance. [MASK] was the first to speak "Something must be done," said he.
MansfieldPark	44	73036	73028	73072	Tom	Do you find them agreeable acquaintance?" [MASK] was the only one at all ready with an answer, but he being entirely without particular regard for either, without jealousy either in love or acting, could speak very handsomely of both.
MansfieldPark	59	73625	73567	73626	Fanny	He was anxious, while vindicating himself, to say nothing unkind of the others: but there was only one amongst them whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of defence or palliation. "We have all been more or less to blame," said he, "every one of us, excepting [MASK].
MansfieldPark	41	73627	73627	73668	Fanny	[MASK] is the only one who has judged rightly throughout; who has been consistent. _Her_ feelings have been steadily against it from first to last. She never ceased to think of what was due to you.
MansfieldPark	59	74427	74369	74428	Michaelmas	I thought we should never have got through them, though we had the four horses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his great love and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since [MASK].
MansfieldPark	58	76000	75992	76050	Tom	" It was well at that moment that [MASK] had to speak, and not his sister. He could immediately say with easy fluency, "I am sorry you are going; but as to our play, _that_ is all over entirely at an end" (looking significantly at his father).
MansfieldPark	51	76532	76497	76548	Edmund	She heard it at dinner, and felt it a blessing. By all the others it was mentioned with regret; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling from the sincerity of [MASK]'s too partial regard, to the unconcern of his mother speaking entirely by rote.
MansfieldPark	52	77012	77004	77056	Fanny	"But they," he observed to [MASK], "have a claim. They seem to belong to us; they seem to be part of ourselves. I could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away.
MansfieldPark	56	77139	77090	77146	Tom	If he knew them better, he would value their society as it deserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like. We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves: my sisters seem out of spirits, and [MASK] is certainly not at his ease.
MansfieldPark	50	77178	77169	77219	Fanny	" "Do you think so?" said [MASK]: "in my opinion, my uncle would not like _any_ addition. I think he values the very quietness you speak of, and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants.
MansfieldPark	45	77352	77345	77390	Fanny	"I believe you are right, [MASK]," was his reply, after a short consideration. "I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were, than assuming a new character. The novelty was in their being lively.
MansfieldPark	49	77431	77383	77432	Fanny	The novelty was in their being lively. Yet, how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give! I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before." "I suppose I am graver than other people," said [MASK].
MansfieldPark	52	77542	77502	77554	Fanny	(smiling). "Do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet? But when did you, or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, [MASK]? Go to my father if you want to be complimented.
MansfieldPark	57	77611	77560	77617	Fanny	Ask your uncle what he thinks, and you will hear compliments enough: and though they may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it, and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time." Such language was so new to [MASK] that it quite embarrassed her.
MansfieldPark	49	77705	77686	77735	Fanny	Your complexion is so improved! and you have gained so much countenance! and your figure nay, [MASK], do not turn away about it it is but an uncle. If you cannot bear an uncle's admiration, what is to become of you?
MansfieldPark	47	78241	78207	78254	Fanny	I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side." "She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you," said [MASK], with half a sigh, "to have any such apprehension.
MansfieldPark	49	78664	78646	78695	Maria	He had expected a very different son-in-law; and beginning to feel grave on [MASK]'s account, tried to understand _her_ feelings. Little observation there was necessary to tell him that indifference was the most favourable state they could be in.
MansfieldPark	46	78838	78829	78875	Maria	He would act for her and release her. [MASK] had a moment's struggle as she listened, and only a moment's: when her father ceased, she was able to give her answer immediately, decidedly, and with no apparent agitation.
MansfieldPark	57	80340	80293	80350	Fanny	Even their mother missed them; and how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered about the house, and thought of them, and felt for them, with a degree of affectionate regret which they had never done much to deserve! CHAPTER XXII [MASK]'s consequence increased on the departure of her cousins.
MansfieldPark	54	81301	81291	81345	Fanny	" "But they are passed over," said [MASK]. "I have been watching them. This weather is all from the south." "South or north, I know a black cloud when I see it; and you must not set forward while it is so threatening.
MansfieldPark	50	81364	81318	81368	Edmund	" "South or north, I know a black cloud when I see it; and you must not set forward while it is so threatening. And besides, I want to play something more to you a very pretty piece and your cousin [MASK]'s prime favourite.
MansfieldPark	41	81801	81791	81832	Fanny	"This is pretty, very pretty," said [MASK], looking around her as they were thus sitting together one day; "every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty.
MansfieldPark	42	82550	82525	82567	Fanny	But then," with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice, "there is no saying what it may lead to." [MASK]'s heart beat quick, and she felt quite unequal to surmising or soliciting anything more.
MansfieldPark	50	83005	82985	83035	Edmund	It just stands for a gentleman, and that's all. But there is nobleness in the name of [MASK]. It is a name of heroism and renown; of kings, princes, and knights; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections.
MansfieldPark	54	83193	83154	83208	Fanny	A friendship between two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished: and to the credit of the lover's understanding, be it stated, that he did not by any means consider [MASK] as the only, or even as the greater gainer by such a friendship.
MansfieldPark	52	83338	83331	83383	Edmund	" "And really," added [MASK], "the day is so mild, that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent. Our weather must not always be judged by the calendar. We may sometimes take greater liberties in November than in May.
MansfieldPark	59	83823	83809	83868	Mary	" "Thank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations, [MASK], live where we may; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you, I dare say I shall find you with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer, perhaps on their very account.
MansfieldPark	42	84579	84569	84611	Edmund	With undoubting decision she directly began her adieus; and [MASK] began at the same time to recollect that his mother had been inquiring for her, and that he had walked down to the Parsonage on purpose to bring her back.
MansfieldPark	45	85321	85308	85353	Fanny	" "If you cannot do without me, ma'am " said [MASK], in a self-denying tone. "But my mother will have my father with her all the evening." "To be sure, so I shall.
MansfieldPark	49	85378	85330	85379	Edmund	"But my mother will have my father with her all the evening." "To be sure, so I shall." "Suppose you take my father's opinion, ma'am." "That's well thought of. So I will, [MASK].
MansfieldPark	58	85637	85632	85690	Fanny	Her story began; and [MASK] immediately slipped out of the room; for to hear herself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her nerves could bear. She was anxious, she knew more anxious perhaps than she ought to be for what was it after all whether she went or staid?
MansfieldPark	51	85987	85987	86038	Fanny	[MASK] was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer. She appears to feel as she ought. But as I conclude that she must wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence.
MansfieldPark	50	86182	86163	86213	Fanny	You are to go." "Thank you, I am _so_ glad," was [MASK]'s instinctive reply; though when she had turned from him and shut the door, she could not help feeling, "And yet why should I be glad?
MansfieldPark	54	86853	86826	86880	Fanny	and how much more he would have been respected! for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere. Remember that, [MASK]. Five only five to be sitting round that table. However, you will have dinner enough on it for ten, I dare say.
MansfieldPark	49	87396	87389	87438	Fanny	" But this could not impose on [MASK]. She felt that the carriage was for herself, and herself alone: and her uncle's consideration of her, coming immediately after such representations from her aunt, cost her some tears of gratitude when she was alone.
MansfieldPark	43	87694	87671	87714	Edmund	" In approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable-yard and coach-house. "Heyday!" said [MASK], "here's company, here's a carriage! who have they got to meet us?"
MansfieldPark	52	87787	87776	87828	Fanny	" There was no occasion, there was no time for [MASK] to say how very differently she felt; but the idea of having such another to observe her was a great increase of the trepidation with which she performed the very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing-room.
MansfieldPark	45	88219	88194	88239	Maria	She could not wish him to stay, and would much rather not have him speak to her. Her two absent cousins, especially [MASK], were much in her thoughts on seeing him; but no embarrassing remembrance affected _his_ spirits.
MansfieldPark	54	88519	88500	88554	Maria	I see him now his toil and his despair. Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely [MASK] will ever want him to make two-and-forty speeches to her"; adding, with a momentary seriousness, "She is too good for him much too good."
MansfieldPark	50	88666	88634	88684	Fanny	He_ might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness, but I may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party." [MASK] coloured, and said nothing. "It is as a dream, a pleasant dream!"
MansfieldPark	57	88779	88753	88810	Fanny	Always some little objection, some little doubt, some little anxiety to be got over. I never was happier." With silent indignation [MASK] repeated to herself, "Never happier! never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable! never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly!
MansfieldPark	46	88971	88962	89008	Fanny	" He seemed determined to be answered; and [MASK], averting her face, said, with a firmer tone than usual, "As far as _I_ am concerned, sir, I would not have delayed his return for a day.
MansfieldPark	51	89256	89231	89282	Bertram	I find he takes orders in a few weeks. They were at it in the dining-parlour. I am glad to hear [MASK] will be so well off. He will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with, and earned without much trouble.
MansfieldPark	50	89396	89390	89440	Henry	You would look rather blank, [MASK], if your _menus_ _plaisirs_ were to be limited to seven hundred a year." "Perhaps I might; but all _that_ you know is entirely comparative. Birthright and habit must settle the business.
MansfieldPark	51	89441	89404	89455	Bertram	plaisirs_ were to be limited to seven hundred a year." "Perhaps I might; but all _that_ you know is entirely comparative. Birthright and habit must settle the business. [MASK] is certainly well off for a cadet of even a baronet's family.
MansfieldPark	48	89873	89860	89908	Edmund	With that she soothed herself and amused her friend. The assurance of [MASK]'s being so soon to take orders, coming upon her like a blow that had been suspended, and still hoped uncertain and at a distance, was felt with resentment and mortification.
MansfieldPark	46	90953	90941	90987	Henry	" "It can be but for a fortnight," said [MASK]; "and if a fortnight can kill her, she must have a constitution which nothing could save. No, I will not do her any harm, dear little soul!
MansfieldPark	43	91081	91069	91112	Mary	I want nothing more." "Moderation itself!" said [MASK]. "I can have no scruples now. Well, you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself, for we are a great deal together."
MansfieldPark	43	92886	92886	92929	Fanny	[MASK]'s attractions increased increased twofold; for the sensibility which beautified her complexion and illumined her countenance was an attraction in itself. He was no longer in doubt of the capabilities of her heart. She had feeling, genuine feeling.
MansfieldPark	55	92973	92930	92985	William	It would be something to be loved by such a girl, to excite the first ardours of her young unsophisticated mind! She interested him more than he had foreseen. A fortnight was not enough. His stay became indefinite. [MASK] was often called on by his uncle to be the talker.
MansfieldPark	52	93380	93362	93414	Edmund	He was roused from the reverie of retrospection and regret produced by it, by some inquiry from [MASK] as to his plans for the next day's hunting; and he found it was as well to be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command.
MansfieldPark	55	95216	95211	95266	Edmund	"Well," continued [MASK], "and how did you like what you saw?" "Very much indeed. You are a lucky fellow. There will be work for five summers at least before the place is liveable." "No, no, not so bad as that.
MansfieldPark	49	95884	95836	95885	Bertram	The place deserves it, and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of. (Excuse me, your ladyship must not see your cards. There, let them lie just before you.) The place deserves it, [MASK].
MansfieldPark	58	97676	97674	97732	Crawford	But, [MASK], though I refuse you as a tenant, come to me as a friend. Consider the house as half your own every winter, and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan, and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring.
MansfieldPark	57	98580	98575	98632	William	But never mind it, [MASK]" (her own cheeks in a glow of indignation as she spoke). "It is not worth minding. It is no reflection on _you_; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced, more or less, in their time.
MansfieldPark	54	98756	98750	98804	William	" "Oh! my dear [MASK], do not talk so; do not be so desponding. My uncle says nothing, but I am sure he will do everything in his power to get you made. He knows, as well as you do, of what consequence it is.
MansfieldPark	52	98844	98805	98857	Fanny	" She was checked by the sight of her uncle much nearer to them than she had any suspicion of, and each found it necessary to talk of something else. "Are you fond of dancing, [MASK]?" "Yes, very; only I am soon tired.
MansfieldPark	45	99079	99075	99120	Fanny	I have never seen [MASK] dance since she was a little girl; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her, which, perhaps, we may have an opportunity of doing ere long.
MansfieldPark	48	100402	100355	100403	Fanny	The ball was now a settled thing, and before the evening a proclaimed thing to all whom it concerned. Invitations were sent with despatch, and many a young lady went to bed that night with her head full of happy cares as well as [MASK].
MansfieldPark	54	100537	100537	100591	William	[MASK] had wanted to buy her a gold chain too, but the purchase had been beyond his means, and therefore not to wear the cross might be mortifying him. These were anxious considerations; enough to sober her spirits even under the prospect of a ball given principally for her gratification.
MansfieldPark	59	101360	101334	101393	Edmund	Was there not a "yes" in all this? With such matters to ponder over, and arrange, and re-arrange, [MASK] could not, on his own account, think very much of the evening which the rest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of strong interest.
MansfieldPark	41	101790	101783	101824	Fanny	It was just the plan to suit [MASK]; and with a great deal of gratitude on her side for such ready and kind attention, they proceeded indoors, and upstairs, and were soon deep in the interesting subject.
MansfieldPark	54	101917	101917	101971	Fanny	[MASK] acknowledged her wishes and doubts on this point: she did not know how either to wear the cross, or to refrain from wearing it. She was answered by having a small trinket-box placed before her, and being requested to chuse from among several gold chains and necklaces.
MansfieldPark	41	102094	102067	102108	Fanny	I do not offer them as new. I offer nothing but an old necklace. You must forgive the liberty, and oblige me." [MASK] still resisted, and from her heart. The gift was too valuable.
MansfieldPark	50	102298	102298	102348	Fanny	[MASK] had not a word to say against its becomingness, and, excepting what remained of her scruples, was exceedingly pleased with an acquisition so very apropos. She would rather, perhaps, have been obliged to some other person. But this was an unworthy feeling.
MansfieldPark	48	102417	102412	102460	Henry	"You must think of [MASK], for it was his choice in the first place. He gave it to me, and with the necklace I make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver. It is to be a family remembrancer.
MansfieldPark	48	102477	102461	102509	Fanny	The sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too." [MASK], in great astonishment and confusion, would have returned the present instantly. To take what had been the gift of another person, of a brother too, impossible!
MansfieldPark	58	102581	102578	102636	Henry	Do you think [MASK] will claim the necklace as mine, and fancy you did not come honestly by it? or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago, before he knew there was such a throat in the world?
MansfieldPark	51	103089	103084	103135	Fanny	CHAPTER XXVII On reaching home [MASK] went immediately upstairs to deposit this unexpected acquisition, this doubtful good of a necklace, in some favourite box in the East room, which held all her smaller treasures; but on opening the door, what was her surprise to find her cousin
MansfieldPark	49	103161	103143	103192	Fanny	Such a sight having never occurred before, was almost as wonderful as it was welcome. "[MASK]," said he directly, leaving his seat and his pen, and meeting her with something in his hand, "I beg your pardon for being here.
MansfieldPark	57	103314	103305	103362	Fanny	I hope you will like the chain itself, [MASK]. I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste; but, at any rate, I know you will be kind to my intentions, and consider it, as it really is, a token of the love of one of your oldest friends.
MansfieldPark	51	103374	103364	103415	Fanny	And so saying, he was hurrying away, before [MASK], overpowered by a thousand feelings of pain and pleasure, could attempt to speak; but quickened by one sovereign wish, she then called out, "Oh! cousin, stop a moment, pray stop!"
MansfieldPark	49	103480	103447	103496	Fanny	I feel much more than I can possibly express. Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond " "If that is all you have to say, [MASK]" smiling and turning away again. "No, no, it is not.
MansfieldPark	47	103629	103593	103640	Fanny	They must and shall be worn together. It comes, too, in such an acceptable moment. Oh, cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is." "My dear [MASK], you feel these things a great deal too much.
MansfieldPark	50	103937	103933	103983	Fanny	No, my dear [MASK], upon no account. It would be mortifying her severely. There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend.
MansfieldPark	57	104159	104112	104169	William	No doubt it is handsomer than mine, and fitter for a ballroom." "No, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer in its way, and, for my purpose, not half so fit. The chain will agree with [MASK]'s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace.
MansfieldPark	47	104176	104170	104217	Fanny	" "For one night, [MASK], for only one night, if it _be_ a sacrifice; I am sure you will, upon consideration, make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort.
MansfieldPark	49	104438	104397	104446	Fanny	I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise," he repeated, his voice sinking a little, "between the two dearest objects I have on earth." He was gone as he spoke; and [MASK] remained to tranquillise herself as she could.
MansfieldPark	48	105039	104996	105044	Edmund	The enthusiasm of a woman's love is even beyond the biographer's. To her, the handwriting itself, independent of anything it may convey, is a blessedness. Never were such characters cut by any other human being as [MASK]'s commonest handwriting gave!
MansfieldPark	48	105082	105045	105093	Fanny	This specimen, written in haste as it was, had not a fault; and there was a felicity in the flow of the first four words, in the arrangement of "My very dear [MASK]," which she could have looked at for ever.
MansfieldPark	48	105128	105094	105142	Bertram	Having regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings by this happy mixture of reason and weakness, she was able in due time to go down and resume her usual employments near her aunt [MASK], and pay her the usual observances without any apparent want of spirits.
MansfieldPark	43	105471	105451	105494	Fanny	The Admiral, he believed, had interest. Upon the whole, it was a very joyous note. [MASK]'s spirits lived on it half the morning, deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to go away.
MansfieldPark	58	105938	105911	105969	Edmund	As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday; it had been about the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage, and found [MASK] in the East room. "Suppose I were to find him there again to-day!" said she to herself, in a fond indulgence of fancy.
MansfieldPark	54	105971	105944	105998	Fanny	"Suppose I were to find him there again to-day!" said she to herself, in a fond indulgence of fancy. "[MASK]," said a voice at that moment near her. Starting and looking up, she saw, across the lobby she had just reached,
MansfieldPark	48	106023	106016	106064	Fanny	"You look tired and fagged, [MASK]. You have been walking too far." "No, I have not been out at all." "Then you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse. You had better have gone out.
MansfieldPark	53	106066	106065	106118	Fanny	" [MASK], not liking to complain, found it easiest to make no answer; and though he looked at her with his usual kindness, she believed he had soon ceased to think of her countenance. He did not appear in spirits: something unconnected with her was probably amiss.
MansfieldPark	52	106353	106352	106404	Fanny	" [MASK] struggled for speech, and said, "I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you. This ought to be a day of pleasure. My uncle meant it so." "Oh yes, yes! and it will be a day of pleasure.
MansfieldPark	52	106442	106440	106492	Fanny	But, [MASK]," stopping her, by taking her hand, and speaking low and seriously, "you know what all this means. You see how it is; and could tell me, perhaps better than I could tell you, how and why I am vexed.
MansfieldPark	45	106611	106568	106613	Fanny	She does not _think_ evil, but she speaks it, speaks it in playfulness; and though I know it to be playfulness, it grieves me to the soul." "The effect of education," said [MASK] gently.
MansfieldPark	41	106640	106622	106663	Fanny	"Yes, that uncle and aunt! They have injured the finest mind; for sometimes, [MASK], I own to you, it does appear more than manner: it appears as if the mind itself was tainted.
MansfieldPark	52	106665	106664	106716	Fanny	" [MASK] imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment, and therefore, after a moment's consideration, said, "If you only want me as a listener, cousin, I will be as useful as I can; but I am not qualified for an adviser.
MansfieldPark	53	107031	106998	107051	Fanny	You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said; but you have always known my opinion of her; you can bear me witness, [MASK], that I have never been blinded. How many a time have we talked over her little errors!
MansfieldPark	49	107114	107108	107157	Fanny	He had said enough to give [MASK] some happier feelings than she had lately known, and with a brighter look, she answered, "Yes, cousin, I am convinced that _you_ would be incapable of anything else, though perhaps some might not.
MansfieldPark	56	107325	107325	107381	William	[MASK]'s good fortune returned again upon her mind, and seemed of greater value than at first. The ball, too such an evening of pleasure before her! It was now a real animation; and she began to dress for it with much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball.
MansfieldPark	55	107632	107622	107677	Fanny	It had really occurred to her, unprompted, that [MASK], preparing for a ball, might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid's, and when dressed herself, she actually sent her own maid to assist her; too late, of course, to be of any use.
MansfieldPark	47	107739	107724	107771	Fanny	CHAPTER XXVIII Her uncle and both her aunts were in the drawing-room when [MASK] went down. To the former she was an interesting object, and he saw with pleasure the general elegance of her appearance, and her being in remarkably good looks.
MansfieldPark	53	109518	109511	109564	Fanny	It was rather honour than happiness to [MASK], for the first dance at least: her partner was in excellent spirits, and tried to impart them to her; but she was a great deal too much frightened to have any enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer looked at.
MansfieldPark	48	110573	110540	110588	Fanny	"I am worn out with civility," said he. "I have been talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say. But with _you_, [MASK], there may be peace. You will not want to be talked to.
MansfieldPark	46	110774	110746	110792	Fanny	They had talked, and they had been silent; he had reasoned, she had ridiculed; and they had parted at last with mutual vexation. [MASK], not able to refrain entirely from observing them, had seen enough to be tolerably satisfied.
MansfieldPark	47	111053	111028	111075	Fanny	" "What! Did she think of being up before you set off?" "Oh! yes, sir," cried [MASK], rising eagerly from her seat to be nearer her uncle; "I must get up and breakfast with him.
MansfieldPark	52	111346	111325	111377	William	His niece, meanwhile, did not thank him for what he had just done. She had hoped to have [MASK] all to herself the last morning. It would have been an unspeakable indulgence. But though her wishes were overthrown, there was no spirit of murmuring within her.
MansfieldPark	54	111806	111777	111831	William	She sat and cried _con_ _amore_ as her uncle intended, but it was _con_ _amore_ fraternal and no other. [MASK] was gone, and she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit in idle cares and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him.
MansfieldPark	54	111961	111940	111994	Bertram	Nothing remained of last night but remembrances, which she had nobody to share in. She talked to her aunt [MASK] she must talk to somebody of the ball; but her aunt had seen so little of what had passed, and had so little curiosity, that it was heavy work.
MansfieldPark	42	112245	112229	112271	Fanny	"I feel quite stupid. It must be sitting up so late last night. [MASK], you must do something to keep me awake. I cannot work. Fetch the cards; I feel so very stupid."
MansfieldPark	45	112997	112995	113040	Fanny	We shew [MASK] what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face, she is now a very valuable companion. If we have been kind to _her_, she is now quite as necessary to _us_.
MansfieldPark	43	113304	113303	113346	Mary	To [MASK] it was every way painful. She felt the want of his society every day, almost every hour, and was too much in want of it to derive anything but irritation from considering the object for which he went.
MansfieldPark	51	113995	113956	114007	Fanny	Being the only young person at home, I consider _you_ as the greatest sufferer. You must miss him. Does his staying longer surprise you?" "I do not know," said [MASK] hesitatingly. "Yes; I had not particularly expected it.
MansfieldPark	47	114614	114583	114630	Mansfield	Never did tone express indifference plainer. Indeed, how can one care for those one has never seen? Well, when your cousin comes back, he will find [MASK] very quiet; all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine and myself.
MansfieldPark	55	115070	115032	115087	Fanny	But I dare say you know exactly I always imagine you are perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all or not at present." "No, I do not," said [MASK] softly, hoping she did not err either in the belief or the acknowledgment of it.
MansfieldPark	52	115542	115521	115573	Mary	The conviction of his determination once admitted, it was not unwelcome. There was even pleasure with the surprise. [MASK] was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with the Bertram family, and to be not displeased with her brother's marrying a little beneath him.
MansfieldPark	46	115640	115609	115655	Mary	I have, I flatter myself, made no inconsiderable progress in her affections; but my own are entirely fixed." "Lucky, lucky girl!" cried [MASK], as soon as she could speak; "what a match for her!
MansfieldPark	49	115658	115656	115705	Henry	My dearest [MASK], this must be my _first_ feeling; but my _second_, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your choice from my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it.
MansfieldPark	51	116032	115987	116038	Mary	She is the very impossibility he would describe, if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas. But till it is absolutely settled settled beyond all interference, he shall know nothing of the matter. No, [MASK], you are quite mistaken.
MansfieldPark	52	116220	116186	116238	Mary	What are your plans? Does she know her own happiness?" "No." "What are you waiting for?" "For for very little more than opportunity. [MASK], she is not like her cousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain.
MansfieldPark	59	116405	116349	116408	Fanny	" As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence, he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeply interesting to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing to relate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on but [MASK]'s charms.
MansfieldPark	50	116511	116483	116533	Edmund	Her temper he had good reason to depend on and to praise. He had often seen it tried. Was there one of the family, excepting [MASK], who had not in some way or other continually exercised her patience and forbearance? Her affections were evidently strong.
MansfieldPark	51	117172	117170	117221	Henry	My dearest [MASK], the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his, before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions, or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life!
MansfieldPark	53	117336	117294	117347	Fanny	The Admiral has his faults, but he is a very good man, and has been more than a father to me. Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much. You must not prejudice [MASK] against him. I must have them love one another.
MansfieldPark	52	118375	118336	118388	Fanny	I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother's promotion. Here are the letters which announce it, this moment come to hand. You will, perhaps, like to see them." [MASK] could not speak, but he did not want her to speak.
MansfieldPark	47	119002	118987	119034	Fanny	" "Has this been all _your_ doing, then?" cried [MASK]. "Good heaven! how very, very kind! Have you really was it by _your_ desire? I beg your pardon, but I am bewildered.
MansfieldPark	46	119306	119303	119349	William	Dearest, dearest [MASK]!" She jumped up and moved in haste towards the door, crying out, "I will go to my uncle. My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible." But this could not be suffered.
MansfieldPark	49	119804	119793	119842	William	I can hear no more of this. Your kindness to [MASK] makes me more obliged to you than words can express; but I do not want, I cannot bear, I must not listen to such No, no, don't think of me.
MansfieldPark	48	120108	120079	120127	William	She would not have him be serious, and yet what could excuse the use of such words and offers, if they meant but to trifle? But [MASK] was a lieutenant. _That_ was a fact beyond a doubt, and without an alloy.
MansfieldPark	53	120597	120557	120610	Fanny	Price_ for at least the last six weeks I cannot let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general congratulation, and giving my most joyful consent and approval. Go on, my dear [MASK], and without fear; there can be no difficulties worth naming.
MansfieldPark	50	121665	121622	121672	Fanny	And farther, how could it be supposed that his sister, with all her high and worldly notions of matrimony, would be forwarding anything of a serious nature in such a quarter? Nothing could be more unnatural in either. [MASK] was ashamed of her own doubts.
MansfieldPark	53	121936	121904	121957	Fanny	She will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you. Pray write to her, if it be only a line." "Oh yes! certainly," cried [MASK], rising in haste, the haste of embarrassment and of wanting to get away "I will write directly.
MansfieldPark	53	123239	123237	123290	Norris	Your aunt [MASK] has always been an advocate, and very judiciously, for young people's being brought up without unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation in everything. She is also very hardy herself, which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others.
MansfieldPark	59	123367	123342	123401	Fanny	I am aware that there has been sometimes, in some points, a misplaced distinction; but I think too well of you, [MASK], to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that account. You have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part, and judging partially by the event.
MansfieldPark	43	123517	123496	123539	Norris	I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you, by failing at any time to treat your aunt [MASK] with the respect and attention that are due to her. But enough of this. Sit down, my dear.
MansfieldPark	56	124228	124196	124252	Fanny	But now, when he has made his overtures so properly, and honourably what are your scruples _now_?" "You are mistaken, sir," cried [MASK], forced by the anxiety of the moment even to tell her uncle that he was wrong; "you are quite mistaken.
MansfieldPark	53	124630	124579	124632	William	His sister, moreover, is your intimate friend, and he has been doing _that_ for your brother, which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you, had there been no other. It is very uncertain when my interest might have got [MASK] on.
MansfieldPark	55	124769	124725	124780	Fanny	You must have observed his attentions; and though you always received them very properly (I have no accusation to make on that head), I never perceived them to be unpleasant to you. I am half inclined to think, [MASK], that you do not quite know your own feelings.
MansfieldPark	53	125149	125148	125201	Edmund	"[MASK], I consider, from his dispositions and habits, as much more likely to marry early than his brother. _He_, indeed, I have lately thought, has seen the woman he could love, which, I am convinced, my eldest son has not.
MansfieldPark	54	126141	126102	126156	Fanny	I should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect. _You_ are not to be judged by the same rule. You do not owe me the duty of a child. But, [MASK], if your heart can acquit you of _ingratitude_ " He ceased.
MansfieldPark	54	126157	126157	126211	Fanny	[MASK] was by this time crying so bitterly that, angry as he was, he would not press that article farther. Her heart was almost broke by such a picture of what she appeared to him; by such accusations, so heavy, so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation!
MansfieldPark	58	127066	127064	127122	Fanny	" Here [MASK], who had looked up, looked down again. "Of course," continued her uncle, "it cannot be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone, be it only for five minutes; a request too natural, a claim too just to be denied.
MansfieldPark	51	127626	127582	127633	Norris	"I must be a brute, indeed, if I can be really ungrateful!" said she, in soliloquy. "Heaven defend me from being ungrateful!" She saw nothing more of her uncle, nor of her aunt [MASK], till they met at dinner.
MansfieldPark	59	128160	128142	128201	Fanny	It was over, however, at last; and the evening set in with more composure to [MASK], and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could have hoped for after so stormy a morning; but she trusted, in the first place, that she had done right: that her judgment had not misled her.
MansfieldPark	49	129163	129138	129187	Fanny	He rather derived spirits from it. He had been apt to gain hearts too easily. His situation was new and animating. To [MASK], however, who had known too much opposition all her life to find any charm in it, all this was unintelligible.
MansfieldPark	55	131300	131256	131311	Fanny	He pressed for the strictest forbearance and silence towards their niece; she not only promised, but did observe it. She only looked her increased ill-will. Angry she was: bitterly angry; but she was more angry with [MASK] for having received such an offer than for refusing it.
MansfieldPark	50	131436	131408	131458	Fanny	She had been a beauty, and a prosperous beauty, all her life; and beauty and wealth were all that excited her respect. To know [MASK] to be sought in marriage by a man of fortune, raised her, therefore, very much in her opinion.
MansfieldPark	45	131791	131774	131819	Fanny	" This was almost the only rule of conduct, the only piece of advice, which [MASK] had ever received from her aunt in the course of eight years and a half. It silenced her. She felt how unprofitable contention would be.
MansfieldPark	46	131851	131844	131890	Fanny	"I will tell you what, [MASK]," said she, "I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball; I am sure the mischief was done that evening. You did look remarkably well. Everybody said so.
MansfieldPark	49	132225	132225	132274	William	[MASK]'s promotion, with all its particulars, he was soon master of; and with such a secret provision of comfort within his own breast to help the joy, he found in it a source of most gratifying sensation and unvarying cheerfulness all dinner-time.
MansfieldPark	47	132363	132323	132370	Edmund	They sat so much longer than usual in the dining-parlour, that she was sure they must be talking of her; and when tea at last brought them away, and she was to be seen by [MASK] again, she felt dreadfully guilty.
MansfieldPark	43	132697	132664	132707	Edmund	He had not given her time to attach herself. He had begun at the wrong end. With such powers as his, however, and such a disposition as hers, [MASK] trusted that everything would work out a happy conclusion.
MansfieldPark	52	132862	132862	132914	Fanny	[MASK] was worth it all; he held her to be worth every effort of patience, every exertion of mind, but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any woman breathing, without something more to warm his courage than his eyes could discern in hers.
MansfieldPark	54	132922	132915	132969	Crawford	He was very willing to hope that [MASK] saw clearer, and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his friend that he could come to from all that he observed to pass before, and at, and after dinner. In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought more promising.
MansfieldPark	44	133030	133029	133073	Fanny	"[MASK] has been reading to me, and only put the book down upon hearing you coming." And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the air of being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare.
MansfieldPark	57	133105	133049	133106	Fanny	And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the air of being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare. "She often reads to me out of those books; and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man's what's his name, [MASK]?
MansfieldPark	44	133209	133200	133244	Fanny	Not a look or an offer of help had [MASK] given; not a syllable for or against. All her attention was for her work. She seemed determined to be interested by nothing else. But taste was too strong in her.
MansfieldPark	41	133706	133705	133746	Shakespeare	But [MASK] one gets acquainted with without knowing how. It is a part of an Englishman's constitution. His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere; one is intimate with him by instinct.
MansfieldPark	46	133818	133797	133843	Shakespeare	His celebrated passages are quoted by everybody; they are in half the books we open, and we all talk [MASK], use his similes, and describe with his descriptions; but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it.
MansfieldPark	55	133889	133844	133899	Crawford	To know him in bits and scraps is common enough; to know him pretty thoroughly is, perhaps, not uncommon; but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent." "Sir, you do me honour," was [MASK]'s answer, with a bow of mock gravity.
MansfieldPark	46	133906	133900	133946	Fanny	Both gentlemen had a glance at [MASK], to see if a word of accordant praise could be extorted from her; yet both feeling that it could not be. Her praise had been given in her attention; _that_ must content them.
MansfieldPark	52	134381	134373	134425	Edmund	"Even in my profession," said [MASK], with a smile, "how little the art of reading has been studied! how little a clear manner, and good delivery, have been attended to! I speak rather of the past, however, than the present.
MansfieldPark	59	134682	134676	134735	Fanny	This would be the way to [MASK]'s heart. She was not to be won by all that gallantry and wit and good-nature together could do; or, at least, she would not be won by them nearly so soon, without the assistance of sentiment and feeling, and seriousness on serious subjects.
MansfieldPark	56	134803	134777	134833	Fanny	For myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be" (here was a glance at [MASK]); "that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to have it to read myself.
MansfieldPark	43	134842	134834	134877	Fanny	Did you speak?" stepping eagerly to [MASK], and addressing her in a softened voice; and upon her saying "No," he added, "Are you sure you did not speak? I saw your lips move.
MansfieldPark	48	135874	135860	135908	Fanny	Did you think I ought?" "Perhaps, sir," said [MASK], wearied at last into speaking "perhaps, sir, I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment.
MansfieldPark	56	136055	136050	136106	Crawford	"Well," said [MASK], after a course of rapid questions and reluctant answers; "I am happier than I was, because I now understand more clearly your opinion of me. You think me unsteady: easily swayed by the whim of the moment, easily tempted, easily put aside.
MansfieldPark	52	136355	136350	136402	Fanny	Yes, dearest, sweetest [MASK]. Nay" (seeing her draw back displeased), "forgive me. Perhaps I have as yet no right; but by what other name can I call you? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other?
MansfieldPark	50	136407	136371	136421	Fanny	Perhaps I have as yet no right; but by what other name can I call you? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other? No, it is [MASK]' that I think of all day, and dream of all night.
MansfieldPark	46	136595	136579	136625	Fanny	But though the conference had seemed full long to him, and though on looking at [MASK] he saw rather a flush of vexation, he inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened to without some profit to the speaker.
MansfieldPark	54	136902	136887	136941	Fanny	If she did not need counsel, she must need the comfort of communication. [MASK] estranged from him, silent and reserved, was an unnatural state of things; a state which he must break through, and which he could easily learn to think she was wanting him to break through.
MansfieldPark	52	137006	136997	137049	Fanny	"I am come to walk with you, [MASK]," said he. "Shall I?" Drawing her arm within his. "It is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together." She assented to it all rather by look than word.
MansfieldPark	49	137058	137050	137099	Fanny	Her spirits were low. "But, [MASK]," he presently added, "in order to have a comfortable walk, something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together. You must talk to me. I know you have something on your mind.
MansfieldPark	54	137170	137158	137212	Fanny	" "Not of facts, perhaps; but of feelings, [MASK]. No one but you can tell me them. I do not mean to press you, however. If it is not what you wish yourself, I have done. I had thought it might be a relief.
MansfieldPark	47	137284	137252	137299	Crawford	I dare say that, on a comparison of our opinions, they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be: to the point I consider [MASK]'s proposals as most advantageous and desirable, if you could return his affection.
MansfieldPark	50	137380	137336	137386	Fanny	Can there be any disagreement between us here?" "Oh no! But I thought you blamed me. I thought you were against me. This is such a comfort!" "This comfort you might have had sooner, [MASK], had you sought it.
MansfieldPark	47	137459	137450	137497	Fanny	" "As far as you have gone, [MASK], I think you perfectly right. I may be sorry, I may be surprised though hardly _that_, for you had not had time to attach yourself but I think you perfectly right.
MansfieldPark	48	137529	137491	137539	Fanny	but I think you perfectly right. Can it admit of a question? It is disgraceful to us if it does. You did not love him; nothing could have justified your accepting him." [MASK] had not felt so comfortable for days and days.
MansfieldPark	52	137569	137540	137592	Crawford	"So far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise. But the matter does not end here. [MASK]'s is no common attachment; he perseveres, with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before.
MansfieldPark	58	137620	137605	137663	Fanny	But" (with an affectionate smile) "let him succeed at last, [MASK], let him succeed at last. You have proved yourself upright and disinterested, prove yourself grateful and tender-hearted; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born for.
MansfieldPark	52	137933	137905	137957	Fanny	I wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for. I wish he had known you as well as I do, [MASK]. Between us, I think we should have won you. My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed.
MansfieldPark	55	138048	138038	138093	Fanny	" "We are so totally unlike," said [MASK], avoiding a direct answer, "we are so very, very different in all our inclinations and ways, that I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together, even if I _could_ like him.
MansfieldPark	50	138121	138102	138152	Fanny	We have not one taste in common. We should be miserable." "You are mistaken, [MASK]. The dissimilarity is not so strong. You are quite enough alike. You _have_ tastes in common. You have moral and literary tastes in common.
MansfieldPark	51	138272	138242	138293	Fanny	His cheerfulness will counteract this. He sees difficulties nowhere: and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you. Your being so far unlike, [MASK], does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together: do not imagine it.
MansfieldPark	49	138811	138786	138835	Maria	" "Very possibly. No wonder. Nothing could be more improper than the whole business. I am shocked whenever I think that [MASK] could be capable of it; but, if she could undertake the part, we must not be surprised at the rest.
MansfieldPark	51	139157	139134	139185	Crawford	Under the disadvantages, indeed, which both have had, is it not wonderful that they should be what they are? [MASK]'s _feelings_, I am ready to acknowledge, have hitherto been too much his guides. Happily, those feelings have generally been good.
MansfieldPark	46	139280	139267	139313	Fanny	" "I would not engage in such a charge," cried [MASK], in a shrinking accent; "in such an office of high responsibility!" "As usual, believing yourself unequal to anything! fancying everything too much for you!
MansfieldPark	52	139354	139307	139359	Crawford	fancying everything too much for you! Well, though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings, you will be persuaded into them, I trust. I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may. I have no common interest in [MASK]'s well-doing.
MansfieldPark	50	139530	139498	139548	Fanny	I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims, which she has been too much used to hear. But it was very different. She spoke of you, [MASK], just as she ought. She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself.
MansfieldPark	55	139723	139689	139744	Fanny	" "Yes, she laments it; yet owns it may have been best. You will see her, however, before she goes. She is very angry with you, [MASK]; you must be prepared for that. She calls herself very angry, but you can imagine her anger.
MansfieldPark	50	139783	139745	139795	William	It is the regret and disappointment of a sister, who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for, at the first moment. She is hurt, as you would be for [MASK]; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart.
MansfieldPark	45	139890	139848	139893	Henry	Her heart is made for love and kindness, not for resentment. I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise; I wish you could have seen her countenance, when she said that you _should_ be [MASK]'s wife.
MansfieldPark	57	140059	140048	140105	Fanny	" "I _should_ have thought," said [MASK], after a pause of recollection and exertion, "that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man's not being approved, not being loved by some one of her sex at least, let him be ever so generally agreeable.
MansfieldPark	46	140382	140343	140389	Fanny	And, and we think very differently of the nature of women, if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply." "My dear, dear [MASK], now I have the truth.
MansfieldPark	48	140604	140568	140616	Fanny	She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time, and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years' happy marriage." [MASK] could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for.
MansfieldPark	47	140843	140837	140884	Mansfield	Had I received any letter from [MASK], to tell me how you were all going on, I believe I should certainly have staid; but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight, and felt that I had been away long enough.
MansfieldPark	48	140982	140968	141016	Fanny	Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected girls. But I am spoilt, [MASK], for common female society. Good-humoured, unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. They are two distinct orders of being.
MansfieldPark	48	141032	141027	141075	Fanny	" Still, however, [MASK] was oppressed and wearied; he saw it in her looks, it could not be talked away; and attempting it no more, he led her directly, with the kind authority of a privileged guardian, into the house.
MansfieldPark	51	141208	141169	141220	Crawford	He gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to his father; and recommended there being nothing more said to her: no farther attempts to influence or persuade; but that everything should be left to [MASK]'s assiduities, and the natural workings of her own mind.
MansfieldPark	51	141749	141749	141800	Fanny	[MASK] naturally turned upstairs, and took her guest to the apartment which was now always fit for comfortable use; opening the door, however, with a most aching heart, and feeling that she had a more distressing scene before her than ever that spot had yet witnessed.
MansfieldPark	53	142049	142023	142076	Anhalt	He was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me. I think I see him now, trying to be as demure and composed as [MASK] ought, through the two long speeches. When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimony may be called a happy life.'
MansfieldPark	51	142145	142140	142191	Fanny	Say what you would, [MASK], it should be _that_; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other. His sturdy spirit to bend as it did! Oh! it was sweet beyond expression. But alas, that very evening destroyed it all.
MansfieldPark	52	142288	142260	142312	Fanny	Nay, in sober sadness, I believe I now love you all." And having said so, with a degree of tenderness and consciousness which [MASK] had never seen in her before, and now thought only too becoming, she turned away for a moment to recover herself.
MansfieldPark	42	142558	142557	142599	Fanny	" [MASK] roused herself, and replying only in part, said, "But you are only going from one set of friends to another. You are going to a very particular friend." "Yes, very true.
MansfieldPark	51	142934	142891	142942	Fanny	To be sure, your uncle's returning that very evening! There never was anything quite like it." Another short fit of abstraction followed, when, shaking it off, she thus attacked her companion. "Why, [MASK], you are absolutely in a reverie.
MansfieldPark	46	142982	142943	142989	Henry	Thinking, I hope, of one who is always thinking of you. Oh! that I could transport you for a short time into our circle in town, that you might understand how your power over [MASK] is thought of there! Oh!
MansfieldPark	47	143020	142988	143035	Henry	Oh! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done! For as to secrecy, [MASK] is quite the hero of an old romance, and glories in his chains.
MansfieldPark	48	143724	143687	143735	Fanny	But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him, I should never have done. It is you, only you, insensible [MASK], who can think of him with anything like indifference.
MansfieldPark	50	143767	143736	143786	Fanny	But are you so insensible as you profess yourself? No, no, I see you are not." There was, indeed, so deep a blush over [MASK]'s face at that moment as might warrant strong suspicion in a predisposed mind. "Excellent creature!
MansfieldPark	55	143992	143983	144038	Fanny	" "I will not say," replied [MASK], "that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so, for there was something in your look that frightened me, but not at first; I was as unsuspicious of it at first indeed, indeed I was.
MansfieldPark	53	144267	144264	144317	Fanny	And then, [MASK], the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many; of having it in one's power to pay off the debts of one's sex! Oh! I am sure it is not in woman's nature to refuse such a triumph.
MansfieldPark	49	144319	144318	144367	Fanny	" [MASK] shook her head. "I cannot think well of a man who sports with any woman's feelings; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander-by can judge of." "I do not defend him.
MansfieldPark	47	144562	144554	144601	Fanny	" She had made a sure push at [MASK]'s feelings here. "Oh! yes. How very, very kind of him." "I know he must have exerted himself very much, for I know the parties he had to move.
MansfieldPark	47	144958	144948	144995	Fanny	" The first, at least, of these favours [MASK] would rather not have been asked; but it was impossible for her to refuse the correspondence; it was impossible for her even not to accede to it more readily than her own judgment authorised.
MansfieldPark	57	145400	145368	145425	Edmund	She was always so gentle and retiring that her emotions were beyond his discrimination. He did not understand her: he felt that he did not; and therefore applied to [MASK] to tell him how she stood affected on the present occasion, and whether she were more or less happy than she had been.
MansfieldPark	46	146988	146970	147016	Edmund	This was a prospect to be dwelt on with a fondness that could be but half acknowledged. [MASK], too to be two months from _him_ (and perhaps she might be allowed to make her absence three) must do her good.
MansfieldPark	56	147299	147267	147323	Fanny	In the calmness of her own dressing-room, in the impartial flow of her own meditations, unbiassed by his bewildering statements, she could not acknowledge any necessity for [MASK]'s ever going near a father and mother who had done without her so long, while she was so useful to herself.
MansfieldPark	46	147669	147669	147715	William	[MASK] was almost as happy in the plan as his sister. It would be the greatest pleasure to him to have her there to the last moment before he sailed, and perhaps find her there still when he came in from his first cruise.
MansfieldPark	48	148645	148604	148652	Edmund	Had she doubted his meaning while she listened, the glow in his face, when she looked up at him, would have been decisive. For this letter she must try to arm herself. That a letter from [MASK] should be a subject of terror!
MansfieldPark	46	149754	149726	149772	William	She was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven years old, who, rushing out of the house, pushed the maid aside, and while [MASK] was opening the chaise-door himself, called out, "You are just in time.
MansfieldPark	52	150214	150185	150237	Sam	She is gone out of harbour already; three days before we had any thought of it; and I do not know what I am to do about [MASK]'s things, they will never be ready in time; for she may have her orders to-morrow, perhaps.
MansfieldPark	49	150492	150464	150513	Betsey	"Poor dears! how tired you must both be! and now, what will you have? I began to think you would never come. [MASK] and I have been watching for you this half-hour. And when did you get anything to eat?
MansfieldPark	46	150560	150555	150601	Campbell	And now I am afraid [MASK] will be here before there is time to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand. It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street. We were better off in our last house.
MansfieldPark	46	150684	150683	150729	Betsey	" [MASK] went with alacrity, proud to shew her abilities before her fine new sister. "Dear me!" continued the anxious mother, "what a sad fire we have got, and I dare say you are both starved with cold.
MansfieldPark	47	150743	150700	150747	Rebecca	"Dear me!" continued the anxious mother, "what a sad fire we have got, and I dare say you are both starved with cold. Draw your chair nearer, my dear. I cannot think what [MASK] has been about.
MansfieldPark	52	150942	150942	150994	Fanny	[MASK] with doubting feelings had risen to meet him, but sank down again on finding herself undistinguished in the dusk, and unthought of. With a friendly shake of his son's hand, and an eager voice, he instantly began "Ha! welcome back, my boy.
MansfieldPark	50	151694	151694	151744	Tom	[MASK], however, had no mind for such treatment: he came home not to stand and be talked to, but to run about and make a noise; and both boys had soon burst from her, and slammed the parlour-door till her temples ached.
MansfieldPark	58	151871	151848	151906	Betsey	He was in distress for something that he had left there, and did not find again. A key was mislaid, [MASK] accused of having got at his new hat, and some slight, but essential alteration of his uniform waistcoat, which he had been promised to have done for him, entirely neglected.
MansfieldPark	46	152019	152019	152065	Fanny	[MASK] was almost stunned. The smallness of the house and thinness of the walls brought everything so close to her, that, added to the fatigue of her journey, and all her recent agitation, she hardly knew how to bear it. _
MansfieldPark	54	152076	152066	152120	Susan	Within_ the room all was tranquil enough, for [MASK] having disappeared with the others, there were soon only her father and herself remaining; and he, taking out a newspaper, the accustomary loan of a neighbour, applied himself to studying it, without seeming to recollect her existence.
MansfieldPark	49	152270	152264	152313	Mansfield	It did pain her to have [MASK] forgotten; the friends who had done so much the dear, dear friends! But here, one subject swallowed up all the rest. Perhaps it must be so. The destination of the Thrush must be now preeminently interesting.
MansfieldPark	54	152428	152379	152433	Devil	The only interruption which thoughts like these received for nearly half an hour was from a sudden burst of her father's, not at all calculated to compose them. At a more than ordinary pitch of thumping and hallooing in the passage, he exclaimed, "[MASK] take those young dogs!
MansfieldPark	53	152685	152670	152723	Sally	"She had been into the kitchen," she said, "to hurry [MASK] and help make the toast, and spread the bread and butter, or she did not know when they should have got tea, and she was sure her sister must want something after her journey.
MansfieldPark	47	153819	153794	153841	Mary	"It was very hard that she was not to have her _own_ knife; it was her own knife; little sister [MASK] had left it to her upon her deathbed, and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago.
MansfieldPark	47	154428	154408	154455	Susan	There was nothing to raise her spirits in the confined and scantily furnished chamber that she was to share with [MASK]. The smallness of the rooms above and below, indeed, and the narrowness of the passage and staircase, struck her beyond her imagination.
MansfieldPark	43	154769	154745	154788	Fanny	His last thought on leaving home was for her. He stepped back again to the door to say, "Take care of [MASK], mother. She is tender, and not used to rough it like the rest of us.
MansfieldPark	55	156035	156004	156059	Mansfield	Everything where she now was in full contrast to it. The elegance, propriety, regularity, harmony, and perhaps, above all, the peace and tranquillity of [MASK], were brought to her remembrance every hour of the day, by the prevalence of everything opposite to them _here_.
MansfieldPark	46	156759	156730	156776	Julia	I did not use to think her wanting in self-possession, but she had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday. Upon the whole, [MASK] was in the best looks of the two, at least after you were spoken of.
MansfieldPark	42	157424	157424	157466	Susan	[MASK] had always behaved pleasantly to herself, but the determined character of her general manners had astonished and alarmed her, and it was at least a fortnight before she began to understand a disposition so totally different from her own.
MansfieldPark	59	157510	157483	157542	Fanny	That a girl of fourteen, acting only on her own unassisted reason, should err in the method of reform, was not wonderful; and [MASK] soon became more disposed to admire the natural light of the mind which could so early distinguish justly, than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led.
MansfieldPark	43	157648	157641	157684	Susan	In every argument with her mother, [MASK] had in point of reason the advantage, and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her off. The blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around her she had never known.
MansfieldPark	58	157715	157669	157727	Susan	The blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around her she had never known. There was no gratitude for affection past or present to make her better bear with its excesses to the others. All this became gradually evident, and gradually placed [MASK] before her sister as an object of mingled compassion and respect.
MansfieldPark	49	157761	157728	157777	Fanny	That her manner was wrong, however, at times very wrong, her measures often ill-chosen and ill-timed, and her looks and language very often indefensible, [MASK] could not cease to feel; but she began to hope they might be rectified.
MansfieldPark	50	158646	158606	158656	Fanny	By degrees the girls came to spend the chief of the morning upstairs, at first only in working and talking, but after a few days, the remembrance of the said books grew so potent and stimulative that [MASK] found it impossible not to try for books again.
MansfieldPark	51	159162	159153	159204	William	The consciousness of his being known there only as [MASK]'s friend was some support. Having introduced him, however, and being all reseated, the terrors that occurred of what this visit might lead to were overpowering, and she fancied herself on the point of fainting away.
MansfieldPark	55	159350	159350	159405	Fanny	[MASK] was just recovered enough to feel that _she_ could not regret it; for to her many other sources of uneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he found her. She might scold herself for the weakness, but there was no scolding it away.
MansfieldPark	55	159770	159770	159825	Fanny	[MASK] listened collectedly, even to the last-mentioned circumstance; nay, it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any certainty; and the words, "then by this time it is all settled," passed internally, without more evidence of emotion than a faint blush.
MansfieldPark	48	161307	161260	161308	Fanny	He had introduced himself to some tenants whom he had never seen before; he had begun making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence, though on his own estate, had been hitherto unknown to him. This was aimed, and well aimed, at [MASK].
MansfieldPark	45	162109	162069	162114	Mansfield	He was decidedly improved. She wished the next day over, she wished he had come only for one day; but it was not so very bad as she would have expected: the pleasure of talking of [MASK] was so very great!
MansfieldPark	56	162152	162115	162171	Fanny	Before they parted, she had to thank him for another pleasure, and one of no trivial kind. Her father asked him to do them the honour of taking his mutton with them, and [MASK] had time for only one thrill of horror, before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement.
MansfieldPark	52	163698	163672	163724	Fanny	You know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done. You know all that would be felt on the occasion." [MASK] thanked him, but tried to laugh it off. "I am perfectly serious," he replied, "as you perfectly know.
MansfieldPark	57	163768	163739	163796	Mary	Indeed, you shall _not_; it shall not be in your power; for so long only as you positively say, in every letter to [MASK], I am well,' and I know you cannot speak or write a falsehood, so long only shall you be considered as well.
MansfieldPark	44	163798	163797	163841	Fanny	" [MASK] thanked him again, but was affected and distressed to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much, or even to be certain of what she ought to say. This was towards the close of their walk.
MansfieldPark	44	163895	163880	163924	Fanny	"I wish you were not so tired," said he, still detaining [MASK] after all the others were in the house "I wish I left you in stronger health. Is there anything I can do for you in town?
MansfieldPark	47	163942	163937	163984	Maddison	I am not satisfied about [MASK]. I am sure he still means to impose on me if possible, and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill, which I design for somebody else. I must come to an understanding with him.
MansfieldPark	51	164326	164296	164347	Edmund	" "Have you no message for anybody?" "My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, my cousin [MASK], I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him.
MansfieldPark	47	164375	164348	164395	Fanny	" "Certainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write his excuses myself." He could say no more, for [MASK] would be no longer detained. He pressed her hand, looked at her, and was gone. _
MansfieldPark	56	165729	165681	165737	Henry	Those vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty and health. My poor aunt always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea, which the Admiral of course never believed, but I know it was so. I am at your service and [MASK]'s, at an hour's notice.
MansfieldPark	56	165988	165937	165993	Edmund	" This was a letter to be run through eagerly, to be read deliberately, to supply matter for much reflection, and to leave everything in greater suspense than ever. The only certainty to be drawn from it was, that nothing decisive had yet taken place. [MASK] had not yet spoken.
MansfieldPark	45	166154	166114	166159	Fanny	She would try to be more ambitious than her heart would allow. She would hesitate, she would tease, she would condition, she would require a great deal, but she would finally accept. This was [MASK]'s most frequent expectation.
MansfieldPark	52	166417	166369	166421	Susan	She was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving this than she had been before; and for a few days was so unsettled by it altogether, by what had come, and what might come, that her usual readings and conversation with [MASK] were much suspended.
MansfieldPark	54	167091	167047	167101	Fanny	As she opened, and saw its length, she prepared herself for a minute detail of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towards the fortunate creature who was now mistress of his fate. These were the contents "My Dear [MASK], Excuse me that I have not written before.
MansfieldPark	53	167720	167713	167766	Fanny	I cannot give her up, [MASK]. She is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife. If I did not believe that she had some regard for me, of course I should not say this, but I do believe it.
MansfieldPark	48	167928	167917	167965	Fanny	You have my thoughts exactly as they arise, my dear [MASK]; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory, but it will not be a less faithful picture of my mind. Having once begun, it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel.
MansfieldPark	48	168921	168894	168942	Edmund	As for the main subject of the letter, there was nothing in that to soothe irritation. She was almost vexed into displeasure and anger against [MASK]. "There is no good in this delay," said she. "Why is not it settled?
MansfieldPark	47	169147	169147	169194	Edmund	[MASK], you do not know me. The families would never be connected if you did not connect them! Oh! write, write. Finish it at once. Let there be an end of this suspense. Fix, commit, condemn yourself.
MansfieldPark	50	169211	169188	169238	Fanny	Fix, commit, condemn yourself." Such sensations, however, were too near akin to resentment to be long guiding [MASK]'s soliloquies. She was soon more softened and sorrowful. His warm regard, his kind expressions, his confidential treatment, touched her strongly.
MansfieldPark	41	170266	170258	170299	Fanny	"He is just come, my dear [MASK], and is taken upstairs; and I am so shocked to see him, that I do not know what to do. I am sure he has been very ill.
MansfieldPark	51	171927	171923	171974	Fanny	It was sad to [MASK] to lose all the pleasures of spring. She had not known before what pleasures she _had_ to lose in passing March and April in a town. She had not known before how much the beginnings and progress of vegetation had delighted her.
MansfieldPark	53	173033	173009	173062	Fanny	Varnish and gilding hide many stains. It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name. With real affection, [MASK], like mine, more might be overlooked. Write to me by return of post, judge of my anxiety, and do not trifle with it.
MansfieldPark	51	174044	174044	174095	Edmund	[MASK] would be forgiven for being a clergyman, it seemed, under certain conditions of wealth; and this, she suspected, was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon. She had only learnt to think nothing of consequence but money.
MansfieldPark	45	174353	174328	174373	Henry	Depend upon it, there is some mistake, and that a day or two will clear it up; at any rate, that [MASK] is blameless, and in spite of a moment's _etourderie_, thinks of nobody but you.
MansfieldPark	52	174459	174435	174487	Fanny	But why would not you let us come for you? I wish you may not repent it. Yours, etc." [MASK] stood aghast. As no scandalous, ill-natured rumour had reached her, it was impossible for her to understand much of this strange letter.
MansfieldPark	55	174820	174820	174875	Fanny	[MASK] was disappointed. She could still think of little else all the morning; but, when her father came back in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual, she was so far from expecting any elucidation through such a channel that the subject was for a moment out of her head.
MansfieldPark	47	175662	175645	175692	Fanny	And it would not be ten minutes' work." The horror of a mind like [MASK]'s, as it received the conviction of such guilt, and began to take in some part of the misery that must ensue, can hardly be described.
MansfieldPark	53	175880	175880	175933	Fanny	[MASK] seemed to herself never to have been shocked before. There was no possibility of rest. The evening passed without a pause of misery, the night was totally sleepless. She passed only from feelings of sickness to shudderings of horror; and from hot fits of fever to cold.
MansfieldPark	55	176608	176602	176657	Susan	My father wishes you to invite [MASK] to go with you for a few months. Settle it as you like; say what is proper; I am sure you will feel such an instance of his kindness at such a moment! Do justice to his meaning, however I may confuse it.
MansfieldPark	49	176695	176667	176716	Fanny	There is no end of the evil let loose upon us. You will see me early by the mail. Yours, etc." Never had [MASK] more wanted a cordial. Never had she felt such a one as this letter contained. To-morrow!
MansfieldPark	46	177002	176973	177019	Susan	She had not time to be miserable. Within twenty-four hours she was hoping to be gone; her father and mother must be spoken to, [MASK] prepared, everything got ready. Business followed business; the day was hardly long enough.
MansfieldPark	52	177274	177227	177279	Edmund	The advantage of much sleep to prepare them for their journey was impossible. The cousin who was travelling towards them could hardly have less than visited their agitated spirits one all happiness, the other all varying and indescribable perturbation. By eight in the morning [MASK] was in the house.
MansfieldPark	46	177289	177280	177326	Fanny	The girls heard his entrance from above, and [MASK] went down. The idea of immediately seeing him, with the knowledge of what he must be suffering, brought back all her own first feelings. He so near her, and in misery.
MansfieldPark	49	177365	177327	177376	Fanny	She was ready to sink as she entered the parlour. He was alone, and met her instantly; and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these words, just articulate, "My [MASK], my only sister; my only comfort now!"
MansfieldPark	52	177465	177452	177504	Mansfield	His great object was to be off as soon as possible. When [MASK] was considered, time was precious; and the state of his own mind made him find relief only in motion. It was settled that he should order the carriage to the door in half an hour.
MansfieldPark	43	177505	177488	177531	Fanny	It was settled that he should order the carriage to the door in half an hour. [MASK] answered for their having breakfasted and being quite ready in half an hour. He had already ate, and declined staying for their meal.
MansfieldPark	56	177557	177520	177576	Fanny	He had already ate, and declined staying for their meal. He would walk round the ramparts, and join them with the carriage. He was gone again; glad to get away even from [MASK]. He looked very ill; evidently suffering under violent emotions, which he was determined to suppress.
MansfieldPark	41	177789	177770	177811	Susan	Had he been alone with her, his heart must have opened in spite of every resolution; but [MASK]'s presence drove him quite into himself, and his attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never be long supported.
MansfieldPark	46	177812	177812	177858	Fanny	[MASK] watched him with never-failing solicitude, and sometimes catching his eye, revived an affectionate smile, which comforted her; but the first day's journey passed without her hearing a word from him on the subjects that were weighing him down.
MansfieldPark	53	178159	178159	178212	Fanny	[MASK] had been everywhere awake to the difference of the country since February; but when they entered the Park her perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest sort. It was three months, full three months, since her quitting it, and the change was from winter to summer.
MansfieldPark	49	178279	178279	178328	Edmund	[MASK] could not share it. She looked at him, but he was leaning back, sunk in a deeper gloom than ever, and with eyes closed, as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him, and the lovely scenes of home must be shut out.
MansfieldPark	43	178469	178469	178512	Maria	[MASK] was her first favourite, the dearest of all; the match had been her own contriving, as she had been wont with such pride of heart to feel and say, and this conclusion of it almost overpowered her.
MansfieldPark	42	178724	178724	178766	Susan	[MASK] too was a grievance. She had not spirits to notice her in more than a few repulsive looks, but she felt her as a spy, and an intruder, and an indigent niece, and everything most odious.
MansfieldPark	48	178772	178730	178778	Susan	She had not spirits to notice her in more than a few repulsive looks, but she felt her as a spy, and an intruder, and an indigent niece, and everything most odious. By her other aunt, [MASK] was received with quiet kindness.
MansfieldPark	46	180096	180067	180113	Julia	Under any circumstances it would have been an unwelcome alliance; but to have it so clandestinely formed, and such a period chosen for its completion, placed [MASK]'s feelings in a most unfavourable light, and severely aggravated the folly of her choice.
MansfieldPark	47	180938	180937	180984	Fanny	How [MASK] listened, with what curiosity and concern, what pain and what delight, how the agitation of his voice was watched, and how carefully her own eyes were fixed on any object but himself, may be imagined. The opening was alarming.
MansfieldPark	45	181221	181183	181228	Henry	I could not answer, but I believe my looks spoke. She felt reproved. Sometimes how quick to feel! With a graver look and voice she then added, I do not mean to defend [MASK] at your sister's expense.'
MansfieldPark	55	181239	181229	181284	Fanny	So she began, but how she went on, [MASK], is not fit, is hardly fit to be repeated to you. I cannot recall all her words. I would not dwell upon them if I could. Their substance was great anger at the _folly_ of each.
MansfieldPark	50	181413	181410	181460	Fanny	For where, [MASK], shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed? Spoilt, spoilt!" After a little reflection, he went on with a sort of desperate calmness. "I will tell you everything, and then have done for ever.
MansfieldPark	46	181688	181670	181716	Fanny	She would have fixed him; she would have made him happy for ever.' My dearest [MASK], I am giving you, I hope, more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been but what never can be now.
MansfieldPark	49	181867	181832	181881	Henry	It is all her fault. Simple girl! I shall never forgive her. Had she accepted him as she ought, they might now have been on the point of marriage, and [MASK] would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object.
MansfieldPark	51	181941	181917	181968	Fanny	Could you have believed it possible? But the charm is broken. My eyes are opened." "Cruel!" said [MASK], "quite cruel. At such a moment to give way to gaiety, to speak with lightness, and to you! Absolute cruelty.
MansfieldPark	51	182109	182069	182120	Fanny	She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot but think that for me, for my feelings, she would . Hers are faults of principle, [MASK]; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted, vitiated mind.
MansfieldPark	51	182234	182206	182257	Fanny	Well, she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them. She spoke of it, [MASK], with a steadier voice than I can." He was obliged to pause more than once as he continued. "
MansfieldPark	52	182472	182450	182502	Henry	Persuade him to let things take their course. If by any officious exertions of his, she is induced to leave [MASK]'s protection, there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him. I know how he is likely to be influenced.
MansfieldPark	44	183396	183368	183412	Fanny	And what an acquaintance has it been! How have I been deceived! Equally in brother and sister deceived! I thank you for your patience, [MASK]. This has been the greatest relief, and now we will have done."
MansfieldPark	47	183512	183512	183559	Fanny	[MASK], now at liberty to speak openly, felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge of her real character, by some hint of what share his brother's state of health might be supposed to have in her wish for a complete reconciliation.
MansfieldPark	45	183567	183560	183605	Nature	This was not an agreeable intimation. [MASK] resisted it for a while. It would have been a vast deal pleasanter to have had her more disinterested in her attachment; but his vanity was not of a strength to fight long against reason.
MansfieldPark	54	183611	183606	183660	Tom	He submitted to believe that [MASK]'s illness had influenced her, only reserving for himself this consoling thought, that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits, she had certainly been _more_ attached to him than could have been expected, and for his sake been more near doing right.
MansfieldPark	57	183745	183745	183802	Fanny	[MASK]'s friendship was all that he had to cling to. CHAPTER XLVIII Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery. I quit such odious subjects as soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody, not greatly in fault themselves, to tolerable comfort, and to have done with all the rest.
MansfieldPark	53	183804	183803	183856	Fanny	My [MASK], indeed, at this very time, I have the satisfaction of knowing, must have been happy in spite of everything. She must have been a happy creature in spite of all that she felt, or thought she felt, for the distress of those around her.
MansfieldPark	49	185065	185049	185098	Fanny	She had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin of all his happiness in [MASK], and carried away no better consolation in leaving him than that she _had_ divided them. What can exceed the misery of such a mind in such a situation?
MansfieldPark	56	185482	185482	185538	Maria	[MASK] had destroyed her own character, and he would not, by a vain attempt to restore what never could be restored, by affording his sanction to vice, or in seeking to lessen its disgrace, be anywise accessory to introducing such misery in another man's family as he had known himself.
MansfieldPark	49	185916	185904	185953	Maria	She had been always used to think herself a little inferior to [MASK]. Her temper was naturally the easiest of the two; her feelings, though quick, were more controllable, and education had not given her so very hurtful a degree of self-consequence.
MansfieldPark	45	187880	187839	187884	Fanny	Her mind, disposition, opinions, and habits wanted no half-concealment, no self-deception on the present, no reliance on future improvement. Even in the midst of his late infatuation, he had acknowledged [MASK]'s mental superiority.
