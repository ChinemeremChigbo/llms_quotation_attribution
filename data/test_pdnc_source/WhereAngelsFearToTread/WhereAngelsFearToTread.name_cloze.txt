WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	138	127	176	Philip	" The good-natured young man hurried away, and [MASK], taking his place, flooded her with a final stream of advice and injunctions--where to stop, how to learn Italian, when to use mosquito-nets, what pictures to look at.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	269	244	296	Philip	Love and understand the Italians, for the people are more marvellous than the land." "How I wish you were coming, [MASK]," she said, flattered at the unwonted notice her brother-in-law was giving her. "I wish I were."
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	747	738	781	Lilia	The guard himself shut the door, and told [MASK] that she would be all right. Then the train moved, and they all moved with it a couple of steps, and waved their handkerchiefs, and uttered cheerful little cries.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	842	841	887	Lilia	" [MASK] smiled and nodded, and then the absurd position of the foot-warmer overcame her, and she began to laugh again. "Oh, I am so sorry," she cried back, "but you do look so funny.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	1355	1345	1388	Lilia	I am certain of it. He wanted to see [MASK] again, and this was the only way." "I hope he is satisfied. I did not think my sister-in-law distinguished herself in her farewells.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	1614	1571	1620	Philip	I came on them in the Park. They were speaking of the Pentateuch." "My dear boy! If possible, she has got worse and worse. It was your idea of Italian travel that saved us!" [MASK] brightened at the little compliment.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	1994	1962	2011	Lilia	For six months she schemed to prevent the match, and when it had taken place she turned to another task--the supervision of her daughter-in-law. [MASK] must be pushed through life without bringing discredit on the family into which she had married.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	2379	2377	2428	Irma	She let [MASK] stop away from school for insufficient reasons, and she allowed her to wear rings. She learnt to bicycle, for the purpose of waking the place up, and coasted down the High Street one Sunday evening, falling off at the turn by the church.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	2445	2429	2472	Philip	If she had not been a relative, it would have been entertaining. But even [MASK], who in theory loved outraging English conventions, rose to the occasion, and gave her a talking which she remembered to her dying day.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	58	2628	2628	2686	Philip	[MASK], however, declared that she was improving. He was particularly gratified when in the early spring she began to visit the smaller towns that he had recommended. "In a place like this," she wrote, "one really does feel in the heart of things, and off the beaten track.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	3007	2958	3008	Harriet	"They ve stopped there over a week!" he cried. "Why! I shouldn t have done as much myself. They must be really keen, for the hotel s none too comfortable." "I cannot understand people," said [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	56	3541	3540	3596	Philip	As [MASK] once said, she had "bolted all the cardinal virtues and couldn t digest them." Though pious and patriotic, and a great moral asset for the house, she lacked that pliancy and tact which her mother so much valued, and had expected her to pick up for herself.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	3662	3657	3701	Philip	she had cried. "[MASK] laughs at everything--the Book Club, the Debating Society, the Progressive Whist, the bazaars. People won t like it. We have our reputation. A house divided against itself cannot stand.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	3813	3792	3842	Harriet	"It s twelve! The second post s in. Run and see if there are any letters." [MASK] did not want to go. "Let s finish the peas. There won t be any letters." "No, dear; please go.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	3975	3939	3983	Harriet	"I don t understand," she said; "it doesn t make sense." "Her letters never did." "But it must be sillier than usual," said [MASK], and her voice began to quaver.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	4040	4009	4052	Harriet	"What is the difficulty?" she said after a long pause. "What is it that puzzles you in this letter?" "The meaning--" faltered [MASK]. The sparrows hopped nearer and began to eye the peas.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	4060	4042	4092	Lilia	The sparrows hopped nearer and began to eye the peas. "The meaning is quite clear--[MASK] is engaged to be married. Don t cry, dear; please me by not crying--don t talk at all. It s more than I could bear.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	4294	4277	4326	Lilia	She was helpless before such effrontery. What awful thing--what awful person had come to [MASK]? "Some one in the hotel." The letter only said that. What kind of person? A gentleman? An Englishman? The letter did not say.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	5273	5230	5285	Lilia	" "But what a place to go to! What nice person, too, do you meet in a hotel?" "Nice or nasty, as I have told you several times before, is not the point. [MASK] has insulted our family, and she shall suffer for it.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	5548	5519	5566	Lilia	Indeed she knew a little now. The man was not an Italian noble, otherwise the telegram would have said so. It must have been written by [MASK]. None but she would have been guilty of the fatuous vulgarity of "Italian nobility."
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	5582	5550	5599	Caroline	None but she would have been guilty of the fatuous vulgarity of "Italian nobility." She recalled phrases of this morning s letter: "We love this place--[MASK] is sweeter than ever, and busy sketching--Italians full of simplicity and charm."
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	5799	5771	5816	Philip	Therefore I forbid her, and if she disobeys we have done with her for ever." "I will do all I can," said [MASK] in a low voice. It was the first time he had had anything to do.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	6097	6055	6098	Baedeker	He must take what is suitably termed a "legno"--a piece of wood--and drive up eight miles of excellent road into the middle ages. For it is impossible, as well as sacrilegious, to be as quick as [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	6142	6113	6156	Monteriano	He was so weary with travelling that he had fallen asleep in the train. His fellow-passengers had the usual Italian gift of divination, and when [MASK] came they knew he wanted to go there, and dropped him out.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	6230	6222	6269	Philip	The man asked six lire; and though [MASK] knew that for eight miles it should scarcely be more than four, yet he was about to give what he was asked, and so make the man discontented and unhappy for the rest of the day.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	6620	6610	6658	Philip	They shook hands without speaking. She made room for [MASK] and his luggage amidst the loud indignation of the unsuccessful driver, whom it required the combined eloquence of the station-master and the station beggar to confute. The silence was prolonged until they started.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	7327	7296	7345	Philip	"Very good-looking. All his features are good, and he is well built--though I dare say English standards would find him too short." [MASK], whose one physical advantage was his height, felt annoyed at her implied indifference to it.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	7486	7450	7501	Philip	The cart-ruts were channels, the hollow lagoons; even the dry white margin of the road was splashed, like a causeway soon to be submerged under the advancing tide of spring. [MASK] paid no attention at the time: he was thinking what to say next.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	7598	7550	7601	Philip	He thought she sounded a little defiant, and crushed her at once. "What is he, please? You haven t told me that. What s his position?" She opened her mouth to speak, and no sound came from it. [MASK] waited patiently.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	7875	7829	7883	Philip	"Well, I don t suppose you ll think it a good match. But that s not the point. I mean the point is not--I mean that social differences--love, after all--not but what--I--" [MASK] ground his teeth together and said nothing.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	8044	8020	8070	Alaric	False teeth and laughing gas and the tilting chair at a place which knew the Etruscan League, and the Pax Romana, and [MASK] himself, and the Countess Matilda, and the Middle Ages, all fighting and holiness, and the Renaissance, all fighting and beauty!
WhereAngelsFearToTread	56	8074	8071	8127	Lilia	He thought of [MASK] no longer. He was anxious for himself: he feared that Romance might die. Romance only dies with life. No pair of pincers will ever pull it out of us. But there is a spurious sentiment which cannot resist the unexpected and the incongruous and the grotesque.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	8148	8109	8159	Philip	But there is a spurious sentiment which cannot resist the unexpected and the incongruous and the grotesque. A touch will loosen it, and the sooner it goes from us the better. It was going from [MASK] now, and therefore he gave the cry of pain.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	56	8376	8354	8410	Monteriano	But as they climbed higher the country opened out, and there appeared, high on a hill to the right, [MASK]. The hazy green of the olives rose up to its walls, and it seemed to float in isolation between trees and sky, like some fantastic ship city of a dream.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	8985	8948	8996	Lilia	The entrance seemed blocked with a crowd. Dogs were barking, bladder whistles being blown, women waving their handkerchiefs, excited children screaming on the stairs, and at the top of the stairs was [MASK] herself, very radiant, with her best blouse on.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	9917	9892	9947	Philip	He suddenly became shy and developed a conceited grin--the grin of the village yokel whose cricket score is mentioned before a stranger. [MASK] himself had loved to watch pallone, that entrancing combination of lawn-tennis and fives. But he did not expect to love it quite so much again.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	9955	9935	9984	Lilia	But he did not expect to love it quite so much again. "Oh, look!" exclaimed [MASK], "the poor wee fish!" A starved cat had been worrying them all for pieces of the purple quivering beef they were trying to swallow.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	10073	10065	10110	Fish	"They have no air." "[MASK] live on water, not on air," he replied in a knowing voice, and sat down. Apparently he was at his ease again, for he took to spitting on the floor.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	10142	10122	10171	Philip	She talked bravely till the end of the disgusting meal, and then got up saying, "Well, [MASK], I am sure you are ready for by-bye. We shall meet at twelve o clock lunch tomorrow, if we don t meet before.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	10189	10172	10217	Philip	They give us caffe later in our rooms." It was a little too impudent. [MASK] replied, "I should like to see you now, please, in my room, as I have come all the way on business."
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	10272	10255	10301	Lilia	The remembrance of his long intellectual supremacy strengthened him, and he began volubly-- "My dear [MASK], don t let s have a scene. Before I arrived I thought I might have to question you. It is unnecessary. I know everything.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	10458	10406	10461	Lilia	I know everything, as I told you before. I am also aware of the social position of an Italian who pulls teeth in a minute provincial town." He was not aware of it, but he ventured to conclude that it was pretty, low. Nor did [MASK] contradict him.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	10628	10595	10642	Gino	And for my own poor part, I think what people are is what matters, but I don t suppose you ll agree. And I should like you to know that [MASK] s uncle is a priest--the same as a clergyman at home.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	42	10783	10756	10798	Lilia	If there was one redeeming feature about the man I might be uneasy. As it is I can trust to time. For the moment, [MASK], he has taken you in, but you will find him out soon.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	10884	10877	10932	Caroline	What s all this to do with [MASK]?" "Because we expected her to--" He saw that the answer would involve him in difficulties, and, waving his hand, continued, "So I am confident, and you in your heart agree, that this engagement will not last.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	10957	10944	10989	Lilia	And I ll also say think of us; for you know, [MASK], that we count you more than a relation. I should feel I was losing my own sister if you did this, and my mother would lose a daughter.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	11125	11098	11143	Philip	" What follows should be prefaced with some simile--the simile of a powder-mine, a thunderbolt, an earthquake--for it blew [MASK] up in the air and flattened him on the ground and swallowed him up in the depths.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	11144	11144	11192	Lilia	[MASK] turned on her gallant defender and said-- "For once in my life I ll thank you to leave me alone. I ll thank your mother too. For twelve years you ve trained me and tortured me, and I ll stand it no more.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	11355	11313	11364	Gino	No, thank you! No, thank you! Bully? Insolent boy? Who s that, pray, but you? But, thank goodness, I can stand up against the world now, for I ve found [MASK], and this time I marry for love!
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	11436	11391	11440	Irma	"Yes! and I forbid you to do it! You despise me, perhaps, and think I m feeble. But you re mistaken. You are ungrateful and impertinent and contemptible, but I will save you in order to save [MASK] and our name.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	11489	11464	11512	Carella	I shall shrink from nothing, for my blood is up. It is unwise of you to laugh. I forbid you to marry [MASK], and I shall tell him so now." "Do," she cried. "Tell him so now.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	11580	11562	11611	Philip	Oh, take care he doesn t hurt you!" She swayed about in vulgar imitation of [MASK] s walk, and then, with a proud glance at the square shoulders of her betrothed, flounced out of the room. Did she intend them to fight?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	11708	11677	11730	Philip	Might I offer you a cigarette? Please sit down." He refused the cigarette and the chair, and remained standing in the full glare of the lamp. [MASK], not averse to such assistance, got his own face into shadow. For a long time he was silent.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	42	11786	11767	11809	Gino	He would make his power felt by restraint. Why, when he looked up to begin, was [MASK] convulsed with silent laughter? It vanished immediately; but he became nervous, and was even more pompous than he intended.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	11906	11860	11908	Philip	And--pardon me if I say it--she is rich and you are poor." "I am not marrying her because she is rich," was the sulky reply. "I never suggested that for a moment," said [MASK] courteously.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	11994	11951	12003	Philip	If you grant my request you will earn our thanks--and you will not be without a reward for your disappointment." "Reward--what reward?" He bent over the back of a chair and looked earnestly at [MASK]. They were coming to terms pretty quickly.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	12037	12018	12069	Philip	" His soul went forth into one exclamation, and then he was silent, with gaping lips. [MASK] would have given double: he had expected a bargain. "You can have them tonight." He found words, and said, "It is too late.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	12083	12056	12108	Philip	" He found words, and said, "It is too late." "But why?" "Because--" His voice broke. [MASK] watched his face,--a face without refinement perhaps, but not without expression,--watched it quiver and re-form and dissolve from emotion into emotion.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	12295	12255	12306	Philip	Oh! And oh, your generosity!" Suddenly he became grave, and said, "Please pardon me; I am rude. I am no better than a peasant, and I--" Here he saw [MASK] s face, and it was too much for him.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	12375	12341	12389	Philip	He uttered a horrified Oh! and then gave up, and bolted away down the passage, shrieking like a child, to tell the joke to his wife. For a time [MASK] lay on the bed, pretending to himself that he was hurt grievously.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	12429	12413	12466	Sawston	"I sleep at the Globo," he told her, "and start for [MASK] tomorrow morning early. He has assaulted me. I could prosecute him. But shall not." "I can t stop here," she sobbed. "I daren t stop here.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	13296	13284	13335	Lilia	He was apologetic, and even cringing, until they turned on [MASK]. Then he turned on them, saying that they could not understand, much less associate with, the English lady who was his wife; that there should be one master in that house--himself.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	57	13336	13298	13355	Lilia	Then he turned on them, saying that they could not understand, much less associate with, the English lady who was his wife; that there should be one master in that house--himself. [MASK] praised and petted him on his return, calling him brave and a hero and other endearing epithets.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	42	13437	13430	13472	Lilia	The cheque was, of course, [MASK] s, who was extremely generous, and was quite willing to know anybody so long as she had not to live with them, relations-in-law being on her nerves.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	13508	13508	13562	Gino	[MASK] wondered how it was that all his people, who had formerly seemed so pleasant, had suddenly become plaintive and disagreeable. He put it down to his lady wife s magnificence, in comparison with which all seemed common. Her money flew apace, in spite of the cheap living.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	13706	13690	13737	Gino	"Look what I am giving up to live with you!" she said to [MASK], never omitting to lay stress on her condescension. He took her to mean the inlaid box, and said that she need not give it up at all.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	13880	13831	13882	Charles	He was poor; therefore he would never dare to criticize his benefactress. He was passionately in love with her; therefore she could do exactly as she liked. "It mayn t be heaven below," she thought, "but it s better than [MASK]."
WhereAngelsFearToTread	42	13969	13965	14007	Irma	He then said that [MASK] had better come out and live with them. "The air is good, so is the food; she will be happy here, and we shall not have to part with the money."
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	14042	14042	14093	Gino	[MASK] became terribly depressed over the solicitors letter, more depressed than she thought necessary. There was no more to do in the house, and he spent whole days in the loggia leaning over the parapet or sitting astride it disconsolately. "Oh, you idle boy!"
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	14190	14166	14216	Gino	" "I want to see no one but you." He spat on to an olive-tree. "Now, [MASK], don t be silly. Go and see your friends, and bring them to see me. We both of us like society.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	14252	14210	14259	Lilia	We both of us like society." He looked puzzled, but allowed himself to be persuaded, went out, found that he was not as friendless as he supposed, and returned after several hours in altered spirits. [MASK] congratulated herself on her good management.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	14289	14260	14314	Sawston	"I m ready, too, for people now," she said. "I mean to wake you all up, just as I woke up [MASK]. Let s have plenty of men--and make them bring their womenkind. I mean to have real English tea-parties.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	14395	14388	14436	Lilia	" "Poor fellow," thought [MASK]. "It is sad for him to discover that his people are vulgar." She began to tell him that she loved him just for his silly self, and he flushed and began tugging at his moustache.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	14807	14772	14822	Gino	"But I must know some one! Who were the men you were talking to this afternoon?" Low-class men. He could scarcely recollect their names. "But, [MASK] dear, if they re low class, why did you talk to them?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	14833	14823	14874	Gino	Don t you care about your position?" All [MASK] cared about at present was idleness and pocket-money, and his way of expressing it was to exclaim, "Ouf-pouf! How hot it is in here. No air; I sweat all over.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	58	14927	14892	14950	Lilia	In his funny abrupt way he ran out on to the loggia, where he lay full length on the parapet, and began to smoke and spit under the silence of the stars. [MASK] gathered somehow from this conversation that Continental society was not the go-as-you-please thing she had expected.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	15587	15581	15633	Lilia	"Very well," smiled [MASK], "very well"--as if she were addressing a solicitous kitten. But for all that she never took a solitary walk again, with one exception, till the day of her death. Days passed, and no one called except poor relatives.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	15705	15666	15716	Gino	She, when she went into the town, was pleasantly received; but people naturally found a difficulty in getting on with a lady who could not learn their language. And the tea-party, under [MASK] s adroit management, receded ever and ever before her.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	16083	16083	16138	Spiridione	[MASK] addressed the other men, none of whom he had ever seen before. "Is it not true? Does not he deserve this wealthy blonde?" "He does deserve her," said all the men. It is a marvellous land, where you love it or hate it.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	16247	16210	16265	Spiridione	They had vermouth and little cakes with sugar on the top, which they chose gravely at the counter, pinching them first to be sure they were fresh. And though vermouth is barely alcoholic, [MASK] drenched his with soda-water to be sure that it should not get into his head.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	16304	16281	16330	Spiridione--"I	But soon they put up their legs on a pair of chairs and began to smoke. "Tell me," said [MASK] forgot to ask--is she young?" "Thirty-three." "Ah, well, we cannot have everything.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	16358	16313	16360	SIMPATICA	" "Thirty-three." "Ah, well, we cannot have everything." "But you would be surprised. Had she told me twenty-eight, I should not have disbelieved her." "Is she [MASK]?"
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	16369	16369	16419	Gino	[MASK] dabbed at the sugar and said after a silence, "Sufficiently so." "It is a most important thing." "She is rich, she is generous, she is affable, she addresses her inferiors without haughtiness." There was another silence.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	16513	16488	16535	Gino	He paid for every one, and the fine for deception besides." "Do you gain much beyond your pay?" asked [MASK], diverted for an instant. "I do not accept small sums now. It is not worth the risk.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	16604	16561	16605	SIMPATICO	The person who understands us at first sight, who never irritates us, who never bores, to whom we can pour forth every thought and wish, not only in speech but in silence--that is what I mean by [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	16832	16805	16854	Spiridione	A great tall man! And when I am really amused I am often impolite." "You will never see him again," said [MASK], who carried plenty of philosophy about him. "And by now the scene will have passed from his mind.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	59	16966	16933	16992	Gino	The shadows of the terra-cotta pillars lengthened, and tourists, flying through the Palazzo Pubblico opposite, could observe how the Italians wasted time. The sight of tourists reminded [MASK] of something he might say. "I want to consult you since you are so kind as to take an interest in my affairs.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	17002	17001	17051	Spiridione	" [MASK] was shocked. "But I have forbidden her." "Naturally." "She does not yet understand. She asked me to accompany her sometimes--to walk without object! You know, she would like me to be with her all day.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	17288	17258	17307	Gino	But it is absurd!" "What am I to do about it?" "Do nothing. Or ask me!" "Come!" cried [MASK], springing up. "She will be quite pleased." The dashing young fellow coloured crimson.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	17391	17361	17413	Gino	" "Certainly not; you are in my country!" A long argument ensued, in which the waiter took part, suggesting various solutions. At last [MASK] triumphed. The bill came to eightpence-halfpenny, and a halfpenny for the waiter brought it up to ninepence.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	17518	17518	17564	Spiridione	[MASK] s manners were very agreeable. He kissed her hand on introduction, and as his profession had taught him a little English, conversation did not flag. "Do you like music?" she asked. "Passionately," he replied.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	17601	17565	17615	Gino	"I have not studied scientific music, but the music of the heart, yes." So she played on the humming piano very badly, and he sang, not so badly. [MASK] got out a guitar and sang too, sitting out on the loggia.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	17623	17623	17672	Gino	[MASK] said he would just walk his friend back to his lodgings. As they went he said, without the least trace of malice or satire in his voice, "I think you are quite right. I shall not bring people to the house any more.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	17780	17775	17823	Lilia	At no one moment did [MASK] realize that her marriage was a failure; yet during the summer and autumn she became as unhappy as it was possible for her nature to be. She had no unkind treatment, and few unkind words, from her husband.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	17977	17952	17996	Philip	She began to see that she must assert herself, but she could not see how. Her self-confidence, which had overthrown [MASK], had gradually oozed away. If she left the strange house there was the strange little town.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	18121	18079	18133	Lilia	And, indeed, there was scarcely a touch of wildness in it--some of those slopes had been under cultivation for two thousand years. But it was terrible and mysterious all the same, and its continued presence made [MASK] so uncomfortable that she forgot her nature and began to reflect.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	18166	18166	18214	Lilia	[MASK] had no religion in her; but for hours at a time she would be seized with a vulgar fear that she was not "married properly," and that her social position in the next world might be as obscure as it was in this.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	42	18252	18252	18294	Gino	[MASK] approved; he, too, thought it safer, and it was fun confessing, though the priest was a stupid old man, and the whole thing was a good slap in the face for the people at home.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	18553	18540	18589	Gino	She was very sprightly, and they thought her quite unconventional, and [MASK] a charming boy, so all that was to the good. But by May the season, such as it was, had finished, and there would be no one till next spring.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	18739	18694	18743	Lilia	He had a good strong will when he chose to use it, and would not have had the least scruple in using bolts and locks to put it into effect. There was plenty of brutality deep down in him, and one day [MASK] nearly touched it.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	18823	18797	18845	Lilia	They had finished their mid-day meal, and he wanted to go and sleep. Nothing would rouse him up, until at last [MASK], getting more and more angry, said, "And I ve got the money." He looked horrified.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	18911	18907	18960	Perfetta	As she said to [MASK] afterwards, "None of his clothes seemed to fit--too big in one place, too small in another." His figure rather than his face altered, the shoulders falling forward till his coat wrinkled across the back and pulled away from his wrists.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	19014	18996	19042	Perfetta	He looked at her with round, expressionless eyes, and slowly stretched out his left hand. [MASK] was heard coming up from the kitchen. It seemed to wake him up, and he turned away and went to his room without a word.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	19754	19728	19772	Lilia	"Perhaps," she thought, "if I have a child he will be different. I know he wants a son." [MASK] had achieved pathos despite herself, for there are some situations in which vulgarity counts no longer.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	19899	19861	19916	Gino	People said she was headstrong, but really her weak brain left her cold. Suffering, however, is more independent of temperament, and the wisest of women could hardly have suffered more. As for [MASK], he was quite as boyish as ever, and carried his iniquities like a feather.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	56	19932	19932	19988	Spiridione	[MASK] is wrong; I must persuade him. Not till marriage does one realize the pleasures and the possibilities of life." So saying, he would take down his felt hat, strike it in the right place as infallibly as a German strikes his in the wrong place, and leave her.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	19999	19956	20005	Lilia	So saying, he would take down his felt hat, strike it in the right place as infallibly as a German strikes his in the wrong place, and leave her. One evening, when he had gone out thus, [MASK] could stand it no longer.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	57	20216	20205	20262	Perfetta	The stairs creaked and the key-hole screamed; but [MASK] was growing deaf. The walls were beautiful, but as they faced west they were in shadow. To see the light upon them she must walk round the town a little, till they were caught by the beams of the rising moon.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	20800	20756	20805	Gino	she moaned. "He will be so angry." And without further effort she slowly climbed back to captivity, shaking her garments as she went. Ill luck pursued her to the end. It was one of the nights when [MASK] happened to come in.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	41	20834	20830	20871	Lilia	At the sight of [MASK] he turned upon her and poured forth a flood of miscellaneous abuse. He was far more angry but much less alarming than he had been that day when he edged after her round the table.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	20873	20872	20923	Lilia	And [MASK] gained more courage from her bad conscience than she ever had from her good one, for as he spoke she was seized with indignation and feared him no longer, and saw him for a cruel, worthless, hypocritical, dissolute upstart, and spoke in return.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	20924	20924	20978	Perfetta	[MASK] screamed for she told him everything--all she knew and all she thought. He stood with open mouth, all the anger gone out of him, feeling ashamed, and an utter fool. He was fairly and rightfully cornered. When had a husband so given himself away before?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	21030	21024	21074	Lilia	"You laugh?" stammered [MASK]. "Ah!" he cried, "who could help it? I, who thought you knew and saw nothing--I am tricked--I am conquered. I give in. Let us talk of it no more.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	21109	21063	21113	Perfetta	I give in. Let us talk of it no more." He touched her on the shoulder like a good comrade, half amused and half penitent, and then, murmuring and smiling to himself, ran quietly out of the room. [MASK] burst into congratulations.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	42	21312	21284	21326	Spiridione	He hated discomfort and yearned for sympathy, but shrank from mentioning his difficulties in the town in case they were put down to his own incompetence. [MASK] was told, and replied in a philosophical but not very helpful letter.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	21988	21976	22021	Lilia	"My love!" he would say, "my dearest [MASK]! Be calm. I have never loved any one but you." She, knowing everything, would only smile gently, too broken by suffering to make sarcastic repartees.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	22066	22046	22094	Gino	" Some strangely tender impulse moved her, and she said faintly, "You are a boy yourself, [MASK]." He answered, "Then we shall be brothers." He lay outside the room with his head against the door like a dog.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	22120	22095	22145	Lilia	When they came to tell him the glad news they found him half unconscious, and his face was wet with tears. As for [MASK], some one said to her, "It is a beautiful boy!" But she had died in giving birth to him.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	22278	22246	22292	Philip	But below the nose and eyes all was confusion, and those people who believe that destiny resides in the mouth and chin shook their heads when they looked at him. [MASK] himself, as a boy, had been keenly conscious of these defects.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	22522	22509	22552	Sawston	He came back with the air of a prophet who would either remodel [MASK] or reject it. All the energies and enthusiasms of a rather friendless life had passed into the championship of beauty. In a short time it was over.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	22558	22553	22607	Sawston	Nothing had happened either in [MASK] or within himself. He had shocked half-a-dozen people, squabbled with his sister, and bickered with his mother. He concluded that nothing could happen, not knowing that human love and love of truth sometimes conquer where love of beauty fails.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	22687	22640	22695	Lilia	If he could not reform the world, he could at all events laugh at it, thus attaining at least an intellectual superiority. Laughter, he read and believed, was a sign of good moral health, and he laughed on contentedly, till [MASK] s marriage toppled contentment down for ever.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	22762	22742	22795	Gino	It was on her soil and through her influence that a silly woman had married a cad. He hated [MASK], the betrayer of his life s ideal, and now that the sordid tragedy had come, it filled him with pangs, not of sympathy, but of final disillusion.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	22857	22852	22907	Lilia	She had been detestable to [MASK] while she lived, but she always felt that the dead deserve attention and sympathy. "After all she has suffered. That letter kept me awake for nights. The whole thing is like one of those horrible modern plays where no one is in the right.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	22953	22933	22981	Lilia	"Of course," said his mother. "But I think we can still not tell her about [MASK] s marriage." "I don t think that. And she must have suspected something by now." "So one would have supposed.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	23076	23040	23088	Lilia	Destroy that and everything goes--morals, behaviour, everything. Absolute trust in some one else is the essence of education. That is why I have been so careful about talking of poor [MASK] before her." "But you forget this wretched baby.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	23157	23129	23178	Philip	He, thank goodness, I hear, has at last consoled himself with someone else." "The child must know some time," persisted [MASK], who felt a little displeased, though he could not tell with what. "The later the better.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	23203	23179	23231	Irma	Every moment she is developing." "I must say it seems rather hard luck, doesn t it?" "On [MASK]? Why?" "On us, perhaps. We have morals and behaviour also, and I don t think this continual secrecy improves them.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	23248	23214	23264	Harriet	We have morals and behaviour also, and I don t think this continual secrecy improves them." "There s no need to twist the thing round to that," said [MASK], rather disturbed. "Of course there isn t," said her mother.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	23470	23462	23510	Caroline	I have come to be very sorry for [MASK]. She, if any one, has suffered and been penitent. She burst into tears when I told her a little, only a little, of that terrible letter. I never saw such genuine remorse.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	23534	23511	23560	Philip	We must forgive her and forget. Let the dead bury their dead. We will not trouble her with them." [MASK] saw that his mother was scarcely logical. But there was no advantage in saying so. "Here beginneth the New Life, then.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	23575	23552	23599	Lilia	"Here beginneth the New Life, then. Do you remember, mother, that was what we said when we saw [MASK] off?" "Yes, dear; but now it is really a New Life, because we are all at accord.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	23756	23726	23771	Lilia	Fortunately the school prize-giving was at hand, and that, together with the prospect of new black clothes, kept her from meditating on the fact that [MASK], who had been absent so long, would now be absent for ever.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	23843	23802	23854	Lilia	I comforted her as best I could, and I kissed her. It is something that the breach between her and ourselves is now entirely healed." "Did she ask no questions--as to the nature of [MASK] s death, I mean?" "She did.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	24087	24073	24122	Lilia	At first she annoyed him. They were talking, of course, about [MASK], when she broke the thread of vague commiseration and said abruptly, "It is all so strange as well as so tragic. And what I did was as strange as anything.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	58	24224	24168	24226	Philip	" "But that s why I can talk about it and tell you everything I have always wanted to. You thought me stupid and sentimental and wicked and mad, but you never really knew how much I was to blame." "Indeed I never think about it now," said [MASK] gently.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	24345	24320	24366	Philip	Once or twice before I had had to send people about their business." "Yes; we counted on you," said [MASK], with sudden sharpness. After all, if she would reveal her thoughts, she must take the consequences.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	24381	24380	24429	Lilia	"[MASK] saw him several times again, and I knew I ought to interfere. I called her to my bedroom one night. She was very frightened, for she knew what it was about and how severe I could be. Do you love this man?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	24467	24430	24478	Philip	I asked. Yes or no? She said Yes. And I said, Why don t you marry him if you think you ll be happy? " "Really--really," exploded [MASK], as exasperated as if the thing had happened yesterday.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	24482	24479	24533	Lilia	"You knew [MASK] all your life. Apart from everything else--as if she could choose what could make her happy!" "Had you ever let her choose?" she flashed out. "I m afraid that s rude," she added, trying to calm herself.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	24544	24513	24563	Philip	she flashed out. "I m afraid that s rude," she added, trying to calm herself. "Let us rather say unhappily expressed," said [MASK], who always adopted a dry satirical manner when he was puzzled. "I want to finish.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	24637	24637	24687	Lilia	[MASK] there was more cowardly than I was. We should have told the truth. It lost me my nerve, at all events. I came to the station meaning to tell you everything then. But we had started with a lie, and I got frightened.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	59	24744	24688	24747	Lilia	And at the end, when you left, I got frightened again and came with you." "Did you really mean to stop?" "For a time, at all events." "Would that have suited a newly married pair?" "It would have suited them. [MASK] needed me.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	24777	24748	24794	Philip	And as for him--I can t help feeling I might have got influence over him." "I am ignorant of these matters," said [MASK]; "but I should have thought that would have increased the difficulty of the situation.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	24901	24890	24940	Sawston	" "Oh, never mind." "I hated [MASK], you see." He was delighted. "So did and do I. That s splendid. Go on." "I hated the idleness, the stupidity, the respectability, the petty unselfishness.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	24950	24906	24957	Sawston	" He was delighted. "So did and do I. That s splendid. Go on." "I hated the idleness, the stupidity, the respectability, the petty unselfishness." "Petty selfishness," he corrected. [MASK] psychology had long been his specialty.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	25069	25053	25098	Lilia	Think it still! I agree with lots of it. Magnificent!" "Now [MASK]," she went on, "though there were things about her I didn t like, had somehow kept the power of enjoying herself with sincerity.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	25100	25083	25136	Gino	I didn t like, had somehow kept the power of enjoying herself with sincerity. And [MASK], I thought, was splendid, and young, and strong not only in body, and sincere as the day. If they wanted to marry, why shouldn t they do so?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	25236	25219	25272	Lilia	But I still feel he cannot have been quite bad when we first met him. [MASK]--that I should dare to say it!--must have been cowardly. He was only a boy--just going to turn into something fine, I thought--and she must have mismanaged him.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	57	25438	25395	25452	Lilia	"I hope you see," she concluded, "why I have troubled you with this long story. Women--I heard you say the other day--are never at ease till they tell their faults out loud. [MASK] is dead and her husband gone to the bad--all through me.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	25594	25580	25631	Philip	" "Oh, I quite sympathize with what you say," said [MASK] encouragingly; "it isn t nonsense, and a year or two ago I should have been saying it too. But I feel differently now, and I hope that you also will change.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	25929	25912	25961	Harriet	On this occasion the subject seemed perfectly inoffensive--a lot of ruined factory chimneys--and [MASK] was about to hand it to her niece when her eye was caught by the words on the margin. She gave a shriek and flung the card into the grate.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	25972	25950	25997	Irma	She gave a shriek and flung the card into the grate. Of course no fire was alight in July, and [MASK] only had to run and pick it out again. "How dare you!" screamed her aunt. "You wicked girl!
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	26138	26128	26177	Irma	Now it is time for you to know." [MASK] returned from the interview sobbing, though, as a matter of fact, she had learnt very little. But that little took hold of her imagination. She had promised secrecy--she knew not why.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	59	26209	26209	26268	Grandmamma	[MASK]! What do you suppose my little brother is doing now? Has he begun to play? Do Italian babies talk sooner than us, or would he be an English baby born abroad? Oh, I do long to see him, and be the first to teach him the Ten Commandments and the Catechism.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	26275	26228	26278	Harriet	Do Italian babies talk sooner than us, or would he be an English baby born abroad? Oh, I do long to see him, and be the first to teach him the Ten Commandments and the Catechism." The last remark always made [MASK] look grave.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	26317	26301	26344	Philip	" "A living brother is more to her than a dead mother," said [MASK] dreamily. "She can knit him socks." "I stopped that. She is bringing him in everywhere. It is most vexatious.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	26519	26512	26555	Irma	"Think of that poor baby. [MASK] is right to pray for him. What an entrance into life for an English child!" "My dear sister, I can reassure you. Firstly, the beastly baby is Italian.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	41	26688	26661	26702	Irma	Just as they had got things a little quiet the beastly baby sent another picture post-card--a comic one, not particularly proper. [MASK] received it while they were out, and all the trouble began again.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	59	26728	26723	26782	Philip	" Two years before, [MASK] would have said that the motive was to give pleasure. Now he, like his mother, tried to think of something sinister and subtle. "Do you suppose that he guesses the situation--how anxious we are to hush the scandal up?" "That is quite possible.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	26786	26756	26805	Irma	"Do you suppose that he guesses the situation--how anxious we are to hush the scandal up?" "That is quite possible. He knows that [MASK] will worry us about the baby. Perhaps he hopes that we shall adopt it to quiet her.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	26895	26869	26917	Philip	" "I told her not to; but we must watch her carefully, without, of course, appearing to be suspicious." [MASK] was getting to enjoy his mother s diplomacy. He did not think of his own morals and behaviour any more.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	26951	26951	27003	Irma	[MASK] did bubble out, that very day. She was proof against a single post-card, not against two. A new little brother is a valuable sentimental asset to a school-girl, and her school was then passing through an acute phase of baby-worship.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	27092	27090	27141	Irma	How could [MASK] keep silent when pretentious girls spoke of baby cousins and baby visitors--she who had a baby brother, who wrote her post-cards through his dear papa? She had promised not to tell about him--she knew not why--and she told.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	27256	27223	27271	Irma	I do not expect that she will have him over. She disapproves of the father. It is altogether a painful business for her." She was careful only to scold [MASK] for disobedience--that eighth deadly sin, so convenient to parents and guardians.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	27272	27272	27322	Harriet	[MASK] would have plunged into needless explanations and abuse. The child was ashamed, and talked about the baby less. The end of the school year was at hand, and she hoped to get another prize. But she also had put her hand to the wheel.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	27566	27542	27585	Philip	" "I was meaning, had you decided on anything?" "The child is no relation of ours," said [MASK]. "It is therefore scarcely for us to interfere." His mother glanced at him nervously.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	27695	27645	27696	Philip	"I sometimes have given her advice in the past. I should not presume to do so now." "Then is nothing to be done for the child at all?" "It is extraordinarily good of you to take this unexpected interest," said [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	27931	27921	27971	Philip	"Is the young person mad?" burst out [MASK] as soon as she had departed. "Never in my life have I seen such colossal impertinence. She ought to be well smacked, and sent back to Sunday-school." His mother said nothing.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	28175	28159	28205	Philip	Ought the child to grow up in that place--and with that father?" [MASK] started and shuddered. He saw that his mother was not sincere. Her insincerity to others had amused him, but it was disheartening when used against himself.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	28360	28345	28393	Lilia	None the less she is showing me my duty. If I can rescue poor [MASK] s baby from that horrible man, who will bring it up either as Papist or infidel--who will certainly bring it up to be vicious--I shall do it.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	28432	28401	28453	Irma	" "And why not?" said she, flushing at what she knew to be an insult. "Say, if you choose, that I talk like [MASK]. That child has seen the thing more clearly than any of us. She longs for her little brother.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	28879	28851	28899	Monteriano	By it alone, she felt, could she undo a little of the evil that she had permitted to come into the world. To her imagination [MASK] had become a magic city of vice, beneath whose towers no person could grow up happy or pure.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	29569	29536	29585	Philip	" "I have also seen examples of that in my district." With this remark the admirable young woman rose, and returned to keep up her Italian. She puzzled [MASK] extremely. He could understand enthusiasm, but she did not seem the least enthusiastic.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	29792	29791	29841	Gino	" [MASK] wrote in his own language, but the solicitors had sent a laborious English translation, where "Preghiatissima Signora" was rendered as "Most Praiseworthy Madam," and every delicate compliment and superlative--superlatives are delicate in Italian--would have felled an ox.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	29960	29956	30007	Gino	He then read that [MASK] could not accept the generous offer. His paternal heart would not permit him to abandon this symbol of his deplored spouse. As for the picture post-cards, it displeased him greatly that they had been obnoxious. He would send no more.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	30095	30089	30140	Caroline	I must go and tell poor [MASK]. She will be equally distressed." She returned from the visit in the most extraordinary condition. Her face was red, she panted for breath, there were dark circles round her eyes. "The impudence!" she shouted.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	30169	30141	30190	Philip	"The cursed impudence! Oh, I m swearing. I don t care. That beastly woman--how dare she interfere--I ll--[MASK], dear, I m sorry. It s no good. You must go." "Go where?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	41	30288	30275	30316	Abbott	" "If you don t go, she will." "[MASK]?" "Yes. Going alone; would start this evening. I offered to write; she said it was too late! Too late!
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	30324	30314	30364	Irma	Too late! The child, if you please--[MASK] s brother--to live with her, to be brought up by her and her father at our very gates, to go to school like a gentleman, she paying. Oh, you re a man!
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	30547	30508	30553	Harriet	He s a bounder, but he s not an English bounder. He s mysterious and terrible. He s got a country behind him that s upset people from the beginning of the world." "[MASK]!" exclaimed his mother.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	30734	30695	30740	Philip	"It upsets one s plans terribly," she remarked, as she squeezed out her sponges, "but obviously it is my duty." "Did mother explain it all to you?" asked [MASK]. "Yes, indeed!
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	30876	30857	30904	Caroline	Goodness me! I ve forgotten to pack the ammonia!... It has been a terrible lesson for [MASK], but I fancy it is her turning-point. I can t help liking to think that out of all this evil good will come.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	30906	30905	30952	Philip	" [MASK] saw no prospect of good, nor of beauty either. But the expedition promised to be highly comic. He was not averse to it any longer; he was simply indifferent to all in it except the humours. These would be wonderful.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	31147	31114	31159	Harriet	"Supposing we were here for pleasure, what could be more pleasurable than this?" "Did you hear, though, they are remarking on the cold?" said [MASK] nervously. "I should never have thought it cold."
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	31188	31150	31196	Juliet	"I should never have thought it cold." And on the second day the heat struck them, like a hand laid over the mouth, just as they were walking to see the tomb of [MASK]. From that moment everything went wrong.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	31315	31294	31348	Harriet	It was a FESTA, and children blew bladder whistles night and day. "What a religion!" said [MASK]. The hotel smelt, two puppies were asleep on her bed, and her bedroom window looked into a belfry, which saluted her slumbering form every quarter of an hour.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	31444	31415	31463	Florence	"I don t care if there are tunnels; open the windows." He obeyed, and she got another smut in her eye. Nor did [MASK] improve matters. Eating, walking, even a cross word would bathe them both in boiling water.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	41	31541	31524	31565	Harriet	"Singles or returns?" said he. "A single for me," said [MASK] peevishly; "I shall never get back alive." "Sweet creature!" said her brother, suddenly breaking down.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	31587	31579	31631	Harriet	" "Do you suppose," said [MASK], standing still among a whirl of porters--"do you suppose I am going to enter that man s house?" "Then what have you come for, pray? For ornament?" "To see that you do your duty.

WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	32025	32017	32066	Harriet	Then his manner changed. "But, [MASK], do you see nothing wonderful or attractive in that place--nothing at all?" "Nothing at all. It s frightful." "I know it is. But it s old--awfully old.

WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	32625	32623	32677	Harriet	But for [MASK] things were easy, though not jolly, and she turned upon her brother yet again. "What about the baby, pray? You ve said a lot of smart things and whittled away morality and religion and I don t know what; but what about the baby?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	32716	32678	32728	Philip	You think me a fool, but I ve been noticing you all today, and you haven t mentioned the baby once. You haven t thought about it, even. You don t care. [MASK]! I shall not speak to you. You are intolerable.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	32772	32729	32779	Philip	" She kept her promise, and never opened her lips all the rest of the way. But her eyes glowed with anger and resolution. For she was a straight, brave woman, as well as a peevish one. [MASK] acknowledged her reproof to be true.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	32808	32780	32829	Gino	He did not care about the baby one straw. Nevertheless, he meant to do his duty, and he was fairly confident of success. If [MASK] would have sold his wife for a thousand lire, for how much less would he not sell his child?

WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	33777	33766	33820	Harriet	Have you the very slightest sense of the ludicrous?" [MASK] had not; that was why she could be so powerful. She had concocted this scene in the carriage, and nothing should baulk her of it. To the abuse in front and the coaxing behind she was equally indifferent.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	57	33876	33876	33933	Philip	[MASK] s first coherent feeling was one of indignation. To be run by his mother and hectored by his sister was as much as he could stand. The intervention of a third female drove him suddenly beyond politeness. He was about to say exactly what he thought about the thing from beginning to end.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	34095	34045	34096	Harriet	He did not reply to it or approach nearer to her. Without even paying the cabman, he escaped into the street. "Tear each other s eyes out!" he cried, gesticulating at the facade of the hotel. "Give it to her, [MASK]!
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	34109	34097	34144	Caroline	Teach her to leave us alone. Give it to her, [MASK]! Teach her to be grateful to you. Go it, ladies; go it!" Such people as observed him were interested, but did not conclude that he was mad.

WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	35056	35047	35098	Gino	He had written on it a civil request to [MASK] for an interview next morning. But before he placed it in the basket and revealed his identity, he wished to find something out. "Has a young lady happened to call here lately--a young English lady?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	35100	35083	35133	Perfetta	"Has a young lady happened to call here lately--a young English lady?" [MASK] begged his pardon: she was a little deaf. "A young lady--pale, large, tall." She did not quite catch. "A YOUNG LADY!
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	35152	35150	35201	Philip	At last [MASK] admitted the peculiarity and strode away. He paid off the detestable child at the Volterra gate. She got two nickel pieces and was not pleased, partly because it was too much, partly because he did not look pleased when he gave it to her.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	35218	35202	35249	Monteriano	He caught her fathers and cousins winking at each other as he walked past them. [MASK] seemed in one conspiracy to make him look a fool. He felt tired and anxious and muddled, and not sure of anything except that his temper was lost.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	35341	35332	35384	Harriet	"You see," she began, "[MASK] knows nothing." "No more do I. He was out." "But what s that to do with it?" He presented her with an unpleasant smile. She fenced well, as he had noticed before.

WhereAngelsFearToTread	56	35586	35578	35634	Philip	"Spy," she repeated, for [MASK] was bewildered at learning her guilt so easily, and could not answer a word. "Your mother has behaved dishonourably all through. She never wanted the child; no harm in that; but she is too proud to let it come to me.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	35655	35612	35667	Harriet	She never wanted the child; no harm in that; but she is too proud to let it come to me. She has done all she could to wreck things; she did not tell you everything; she has told [MASK] nothing at all; she has lied or acted lies everywhere.

WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	36739	36724	36775	Philip	"What he says and what he thinks is of very little importance." [MASK] smiled at her crudity. "I should like to hear, though, what he said about me. Is he preparing a warm reception?" "Oh, no, not that.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	36783	36767	36817	Harriet	" "Oh, no, not that. I never told him that you and [MASK] were coming. You could have taken him by surprise if you liked. He only asked for you, and wished he hadn t been so rude to you eighteen months ago.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	36911	36874	36924	Philip	She would not let this pass. "You did not think it a little thing at the time. You told me he had assaulted you." "I lost my temper," said [MASK] lightly. His vanity had been appeased, and he knew it.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	36957	36935	36985	Italians	"Did he really--what exactly did he say?" "He said he was sorry--pleasantly, as [MASK] do say such things. But he never mentioned the baby once." What did the baby matter when the world was suddenly right way up?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	37526	37517	37570	Philip	"It reaches up to heaven," said [MASK], "and down to the other place." The summit of the tower was radiant in the sun, while its base was in shadow and pasted over with advertisements. "Is it to be a symbol of the town?

WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	38705	38671	38715	Harriet	In some ways I should enjoy it; but--excuse the suggestion--I don t think we ought to go to cheap seats." "Good gracious me!" cried [MASK], "I should never have thought of that.

WhereAngelsFearToTread	58	39086	39034	39092	Philip	There was also a drop-scene, representing a pink and purple landscape, wherein sported many a lady lightly clad, and two more ladies lay along the top of the proscenium to steady a large and pallid clock. So rich and so appalling was the effect, that [MASK] could scarcely suppress a cry.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	39157	39134	39186	Monteriano	It observes beauty, and chooses to pass it by. But it attains to beauty s confidence. This tiny theatre of [MASK] spraddled and swaggered with the best of them, and these ladies with their clock would have nodded to the young men on the ceiling of the Sistine.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	39495	39477	39528	Harriet	The audience accompanied with tappings and drummings, swaying in the melody like corn in the wind. [MASK], though she did not care for music, knew how to listen to it. She uttered an acid "Shish!" "Shut it," whispered her brother.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	56	39566	39565	39621	Harriet	" [MASK] shook her head and shished again. The people were quiet, not because it is wrong to talk during a chorus, but because it is natural to be civil to a visitor. For a little time she kept the whole house in order, and could smile at her brother complacently.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	39673	39664	39708	Harriet	But soon the boxes began to fill, and [MASK] s power was over. Families greeted each other across the auditorium. People in the pit hailed their brothers and sons in the chorus, and told them how well they were singing.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	39801	39795	39840	Lucia	I wish we d never--" [MASK] began to sing, and there was a moment s silence. She was stout and ugly; but her voice was still beautiful, and as she sang the theatre murmured like a hive of happy bees.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	39919	39897	39946	Philip	She, too, chatted and laughed and applauded and encored, and rejoiced in the existence of beauty. As for [MASK], he forgot himself as well as his mission. He was not even an enthusiastic visitor. For he had been in this place always.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	39998	39986	40035	Caroline	She looked round grimly. The audience sounded drunk, and even [MASK], who never took a drop, was swaying oddly. Violent waves of excitement, all arising from very little, went sweeping round the theatre. The climax was reached in the mad scene.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	40036	40010	40060	Lucia	Violent waves of excitement, all arising from very little, went sweeping round the theatre. The climax was reached in the mad scene. [MASK], clad in white, as befitted her malady, suddenly gathered up her streaming hair and bowed her acknowledgment to the audience.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	40107	40092	40143	Lucia	It was very ugly, and most of the flowers in it were false. [MASK] knew this, and so did the audience; and they all knew that the clothes-horse was a piece of stage property, brought in to make the performance go year after year.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	40271	40253	40304	Lucia	"Let the divine creature continue!" But the young men in the adjacent box were imploring [MASK] to extend her civility to them. She refused, with a humorous, expressive gesture. One of them hurled a bouquet at her. She spurned it with her foot.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	40325	40279	40329	Harriet	She refused, with a humorous, expressive gesture. One of them hurled a bouquet at her. She spurned it with her foot. Then, encouraged by the roars of the audience, she picked it up and tossed it to them. [MASK] was always unfortunate.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	40374	40330	40381	Philip	The bouquet struck her full in the chest, and a little billet-doux fell out of it into her lap. "Call this classical!" she cried, rising from her seat. "It s not even respectable! [MASK]! take me out at once.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	40453	40453	40500	Philip	[MASK], still laughing and calling "Whose is it?" brought up the rear. He was drunk with excitement. The heat, the fatigue, and the enjoyment had mounted into his head. "To the left!" the people cried.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	40531	40491	40540	Philip	"To the left!" the people cried. "The innamorato is to the left." He deserted his ladies and plunged towards the box. A young man was flung stomach downwards across the balustrade. [MASK] handed him up the bouquet and the note.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	40587	40541	40589	Philip	Then his own hands were seized affectionately. It all seemed quite natural. "Why have you not written?" cried the young man. "Why do you take me by surprise?" "Oh, I ve written," said [MASK] hilariously.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	40652	40631	40674	Philip	"No! no!" cried the young man. "You don t escape me now." For [MASK] was trying feebly to disengage his hands. Amiable youths bent out of the box and invited him to enter it.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	40886	40886	40936	Philip	[MASK] would have a spasm of horror at the muddle he had made. But the spasm would pass, and again he would be enchanted by the kind, cheerful voices, the laughter that was never vapid, and the light caress of the arm across his back.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	58	40950	40900	40958	Edgardo	But the spasm would pass, and again he would be enchanted by the kind, cheerful voices, the laughter that was never vapid, and the light caress of the arm across his back. He could not get away till the play was nearly finished, and [MASK] was singing amongst the tombs of ancestors.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	41039	41039	41087	Harriet	[MASK], it seemed, had gone straight to bed. "That was he, wasn t it?" she asked. "Yes, rather." "I suppose you didn t settle anything?" "Why, no; how could I?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	41668	41663	41716	Perfetta	It was no business of [MASK] s to be shocked, and the style of the visitor seemed to demand the reception-room. Accordingly she opened its shutters, dusted a round patch on one of the horsehair chairs, and bade the lady do herself the inconvenience of sitting down.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	42011	41997	42046	Harriet	If she failed she could scarcely look them in the face again. "[MASK] and her brother," she reasoned, "don t realize what is before them. She would bluster and be rude; he would be pleasant and take it as a joke.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	56	42554	42512	42568	Perfetta	It was preferable to the charnel-chamber in which she was standing now, and the light in it was soft and large, as from some gracious, noble opening. He stopped singing, and cried "Where is [MASK]?" His back was turned, and he was lighting a cigar.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	42629	42585	42635	Hamlet	The vista of the landing and the two open doors made him both remote and significant, like an actor on the stage, intimate and unapproachable at the same time. She could no more call out to him than if he was [MASK]. "You know!"
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	42836	42822	42867	Bari	I cannot tell you why; I have a feeling this week for [MASK]." Again she tried to speak. But the ring mesmerized her. It had become vast and elliptical, and floated in at the reception-room door.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	42889	42839	42890	Gino	Again she tried to speak. But the ring mesmerized her. It had become vast and elliptical, and floated in at the reception-room door. "Ah! you don t care if you get the profits. You won t even say Thank you, [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	42910	42891	42945	Gino--	Say it, or I ll drop hot, red-hot ashes on you. Thank you, [MASK] " The ring had extended its pale blue coils towards her. She lost self-control. It enveloped her. As if it was a breath from the pit, she screamed.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	44183	44170	44218	Gino	She remembered, though, that she was not here to sympathize with [MASK]--at all events, not to show that she sympathized. She also reminded herself that he was not worthy of sympathy. "It is a large house," she repeated.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	44559	44553	44604	Lilia	It is not a year since [MASK] died. You pretended to me the other day that you loved her. It is a lie. You wanted her money. Has this woman money too?" "Why, yes!" he said irritably. "A little.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	44655	44618	44662	Lilia	" "I shall not say it. It will be untrue. Now my poor wife--" He stopped, seeing that the comparison would involve him in difficulties. And indeed he had often found [MASK] as agreeable as any one else.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	44737	44691	44746	Gino	She glowed and throbbed; her tongue moved nimbly. At the finish, if the real business of the day had been completed, she could have swept majestically from the house. But the baby still remained, asleep on a dirty rug. [MASK] was thoughtful, and stood scratching his head.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	44878	44851	44900	Signorina	He laid his hand upon his own heart. "Then God help her!" He stamped impatiently. "Whatever I say displeases you, [MASK]. God help you, for you are most unfair. You say that I ill-treated my dear wife.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	45008	45003	45052	Lilia	" "To succeed where [MASK] failed! To be your housekeeper, your slave, you--" The words she would like to have said were too violent for her. "To look after the baby, certainly," said he. "The baby--?"
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	45239	45192	45243	Perfetta	" She looked at his face. It was apparently innocent of satire. "You meant that we could not always be together yet, he and I. You are right. What is to be done? I cannot afford a nurse, and [MASK] is too rough.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	45885	45883	45931	Gino	And when [MASK] pointed first to himself and then to his baby and said "father-son," she still took it as a piece of nursery prattle, and smiled mechanically. The child, the first fruits, woke up and glared at her.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	45932	45918	45972	Gino	The child, the first fruits, woke up and glared at her. [MASK] did not greet it, but continued the exposition of his policy. "This woman will do exactly what I tell her. She is fond of children. She is clean; she has a pleasant voice.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	46329	46321	46371	Philip	All she could do now was to find [MASK], confess her miserable defeat, and bid him go in her stead and prosper better. She cursed her feebleness; she longed to expose it, without apologies or tears. "Oh, but stop a moment!"
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	46551	46507	46558	Gino	He cannot help it; he is made out of me; I am his father." It was too late to go. She could not tell why, but it was too late. She turned away her head when [MASK] lifted his son to his lips.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	46773	46761	46811	Gino	She understood little babies from long experience in a district, and [MASK] soon ceased to give her directions, and only gave her thanks. "It is very kind of you," he murmured, "especially in your beautiful dress. He is nearly clean already.

WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	47179	47138	47186	Philip	he exclaimed; for he was glad to find things in such cheerful trim. She did not greet him, but rose up unsteadily and handed the baby to his father. "No, do stop!" whispered [MASK]. "I got your note.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	47235	47197	47246	Signorina	I really want you; I could never have done it alone." No words came from her, but she raised her hands to her mouth, like one who is in sudden agony. "[MASK], do stop a little--after all your kindness.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	47260	47247	47293	Philip	" She burst into tears. "What is it?" said [MASK] kindly. She tried to speak, and then went away weeping bitterly. The two men stared at each other. By a common impulse they ran on to the loggia.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	47995	47995	48040	Gino	[MASK] was too courteous: he would not break off negotiations by sharp denial; he loved this civil, half-humorous bargaining. And he loved fooling his opponent, and did it so nicely that his opponent did not mind being fooled.

WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	48346	48313	48357	Harriet	For she has made quite an impression on him. He thinks her so nice with the baby. You know, she washed it for him." "Disgusting!" [MASK] s ejaculations were more aggravating than the rest of her.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	48443	48429	48474	Harriet	" "There can be no peace between me and her," said [MASK] gloomily. "Did you--" "Oh, not all I wanted. She went away before I had finished speaking--just like those cowardly people!--into the church.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	48499	48475	48521	Philip	" "Into Santa Deodata s?" "Yes; I m sure she needs it. Anything more unchristian--" In time [MASK] went to the church also, leaving his sister a little calmer and a little disposed to think over his advice.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	48568	48563	48611	Monteriano	For the second time, [MASK] must have turned her head. He was not angry with her, for he was quite indifferent to the outcome of their expedition. He was only extremely interested. It was now nearly midday, and the streets were clearing.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	58	48917	48889	48947	Philip	One of the canons had unhooked it just before the FIESTA began, and had given it to the sacristan s daughter. "Please," cried [MASK], "is there an English lady here?" The man s mouth was full of tin-tacks, but he nodded cheerfully towards a kneeling figure.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	49179	49130	49180	Philip	If I had planned the whole thing out, I could not have treated you worse. I can talk it over now; but please believe that I have been crying." "And please believe that I have not come to scold you," said [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	49343	49329	49379	Harriet	But I must ask you to withdraw from the thing for the present. [MASK] is furious. But she will calm down when she realizes that you have done us no harm, and will do none." "I can do no more," she said.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	49472	49467	49514	Harriet	I ll go and tell [MASK] of your promise, and I think things ll quiet down now." But he did not move, for it was an increasing pleasure to him to be near her, and her charm was at its strongest today.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	57	49712	49656	49713	lo	There was a window open behind her, revealing just such a view as he had seen that morning, and on her widowed mother s dresser there stood just such another copper pot. The saint looked neither at the view nor at the pot, and at her widowed mother still less. For [MASK]!
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	49786	49786	49836	Philip	[MASK] started, not so much at the words as at the sudden change in the voice. "Do?" he echoed, rather dismayed. "This afternoon I have another interview." "It will come to nothing. Well?" "Then another.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	50485	50463	50511	Lilia	I m one of them; I never did anything at school or at the Bar. I came out to stop [MASK] s marriage, and it was too late. I came out intending to get the baby, and I shall return an honourable failure.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	50768	50723	50773	Harriet	She could not prove it. No argument existed. Their discourse, splendid as it had been, resulted in nothing, and their respective opinions and policies were exactly the same when they left the church as when they had entered it. [MASK] was rude at lunch.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	42	50839	50831	50873	Philip	She got more and more violent, and [MASK] at one time feared that she would come to blows. "Look here!" he cried, with something of the old manner, "it s too hot for this.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	50920	50874	50921	Harriet	We ve been talking and interviewing each other all the morning, and I have another interview this afternoon. I do stipulate for silence. Let each lady retire to her bedroom with a book." "I retire to pack," said [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	51052	51016	51065	Harriet	"Why not?" "Why, of course you would be going. Two carriages, then. Two carriages for the evening train." He looked at his sister hopelessly. "[MASK], whatever are you up to? We shall never be ready.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	51160	51134	51183	Harriet	But--I can t repeat all that I said in the church. You ought never to see him again. You ought to bundle [MASK] into a carriage, not this evening, but now, and drive her straight away." "Perhaps I ought.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	51218	51204	51252	Gino	Why, I can see the splendour of it--even the humour. [MASK] sitting up here on the mountain-top with his cub. We come and ask for it. He welcomes us. We ask for it again. He is equally pleasant.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	51345	51296	51346	Harriet	But I m not a fine character. And nothing hangs on it." "Perhaps I am extreme," she said humbly. "I ve been trying to run you, just like your mother. I feel you ought to fight it out with [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	42	51632	51621	51663	Philip	"Well, I have done my best," said [MASK], dipping a long slice of sugar into his cup, and watching the brown liquid ascend into it. "I shall face my mother with a good conscience.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	51692	51653	51701	Philip	"I shall face my mother with a good conscience. Will you bear me witness that I ve done my best?" "My poor fellow, I will!" He laid a sympathetic hand on [MASK] s knee. "And that I have--"
WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	51739	51696	51740	Harriet	"And that I have--" The sugar was now impregnated with coffee, and he bent forward to swallow it. As he did so his eyes swept the opposite of the Piazza, and he saw there, watching them, [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	52057	52028	52081	Philip	Or--to put the thing less cynically--we may be better in new clean words, which have never been tainted by our pettiness or vice. [MASK], at all events, lived more graciously in Italian, the very phrases of which entice one to be happy and kind.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	52113	52113	52163	Harriet	[MASK], however, talked little. She had seen enough to know that her brother had failed again, and with unwonted dignity she accepted the situation. She did her packing, she wrote up her diary, she made a brown paper cover for the new Baedeker.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	57	52164	52120	52177	Philip	She had seen enough to know that her brother had failed again, and with unwonted dignity she accepted the situation. She did her packing, she wrote up her diary, she made a brown paper cover for the new Baedeker. [MASK], finding her so amenable, tried to discuss their future plans.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	52252	52252	52301	Harriet	[MASK] sighed, but indicated to her brother that he was not responsible. The carriages came round at a quarter past eight. It was not raining much, but the night was extraordinarily dark, and one of the drivers wanted to go slowly to the station.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	56	52326	52319	52375	Philip	"Yes, do," said [MASK], who was standing in the hall. "Now that we have quarrelled we scarcely want to travel in procession all the way down the hill. Well, good-bye; it s all over at last; another scene in my pageant has shifted.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	52643	52589	52644	Harriet	He believed that he understood her, and that she, by now, had seen the worst of him. What if after a long time--if after all--he flushed like a boy as he looked after her carriage. He went into the dining-room to look for [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	52874	52864	52913	Philip	A man came up the street with a note. [MASK] read, "Start at once. Pick me up outside the gate. Pay the bearer. H. H." "Did the lady give you this note?" he cried. The man was unintelligible.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	52920	52893	52943	Philip	H. H." "Did the lady give you this note?" he cried. The man was unintelligible. "Speak up!" exclaimed [MASK]. "Who gave it you--and where?" Nothing but horrible sighings and bubblings came out of the man.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	52997	52969	53018	Philip	And the landlady came out of the hotel and echoed "The poor idiot. He cannot speak. He takes messages for us all." [MASK] then saw that the messenger was a ghastly creature, quite bald, with trickling eyes and grey twitching nose.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	53271	53230	53279	Philip	He shook hands with the landlady, gave the messenger a nickel piece, and drove away. After a dozen yards the carriage stopped. The poor idiot was running and whimpering behind. "Go on," cried [MASK]. "I have paid him plenty.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	53325	53309	53361	Philip	This was the change out of the nickel piece. "Go on!" shouted [MASK], and flung the money into the road. He was frightened at the episode; the whole of life had become unreal. It was a relief to be out of the Siena gate.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	53378	53335	53387	Harriet	He was frightened at the episode; the whole of life had become unreal. It was a relief to be out of the Siena gate. They drew up for a moment on the terrace. But there was no sign of [MASK]. The driver called to the Dogana men.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	53489	53468	53512	Harriet	And there she was, waiting for them in the wet, at the first turn of the zigzag. "[MASK], why don t you answer?" "I heard you coming," said she, and got quickly in.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	53532	53497	53544	Hush--	" "I heard you coming," said she, and got quickly in. Not till then did he see that she carried a bundle. "What s that?" "[MASK]" "Whatever is that?" "Hush--sleeping.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	58	53872	53872	53930	Monteriano	[MASK] had long disappeared, and he could see nothing but the occasional wet stem of an olive, which their lamp illumined as they passed it. They travelled quickly, for this driver did not care how fast he went to the station, and would dash down each incline and scuttle perilously round the curves.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	53935	53900	53954	Harriet	They travelled quickly, for this driver did not care how fast he went to the station, and would dash down each incline and scuttle perilously round the curves. "Look here, [MASK]," he said at last, "I feel bad; I want to see the baby.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	53989	53955	54006	Harriet	" "Hush!" "I don t mind if I do wake him up. I want to see him. I ve as much right in him as you." [MASK] gave in. But it was too dark for him to see the child s face.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	54058	54034	54085	Philip	"But he s awake!" he exclaimed. The match went out. "Good ickle quiet boysey, then." [MASK] winced. "His face, do you know, struck me as all wrong." "All wrong?" "All puckered queerly.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	54142	54101	54153	Harriet	" "Well, hold him up again." She did so. He lit another match. It went out quickly, but not before he had seen that the baby was crying. "Nonsense," said [MASK] sharply. "We should hear him if he cried.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	56	54175	54154	54210	Harriet	" "No, he s crying hard; I thought so before, and I m certain now." [MASK] touched the child s face. It was bathed in tears. "Oh, the night air, I suppose," she said, "or perhaps the wet of the rain.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	54247	54211	54260	Perfetta	" "I say, you haven t hurt it, or held it the wrong way, or anything; it is too uncanny--crying and no noise. Why didn t you get [MASK] to carry it to the hotel instead of muddling with the messenger?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	54351	54310	54359	Philip	Must I say it again? Don t talk. The baby wants to sleep." She crooned harshly as they descended, and now and then she wiped up the tears which welled inexhaustibly from the little eyes. [MASK] looked away, winking at times himself.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	54519	54487	54539	Harriet	It could not be good for the child. "I suppose he breathes, and all that sort of thing?" he said. "Of course," said [MASK], in an angry whisper. "You ve started him again. I m certain he was asleep.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	54580	54575	54627	Gino	I m terribly sorry for [MASK]." "Are you?" "Because he s weak--like most of us. He doesn t know what he wants. He doesn t grip on to life. But I like that man, and I m sorry for him.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	54641	54607	54656	Harriet	He doesn t grip on to life. But I like that man, and I m sorry for him." Naturally enough she made no answer. "You despise him, [MASK], and you despise me. But you do us no good by it.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	54796	54773	54821	Harriet	Try again." They entered the little wood as he tried to strike the third match. At last it caught. [MASK] poised the umbrella rightly, and for a full quarter minute they contemplated the face that trembled in the light of the trembling flame.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	54845	54845	54894	Philip	[MASK] was a good deal hurt. He sat up and rocked himself to and fro, holding his arm. He could just make out the outline of the carriage above him, and the outlines of the carriage cushions and of their luggage upon the grey road.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	54926	54895	54942	Harriet	The accident had taken place in the wood, where it was even darker than in the open. "Are you all right?" he managed to say. [MASK] was screaming, the horse was kicking, the driver was cursing some other man.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	54978	54949	55002	Philip	"The baby--the baby--it slipped--it s gone from my arms--I stole it!" "God help me!" said [MASK]. A cold circle came round his mouth, and, he fainted. When he recovered it was still the same confusion.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	55016	55003	55053	Harriet	The horse was kicking, the baby had not been found, and [MASK] still screamed like a maniac, "I stole it! I stole it! I stole it! It slipped out of my arms!" "Keep still!" he commanded the driver.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	55376	55340	55387	Harriet	He shook the bundle; he breathed into it; he opened his coat and pressed it against him. Then he listened, and heard nothing but the rain and the panting horses, and [MASK], who was somewhere chuckling to herself in the dark.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	55533	55490	55535	Philip	But how far this was the result of ill-temper, to what extent she had been fortified by her religion, when and how she had met the poor idiot--these questions were never answered, nor did they interest [MASK] greatly.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	55693	55668	55721	Philip	The passion they have aroused lives after them, easy to transmute or to transfer, but well-nigh impossible to destroy. And [MASK] knew that he was still voyaging on the same magnificent, perilous sea, with the sun or the clouds above him, and the tides below.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	56132	56089	56144	Gino	The trouble was in the elbow-joint, and as long as he kept this motionless he could go on as usual. But inflammation was beginning, and the slightest jar gave him agony. The sling was not fitted before [MASK] leapt up the stairs, crying-- "So you are back!
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	56155	56145	56188	Philip	How glad I am! We are all waiting--" [MASK] had seen too much to be nervous. In low, even tones he told what had happened; and the other, also perfectly calm, heard him to the end.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	45	56192	56164	56209	Perfetta	In low, even tones he told what had happened; and the other, also perfectly calm, heard him to the end. In the silence [MASK] called up that she had forgotten the baby s evening milk; she must fetch it.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	41	56291	56281	56322	Philip	Now and then he frowned a little and glanced at [MASK]. "It is through me," he continued. "It happened because I was cowardly and idle. I have come to know what you will do.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	56324	56293	56345	Gino	"It is through me," he continued. "It happened because I was cowardly and idle. I have come to know what you will do." [MASK] had left the rug, and began to pat the table from the end, as if he was blind.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	56417	56370	56424	Philip	" He went up and touched him on the shoulder. He twitched away, and began to pass his hands over things more rapidly--over the table, the chairs, the entire floor, the walls as high as he could reach them. [MASK] had not presumed to comfort him.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	56440	56425	56475	Gino	But now the tension was too great--he tried. "Break down, [MASK]; you must break down. Scream and curse and give in for a little; you must break down." There was no reply, and no cessation of the sweeping hands.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	56514	56462	56515	Philip	" There was no reply, and no cessation of the sweeping hands. "It is time to be unhappy. Break down or you will be ill like my sister. You will go--" The tour of the room was over. He had touched everything in it except [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	56618	56582	56633	Philip	He died in my arms, remember. It does not excuse me; but he did die in my arms." The left hand came forward, slowly this time. It hovered before [MASK] like an insect. Then it descended and gripped him by his broken elbow.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	55	56646	56646	56701	Gino	[MASK] fell to the blow without a cry or a word. "You brute!" exclaimed the Englishman. "Kill me if you like! But just you leave my broken arm alone." Then he was seized with remorse, and knelt beside his adversary and tried to revive him.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	56750	56702	56753	Gino	He managed to raise him up, and propped his body against his own. He passed his arm round him. Again he was filled with pity and tenderness. He awaited the revival without fear, sure that both of them were safe at last. [MASK] recovered suddenly.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	56786	56771	56824	Philip	But he scrambled up in silence, remembering everything, and he made not towards [MASK], but towards the lamp. "Do what you like; but think first--" The lamp was tossed across the room, out through the loggia. It broke against one of the trees below.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	56845	56845	56898	Philip	[MASK] spun round with a yell. He had only been pinched on the back, but he knew what was in store for him. He struck out, exhorting the devil to fight him, to kill him, to do anything but this. Then he stumbled to the door.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	56951	56943	56994	Gino	His senses grew sharper. He could hear [MASK] coming in on tiptoe. He even knew what was passing in his mind, how now he was at fault, now he was hopeful, now he was wondering whether after all the victim had not escaped down the stairs.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	42	57083	57059	57101	Philip	But when it is caused by the malignity of a man, full grown, fashioned like ourselves, all our control disappears. [MASK] s one thought was to get away from that room at whatever sacrifice of nobility or pride.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	57131	57119	57166	Philip	Suddenly the instinct came to him. He crawled quickly to where [MASK] lay and had him clean by the elbow. The whole arm seemed red-hot, and the broken bone grated in the joint, sending out shoots of the essence of pain.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	57177	57141	57190	Gino	The whole arm seemed red-hot, and the broken bone grated in the joint, sending out shoots of the essence of pain. His other arm was pinioned against the wall, and [MASK] had trampled in behind the stove and was kneeling on his legs.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	44	57257	57231	57275	Gino	At first he was glad, for here, he thought, was death at last. But it was only a new torture; perhaps [MASK] inherited the skill of his ancestors--and childlike ruffians who flung each other from the towers.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	57288	57276	57330	Philip	Just as the windpipe closed, the hand fell off, and [MASK] was revived by the motion of his arm. And just as he was about to faint and gain at last one moment of oblivion, the motion stopped, and he would struggle instead against the pressure on his throat.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	57391	57369	57420	Gino	He felt that he was growing weaker; his brain wandered; the agony did not seem so great. Not all [MASK] s care could indefinitely postpone the end. His yells and gurgles became mechanical--functions of the tortured flesh rather than true notes of indignation and despair.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	57453	57400	57454	Gino	His yells and gurgles became mechanical--functions of the tortured flesh rather than true notes of indignation and despair. He was conscious of a horrid tumbling. Then his arm was pulled a little too roughly, and everything was quiet at last. "But your son is dead, [MASK].
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	57536	57505	57552	Philip	"What is the good of another death? What is the good of more pain?" He too began to tremble. Then he turned and looked curiously at [MASK], whose face, covered with dust and foam, was visible by the stove.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	57761	57739	57790	Perfetta	Then she said gravely to them both, "This thing stops here." "Latte! latte!" cried [MASK], hilariously ascending the stairs. "Remember," she continued, "there is to be no revenge. I will have no more intentional evil.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	57812	57768	57819	Philip	"Remember," she continued, "there is to be no revenge. I will have no more intentional evil. We are not to fight with each other any more." "I shall never forgive him," sighed [MASK]. "Latte! latte freschissima!
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	58072	58051	58099	Philip	And it seemed fitting, too, that she should bend her head and touch his forehead with her lips. [MASK] looked away, as he sometimes looked away from the great pictures where visible forms suddenly become inadequate for the things they have shown to us.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	58226	58213	58267	Gino	"Is there any left?" "A little," answered [MASK]. "Then finish it." For she was determined to use such remnants as lie about the world. "Will you not have some?" "I do not care for milk; finish it all.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	46	58316	58291	58337	Perfetta	" He drank the milk, and then, either by accident or in some spasm of pain, broke the jug to pieces. [MASK] exclaimed in bewilderment. "It does not matter," he told her. "It does not matter.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	43	58592	58556	58599	Gino	" "Indeed I will." He was surprised that she could slide away from the man so easily. For his own part, he was bound by ties of almost alarming intimacy. [MASK] had the southern knack of friendship.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	58609	58600	58648	Philip	In the intervals of business he would pull out [MASK] s life, turn it inside out, remodel it, and advise him how to use it for the best. The sensation was pleasant, for he was a kind as well as a skilful operator.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	47	58767	58757	58804	Siena	"I hope next spring. Perhaps we shall paint [MASK] red for a day or two with some of the new wife s money. It was one of the arguments for marrying her." "He has no heart," she said severely.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	49	58910	58879	58928	Gino	" "In his passion. Not when he was calm. We English say it when we are calm--when we do not really believe it any longer. [MASK] is not ashamed of inconsistency. It is one of the many things I like him for.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	52	58956	58917	58969	Philip	It is one of the many things I like him for." "Yes; I was wrong. That is so." "He s much more honest with himself than I am," continued [MASK], "and he is honest without an effort and without pride.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	48	59166	59141	59189	Gino	The beauties that are called obvious--the beauties of her hair and her voice and her limbs--he had noticed these last; [MASK], who never traversed any path at all, had commended them dispassionately to his friend. Why was he so puzzling?
WhereAngelsFearToTread	51	59272	59266	59317	Harriet	The train was nearly empty. [MASK] slumbered in a compartment by herself. He must ask her these questions now, and he returned quickly to her down the corridor. She greeted him with a question of her own. "Are your plans decided?" "Yes.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	59416	59371	59421	Harriet	Still it s over; our family circle need be vexed no more. She won t even be angry with you. You see, you have done us no harm in the long run. Unless, of course, you talk about [MASK] and make a scandal.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	53	59603	59560	59613	Harriet	Life was greater than he had supposed, but it was even less complete. He had seen the need for strenuous work and for righteousness. And now he saw what a very little way those things would go. "Is [MASK] going to be all right?" he asked.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	59637	59636	59686	Harriet	For [MASK], after a short paroxysm of illness and remorse, was quickly returning to her normal state. She had been "thoroughly upset" as she phrased it, but she soon ceased to realize that anything was wrong beyond the death of a poor little child.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	50	60121	60108	60158	Gino	And the next day--in the church; and our times with [MASK]." "All the wonderful things are over," she said. "That is just where it is." "I don t believe it. At all events not for me.
WhereAngelsFearToTread	54	60728	60728	60782	Gino	[MASK]! He heard himself remark "Rather! I love him too! When I can forget how he hurt me that evening. Though whenever we shake hands--" One of them must have moved a step or two, for when she spoke again she was already a little way apart.
